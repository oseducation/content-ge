## While interviewing Users Focus on Problems, not Features

Let's discuss listening to your users during interviews. You may be buzzing to get quick answers, it might seem the easy thing to do, but we need to step back a little. An important point I want to underline is a common mistake during customer talks: focusing more on the features of your product instead of the issues your users face. 

It's human nature to do this. As the problem solver at heart, you're already trying to find solutions to these issues. But here's the crucial thing: interviews are there to get to the heart of what troubles users, rather than brainstorm solutions. We'll save problem-solving for another time. 

You see, users generally spot good problems but might not be the best at coming up with solutions. I want to share two real-world examples with you to illustrate this point. 

Take the early days of Gmail. Many users asked Paul Buchheit, Gmail's creator, for a chance to see both their inbox and the actual email message all in one go. You might wonder why. The simple reason was that Gmail was a bit of a slowpoke back then, making people wait to load each email. So, they wanted to see everything at once to save time. 

Next, Airbnb. In its initial phase, many guests wanted the phone numbers of their hosts. But why, you might ask. Well, it turned out that guests were not fully sure they could trust Airbnb. They felt better getting to know their host before booking a stay.

Now, here's another important note to remember: users will generally not say no to extra features. If you offer a bundle of features, they will most likely say yes to all of them. However, remember that you're the captain of this ship. You are responsible for what goes into your product and it's up to you to figure out what's essential. 

In conclusion, when talking to users, lean towards understanding their problems instead of displaying your product features. This will help you make well-informed decisions for your product.
