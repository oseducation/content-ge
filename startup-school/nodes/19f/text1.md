## Understanding the Simple Agreement for Equity (SAFE)

**SAFE, or Simple Agreement for Equity**, has really changed the way people do business in the startup world. This new guy on the block was rolled out in 2013 by an organization called Y Combinator, often simply called YC. They dreamt it up as an easy, understandable, and straightforward deal document for all the startups they worked with.

But, guess what? The SAFE was so good, that nearly all startups started using it to raise funds. It's a bit like stumbling on an easy recipe that gets raving reviews at parties, and suddenly, everyone's making it! 

Now, why is SAFE such a hit? 

1. **Easy to Understand**: It's just five pages long. You can read it over a cup of coffee. No legalese traps. 

2. **Quick to Close**: You can wrap up an investment deal using a SAFE in no time. All you need to haggle over are the investment amount and the valuation cap. Are you wondering about the discount? Usually, no one does discounting with SAFEs, so we can sidestep that.

3. **Inexpensive**: You can give your lawyer the day off. SAFEs cost nothing to send. Best of all, if you want to give SAFE a whirl, just search for 'Y Combinator SAFE' online. You can download it straight from the YC website and start using it to secure investment this very afternoon. 

Love the marvel of modern technology? So do we! There's a platform called Clerky, actually created by a YC company that stumbled onto this brilliant idea back in the summer of 2011. Clerky lets you send and sign SAFEs with just a few clicks.

This little document, SAFE, has given **fundraising superpowers to founders**. They don't have to wait forever for investors to pull themselves together or for lawyers to comb through the fine print. Instead, it's about having meetings, signing a bunch SAFEs, and raising a ton of money for their startups in quick time. This speed and low-cost option give them an upper hand when talking to investors. Now, isn't that cool?
