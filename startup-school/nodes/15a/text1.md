## Importance of Hands-On Approach Early in a Startup's Lifecycle

Letâ€™s discuss something important. If you've ever been curious about running your own startup, you might have come across an essay called "*Do Things That Don't Scale*" by Paul Graham. Paul Graham is one of the folks who started Y-Combinator, a famous startup program, and this essay talks about how some of the biggest companies we know today, like Airbnb, got their start. 

You might think that having a great product or service is all you need to succeed, but that's just part of the picture. The reality is, that no product is ever perfect right from the start, especially not in the case of startups. When you show your product to your first customers, they might not find it that amazing. Why? Because usually you don't build your great product in a vacuum but closely with your customers, adapting it to their needs.

Now, you may think your startup is like a bird that will just fledge and fly off on its own once it's ready. But the thing is, it won't. Not without your help. As the founder, you are the one to give it a push to get it off the ground. This means you have to take an active role in finding your customers. That 'publish and they will come' strategy won't cut it. 

Many people fall into a trap - believing they can simply create more code, or work a bit more on their product, and then customers will come running. From my experience, and many other founders can attest to this, that simply doesn't work. 

So, why am I saying all this? Because there is a very crucial lesson to learn here - knowing how to sell your product isn't the only important thing when it comes to running a successful startup; it's about you. Yes, you, the founder. Having the desire to succeed and actively engaging in the process is what will truly make the difference. 

Remember, your startup won't just take off on its own, but with your guidance and hands-on work, it can soar high.
