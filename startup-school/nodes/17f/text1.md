## Dominance of SaaS (Software as a Service) Businesses in Startups

Okay, so in a world full of business types, SaaS, or as some may call it "Software as a Service" businesses seem to take the lead. Why's that, you ask? Well, it mainly lies in their nature of bringing in reliable income. 

Just think about it, over 31% of the top 100 companies that came from Y Combinator (a well-known startup guide) are SaaS businesses! That's nearly one-third! The secret to their success? The magic of 'recurring revenue'. 

In simple words, it means the money keeps flowing every month, or sometimes every year, unless the customer stops it. Because they are paid regularly for the service, they have this steady stream of income. This isn't like a one-time deal sale, and that's what makes them special.

Thanks to this predictable cash, they can plan, make smarter decisions and most importantly, ensure their growth. This sort of plan lets them set up strong roots and expand without worrying about sudden money problems. So in a nutshell, this whole concept is about steady growth and consistent income, which is why SaaS businesses often outshine others.
