## The Importance and Strategy of Pricing in Startups

Alright, let's chat about something very important: Charging for your product. I know it might feel good to give away your product for free. You may think about free trials or not charging for pilot runs. These can take on different models and forms. But listen closely – if you aren't charging your clients, they aren't truly your customers, and your business really isn't a business. Earning income from customers is a clear sign that your product has value, so it's worth it!

At this point, you might feel scared about hearing 'no' when you throw out a price. But you know what? That might not be a bad thing. Instead of worrying about what the 'right' price might be, use early interactions – like the first call or meeting – to feel out if a customer is willing to pay. If they flat-out reject any form of payment, it's a good sign that they might not be the best fit for you. Remember, don’t waste too much energy on wrong-fit customers. Time is precious, so feel free to “fire” customers who are unwilling to pay and focus on those who see value in your products.

For consumer products, free trials are typical. But look closely. Most of these 'free' trials actually take your credit card details at the start, and before you know it, you're a paying subscriber because you forgot about the end of the free period. This model seems to work well for consumer products.

However, in the world of B2B sales, it's a slightly different ball game. Instead of offering free trials, think about other, more attractive options. Like money-back guarantees. Pitch it like this: “Hey, we’re so sure you’ll love our product that if you're not happy, you can have your money back within 30, 60 days or whatever. That sounds promising, right?

Or even better, instead of locking customers into an annual contract, give them the option to opt out anytime after, let's say, a month or so.

Finally, don't be scared to slowly push your price up. As long as your customers are still willing to pay, even if they grumble a little, you're on the right track. Remember, the goal is to build a successful company, which often means finding the right price for delivering real value. You've got this!
