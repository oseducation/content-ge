## Different Types of Launches

So, you want to come up with a great one-sentence pitch for your startup and launch it wisely. Don't worry, we've got your back. In the world of startups, continuous and strategic launch is one of the secrets of successful companies. 

### Why Launch Continuously?

It's all about learning. By launching your product early, even if it isn't perfect yet, you get to see what works, what doesn't, and how people react to your idea. You may even find out if you're dealing with the right users because different communication channels will give you different audiences. Now let's dive into some types of launches you can explore.

### Understanding Different Types of Launches

#### 1. The Silent Launch

This is a must and you can do it while you're at the planning stage. It doesn't need to be anything expensive. At this stage, all you need is:

- A domain name for your startup
- The name of your company
- A short description of what you do 
- A way for users to contact you
- A call to action, like a registration for a newsletter

Just to give you an idea, a company called 'Lara' launched with only a domain name, a short description and a sign-up option for their waitlist.

#### 2. Friends and Family Launch

At this stage, test your idea on friends and family. You can share a one to two-sentence pitch and ask for their feedback. But remember not to stay in this phase for too long because your friends and family may not be the ideal users for your product.

#### 3. Stranger Launch

It's always good to get feedback from potential real users. For instance, when DoorDash was in its early stages, they spent a lot of time talking to store owners and found out that deliveries were a pain for small business owners. They then developed an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to solve that problem. Remember, always be ready to talk to potential customers as soon as possible.

#### 4. Online Community Launch

This is where you introduce your startup to the online communities you are a part of. Y Combinator (YC), an American seed money startup accelerator, has a community platform called 'Bookface' where it's a great place for startups to get some feedback from fellow founders. Different communities have different tones, audiences and interests. So be authentic, study the community, and engage with them genuinely.

#### Other Types of Launches

Apart from the ones above, there are also other types of launches such as 'Pre-order Launch', where you use platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo to get pre-orders for a physical product. Then there's the 'Waitlist Launch', where you keep users informed with updates while they wait for your actual product.

However, one thing to note here: Don't count too much on press releases for sustainable growth. They may expose you to early users and investors, but they won't get you to sustained growth. It's better to build your own community during the startup phase.

### The Bottom Line

Think of launching as not just a one-time event. If your first launch doesn't get much attention, that's perfectly okay. Just take a page from Airbnb's book and launch again and again until you do. Always remember, practice makes perfect in the startup world.
