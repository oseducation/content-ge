## Fundraising Myths: I Am Going to Lose Control of My Company 

A common fear I hear from startup owners is the thought of losing control over their company after raising funding. "If I gather funds, I'll have no say in my own company!" is a statement I often hear. But, let's clear that up - nowadays, raising a seed round actually offers founders even more control than in the past. 

This increased control is largely due to a tool called **SAFE** (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). When you fundraise using SAFEs, you don't lose any board seats, meaning no one gets a say in your company's decisions but you and your team! There are no shareholders immediately after closing funds with safes. Investors only get their shares when the next funding round happens, so literally zero shares change hands in this process.

A bonus point - there are no information rights granted in SAFEs. This means you won't have anyone peeking at your financial records or requesting to scrutinize your accounts. _You_ decide when and how to share updates with investors. 

Time for a real-world example! Consider **Zapier**. A decade ago, three creators from Missouri launched this incredibly useful tool that helps different apps communicate with each other. Having a few customers initially, they presented their early product at a YC demo day and raised over a million dollars from angels and small funds. 

The crucial part was they harnessed the power of SAFEs! Raising a bunch of checks allowed them to run their company just the way they desired - embracing a fully remote work model 10 years ago - way before it became the trend.

For the following decade, they just focused on pleasing their customers and took a decision to never raise extra funding. So, those who fear they'll remain indebted to investors, let me tell you, it's not primarily the case. You can run your business the way **you** wish when you use SAFEs to raise your initial funding. Zapier is a prime example as it is a 100-million-dollar revenue business today that only raised funds once! 

And that, my friends, is that power of SAFEs, giving you all the control you need over your startup!
