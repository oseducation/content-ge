## Key Business Model Lessons on Scaling a Startup

Let's review some lessons we can pick up from companies that have managed to grow really big. To make it more interesting let's also determine what types of businesses aren't usually found amongst the top 100 companies.

First up, you won't find many service- or consultant-based enterprises in this top tier. You might wonder why, right? Well, these types of businesses usually deal with one-off sales, which, while valuable for learning about your customers and building the right product, can be a headache to grow significantly. The main issues? Constantly needing new customers - since revenue doesn't reliably repeat - and having to hire more people to serve more clients, leading to less profit per sale.

And what about companies that earn cash by recommending other people's stuff, also known as affiliate marketing? While it may seem like an easy enough gig, the challenge is that they're essentially a middleman, meaning their income is dependent on others' transactions. This setup makes it rather difficult to increase their earnings considerably especially given that they only earn a small cut from each sale and typically receive payment after quite some time.

What's next? Oh, hardware businesses. Though they can sound exciting, they're not exactly an easy bet. It takes a good deal of money to even get started since you have to buy all those physical parts. Then you still deal with tiny profit margins which makes it incredibly hard to start, let alone scale up these businesses.

Lastly, let's see businesses built on other platforms. Now these are tricky. They're like buildings made on rented land. The day the landowner wants to, they can ask you to pack up! In simple terms, if your business is operating on someone else's successful platform and starts doing well, it's in the platform owner's interest to kick your business out and take over all the money-making for themselves.

The bottom line is, that while these business models may work initially, they can run into trouble easily, making them less ideal for achieving a large scale. We should always try to understand the potential roadblocks before starting out, so we make informed decisions and create a more sustainable approach for our business.
