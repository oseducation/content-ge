1. Topic Name: Startups Fundraising: Myths Decoded 
2. Brief Description: This topic discusses a few common misconceptions related to startups and fundraising, focusing on the importance of having a network to raise funds and the relevance of founders talking to investors themselves. It also shares the success story of a company called Podium. 
3. Rewritten Topic:

Let's chat about a couple of tall-tales people often believe about the startup scene, especially when it comes to finding funds. Our first myth is, **"You need fancy connections to raise money"**. But that's not really true! Sure, when you're starting a company, if people know who you are, it's a plus. But more importantly, investors care about your idea and whether it's something people actually want or need. Think about our friends at Podium. They had a simple idea—making software to help tire shops manage their Yelp reviews. These two guys from Utah didn't have big-time Silicon Valley connections but they were ace at sales and had a product people wanted.

By the time they joined Y Combinator, a center for developing startups, they were already making money. And by the end of their time there, they were bringing in big bucks each month. One day, I bumped into them at an alumni event and was amazed at the progress of this little company that was helping tire shops. It wasn't long before investors saw this too. Fast-forward to now, Podium makes a cool $100 million a year and has raised more than $200 million. They didn’t come from high society or have big-time connections. They simply created something people wanted.

While on this subject, I'd like to sidestep a bit and shed light on another thing. If you're looking to raise funds, you might meet people who propose to raise money for you, claiming to have a strong investor network. But keep in mind - it's important for **you** to chat with the investors directly. The relationship between you and your investor matters! So, if someone offers to do the fundraising for you, instead ask them to introduce you to the investor and run the conversation yourself.

Let's finish by busting our last myth...
