## Determining the Value of a Problem for Potential Customers

So, you're ready to make your MVP or **the** simplest form of your product** that you'll show to users. That's great! However, it's vital to ensure that the issue you're trying to fix is really worth fixing. In other words, are people ready to pay for a solution to the problem? Is the problem so important that solving it is valuable? With this, let me take you through three simple ways to figure this out.

### Point 1: Check If There Is Money to Be Made
The first thing you need to do is see if people are already spending money on solutions to the problem. For example, let's say your product can make carbon emissions reports. Are the folks who currently do this job getting paid well? If they are, that's great news! This could mean your solution might also be valued.

### Point 2: Know Your Competitors
Next, find out if people are already happy with the solutions they have. This might sound basic, but it's crucial. Simple tools like Excel or Google spreadsheets can be big competition to many new businesses. If you want to get people to leave these tools, your product needs to be much, much better. No one would want to pay a lot of money for something that can be done almost the same way in Google spreadsheet or Excel.

### Point 3: Understand If Your Product is Easy to Sell 
Finally, think about how easy or hard it is to sell to your audience. In my experience, selling to groups like plumbers or contractors can be quite hard. They don't often change their tools or software. However, startups are always eager to try new things. Even if your product does solve a problem, it's important to think if it's going to be easy to sell it to your audience.

Now, once you have the prototype of your MVP ready, you can start testing and improving it. Remember, the best product is one that not only solves a problem but also is wanted by the customer. This is the key to success in the startup world.
