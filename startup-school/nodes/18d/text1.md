_**The Power of Founders in Driving Startup Growth**_ 

Let's get straight to the point: You, the founders, are the real engines that power your startups. It's your hard work, creativity, and unconventional approach that launches your startup and keeps it soaring.

Does this mean you'll be asked to do things you haven't learnt in business school? Definitely. Sounds a bit scary? A bit, yes. But remember, that's the thrilling journey of entrepreneurship.

Being part of an entrepreneur support program like YC Batch, we're going to be encouraging you to launch. Yes, it's crucial. But what comes after that is equally important - the quest to win users. Here's the tricky part - there isn't a one-size-fits-all way to do this. It's different for every startup. For some, it might mean sales and for others, it could mean doing stuff that won't necessarily be scalable.

You'll probably begin with your friends, then friends of your friends, and then - here comes the important part - reaching out to unfamiliar audiences. That's because, these folks, not linked to you in any way, will give genuine feedback about your startup, something you desperately need.

Don’t expect to launch your website, put up some ads, and expect magic to happen overnight. That's not generally how it works. The initial stages of a startup are rarely about quick wins and more about ground-level hustle. It might seem a daunting task, but to grow when you're tiny, you need to be okay with doing things that don't easily scale. It’s not an easy road, but with grit and persistence, it's a road that can definitely lead to success.
