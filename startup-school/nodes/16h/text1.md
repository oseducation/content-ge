## Understanding Primary and Secondary KPIs in Startups
Alright, let's talk about how to pick the right KPIs for your startup. Remember, we never want to be running fast in the wrong direction. So what are KPIs, and why are they so important?

KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators, are like the 'checkpoints' in your business journey. They help us see if our business is on the right track. 

Let's first talk about **primary KPIs.** This is the main 'checkpoint' you use to see whether your business is moving in the right direction. For most startups, your primary KPI should be **growth**, and even better if it's growth in your **income.** Why? Partly because it tells us that we've built something that people want and that we're on our way to building a big, successful business. 

But there are exceptions, of course. For example, a marketplace business might focus more on sign-ups, while a new business-to-business startup with a long selling process might focus on intended business partnerships.

Now, **secondary KPIs** are supporting 'checkpoints.' While they are not the main focus, they make sure that your primary KPI is really on point. They can also give you a quick warning sign if things start to go wrong. Some good secondary KPI examples are **customer churn and retention rates** (since these contribute to your income growth), **unit economics** (which tells you if you're making money on each user), and **customer acquisition cost** (which can make you lose or make money). 

While it can feel good to boast about things like how many social media followers you have, we call these 'feel-good' numbers **vanity metrics.** They might look pretty, but they don't really tell us anything about the health of our business. So always question if a metric is really helping you grow your income.

A real-life example can be seen in two companies, **DoorDash and Rickshaw**, both starting as delivery platforms. They focused on order volume as their top KPI which cleared the path for well-focused execution and traction. However, due to funding struggles, Rickshaw tried to optimize for both growth and per-order profitability, losing sight of their single primary KPI. In the end, it resulted in slower growth, emphasizing why concentrating on one primary KPI is essential.

So, remember, when you're setting goals for your business, pick your primary KPIs. Keep your focus sharp and don't try to juggle too many critical elements at the same time. Keep secondary KPIs supporting the primary one, and as your business grows, make changes as needed. Don't get distracted and remember, growth is usually a good bet!
