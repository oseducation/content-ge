## Addressing Common Misconceptions about Starting a Startup

Okay, let's have a breather and put a bow on our chat. Can you see a thread running through these myths we've chatted about? There's a huge myth, the one that throws a blanket over all these little beliefs. That myth says, "This startup thing, it's not your cup of tea." All these wrong ideas and mixed-up thoughts that founders carry around, add up. And they may make you think, "Hang on, maybe this startup gig isn't my thing. I don't know how to do this. I don't have a swanky network of influencers and I don't rub shoulders with the well-connected crowd. I'm clueless on how to pitch an idea or dazzle people with my brilliance." 

But listen, here's the truth: You absolutely CAN do this. Raising funds doesn't need to be your first step. You can just get started on building your startup. There isn't a secret code that you have to crack to get your business running. You don't have to wait for anyone's 'go-ahead', least of all an investor's. Plus, who says you need a fancy, choreographed pitch? All that's required is for you to create something people find valuable, and then talk about it just like you do with your friends and family every day. 

Guess what the icing on the cake is? You have something called *safes*- a doodle to understand and use. This makes it super easy for you to raise the money you need, and quickly too. And the terms you’ll strike today mean that you can steer your company in exactly the direction YOU want. There are no secret decoder rings or special ways to run your startup. You are the captain of your ship!

Plus, you don’t need a big network or fancy connections to raise money. Finally, understand that rejection doesn’t mean you’re bad. It doesn’t mean you've messed up, it’s just part of the journey. Believe it or not, there’s never been a better time in human history to raise money than right this moment. So, if you’re tempted to kick-start a startup, don’t hesitate. Get your hands dirty, dive in and get building your dream! You can do this. You absolutely can do this.
