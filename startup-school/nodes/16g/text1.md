## Common Mental Traps in Startup Prioritization

When you're running a startup, it's super easy to get lost in a sea of to-dos. There are some sneaky mental traps that make us focus on tasks that may not actually lead us closer to what we call *'product market fit'*. The aim here is to know these mental traps and try to sidestep them.

Firstly, we have a soft spot for tasks we can quickly tick off our list. These 'low-leverage' tasks might include spending too much time on things like paperwork, setting up legal stuff, or even taking meetings with potential partners. They might give us this sweet sense of achievement, but in reality, they don't contribute much to our ultimate goal of achieving product-market fit.

The second mental block you might face is the 'illusion of success'. You might think your product is working well when it's not really up to scratch. The key is to be straightforward with yourself, recognize your issues, and start repairing them ASAP. Remember, slow growth is NOT the same as finding product-market fit.

Now, onto the third trap - the 'paralysis by perfectionism or indecision'. When things don't seem to go well, each decision might seem like a do-or-die. But, it is essential to remember that not every decision can bring down your business. The key here is to make good decisions promptly, and even if they tend not to be right, learn and rectify them quickly.

The next mental puzzle is 'over-protection'. Essentially, you can spend too much time fixing little issues and not pushing for new, exciting things. Yes, it's easier to fix existing problems, but remember, the real magic happens when you dive in, take risks and get creative. 

Lastly, 'ignoring the elephant in the room' is a huge mistake. You can easily get stuck trying to solve small problems and avoid dealing with bigger ones that pose an existential threat to your startup. 

To sum it all: 
1. Prioritize tasks using critical metrics (KPIs). 
2. Focus on issues that block achieving your primary KPI. 
3. Be honest about your current situation and don't delay failure.

Remember, prioritization is a balancing act, and making sense of what really matters in your startup journey can set you on the path to success.
