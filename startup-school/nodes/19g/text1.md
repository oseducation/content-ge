## The Role of SAFEs in Startup Funding - Asher Bio Example 

Imagine you're launching a startup, let's call it "BlueSky Bio." It's in the biotech field and it's working on a cure for cancer. Usually, companies like this need lots of money right from the start, sometimes millions of dollars. To get that money, founders create a "pitch deck," a short presentation to convince investors their startup is worth funding. 

But imagine instead of having to convince investors to give you millions upfront, there was an easier way. That's just what happened with a real company called Asher Bio. 

When Asher Bio's founders approached Y Combinator (a startup support and funding organization), all they had was an idea. But that idea was enough to get initial investors to provide some money. Instead of seeking millions in upfront funding, they used a tool called "SAFEs" or Simple Agreements for Future Equity.

SAFEs are a creative way to get some initial funding quickly. They allow investors to put money into a company with the promise of getting shares at a later date. For Asher Bio, using SAFEs meant they could raise their first million dollars without having to go through the hassle of a traditional round of funding.

With that first million, Asher Bio was able to speed up their work in the lab. By the time they were ready to talk to bigger investors from the pharmaceutical industry about more substantial funding, they had made significant progress. This put them in a much stronger position.

Ultimately, Asher Bio has raised over $150 million in funding. But it's that first million raised through SAFEs that really changed things. SAFEs were a game-changer. They shifted the balance of power, giving Asher Bio more leverage when talking to investors. The lesson here is that SAFEs can really change how startups approach funding, making the whole process more accessible and less intimidating.
