## Key Pricing Strategies for Startups: Most Startups Are Undercharging

So, let's talk about how startups place a price tag on their products or services. Often, beginners make this common mistake - they underestimate their offerings and charge too low. But it's essential to understand that using low prices as your only way to stand out is not a solid plan. 

Imagine you're competing with a big company. If your product is similar and you're just cheaper, what's stopping them from reducing their prices too? The big guys have more money, and they can afford to keep prices low till you can't compete anymore. So, don't rely on low prices to attract customers. Instead, focus on making your product better or catering to a need your competitors aren't addressing.

A neat little fact to remember is that people often connect your price with the quality of your product. If you're cheaper, they might think your product is of lesser worth. But, if you price higher and deliver on quality, customers will expect and appreciate more value.

Changing your pricing, i.e., raising it for good reasons, can increase your income considerably. Say you have 1000 customers and you want to double your income. Trying to bag another 1000 customers seems like a lot of work, right? But, if you just double your prices (and the quality of offerings matches up), you can achieve that goal faster and easier!

But what if your customers don't want to pay more? If this happens, you might need to check if the perceived value of your product matches the price. Or perhaps, you need to tackle a bigger problem for them, something that they'd be willing to pay more for.

It's okay to go easy on pricing in a few cases though. For example, your first few customers might pay less but can give you valuable feedback. Or if a well-recognized company becomes your client, their stamp of approval helps draw in more customers. If your product has future value, like 'locking in' the customers, you may offer an initial lower price. Moreover, if you're able to renew contracts with a bump in price, this could be a viable strategy to lure in customers.

Remember: pricing your product right is key to startup success. Be sure not to undersell your worth!
