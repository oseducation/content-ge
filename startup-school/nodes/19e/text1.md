## Fundraising Myths: Raising Money Is Complicated, Slow, and Expensive

Alright folks, let me make a point to clear up a misunderstanding about raising funds for a startup. You often might think it's a complex, slow, and expensive process owing to the big numbers you see in news articles about companies raising massive amounts from renowned venture capitalists.

So, why does this view exist? Just glance at tech news. Companies like Shopify, Mark Vision, Locket-Sprague are spoken about, and the common factor they all share is the huge fundraising numbers. But, what if you're a budding entrepreneur thinking, "I just need $25,000 to quit my regular job and concentrate on my startup"? You might start thinking this whole fundraising business isn't for you.

Here's the fun fact, though: What you typically see in big news headlines are Series A and growth round funds â€” stages where companies usually raise anywhere from $10M to $50M that take months to close and enormous legal fees. These stages whoop up the glamour in the business!

What you don't often hear about are the initial seed round funds. There's not much glamour here; it's a bit bland, a bit boring even. Most companies start by raising a seed round, typically much smaller in size like $500,000 to a couple of million dollars. These rounds can be closed in weeks if not days! And the best part? They usually don't involve big legal fees.

And that's the truth for you folks! If you're trying to raise pre-seed funds or just $50,000 from friends and family, it's doable pretty quickly, and you rarely require a lawyer. So do not be intimidated by the ginormous figures in news headlines. There's a different reality for startups at different stages, and there's definitely a starting point for everyone.
