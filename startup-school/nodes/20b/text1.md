3. Topic Rethink:

Let me share with you why jumping in and giving something like Y Combinator (let's call it YC for short!) a shot is worth it. But first, let's chat about something a little funny - **luck**. I've talked about it before, and guess what? A lot of people who got into YC say that talk was really helpful. So, let's revisit it. 

You might have heard people say some folks are just more **lucky**. But do you know luck isn't just something that falls into your lap while you're sitting on your sofa? It requires action. You can make your own luck, becoming the lucky person you wish to be. How? By stepping out into the world, by taking risks. 

Consider luck as a fun game where good, exciting things can happen, but only if you're playing. If you avoid situations because you're scared of being turned down - like not applying to YC - you're restricting the chances of getting lucky. In my book, this piece of advice stands true no matter what your end goal is: searching for a startup idea, learning sales, or hunting for top-notch employees. 

The key is you ---- stepping out, taking risks, trying different things. The more you work on this 'luck building' skill, the better. And guess what? Just deciding to apply to YC could be your very first step to sparking that good luck!
