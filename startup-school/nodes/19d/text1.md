1. Name of the Topic: "Raising Capital for Startups: Dispel The Myths"

2. Very, very small description of topic: The topic talks about the misconceptions that startup founders often have while fundraising, emphasizing that startups don't necessarily need to impress investors but rather convince them about the potential of their ideas.

3. Rewrite this in simpler words:

Hey there you future startup mastermind, let's crack open a big myth about raising money for your business. There's this notion floating around that has lots of folks believing they need to put on a glamourous show to sweep investors off their feet. But guess what, that's not the truth! In reality, you don't need to put up an impressive spectacle for investors. Your goal is to convince them about your business, not impress them.

I mean, consider the biggest startups today. When they began, their ideas probably sounded crazy. 'Airbnb' was basically "Hey, sleep on a stranger's airbed for a night," and 'Doordash' was a delivery service for areas where delivery was hard. 'OpenSea' was creating an online marketplace for digital collectibles (sounds like science fiction right?). But here comes the interesting part; investors understand this. They know that truly groundbreaking ideas often don’t sound like the next big thing at their infancy. Investors are smart cookies - they’re not easy to dazzle with grand words and flashy decks. What they want is honest conversation about the business you're tending to.

Let me share a personal nugget from my past. Years ago, I met Michael Moritz, then a partner at Sequoia Capital. I was armed with a polished deck and well-rehearsed lines to impress him. But instead, he just wanted to chat about the business we were building. That was a valuable lesson! Instead of wining and dining investors with fancy presentations, simply focus on creating something people will want or need.

Occasionally, as a startup maestro, I’ll get asked something like "What are the magic words to get investors onboard?” Honestly, there are no magic words. Your goal should be to build a product, prove that it has value for its users, and explain clearly and simply, how there's even just a 1% chance that your business could be a big deal later. Make sure your product is good enough! If you are not getting investments, it's probably not because you failed to use the right words. It might be that your startup needs more work. 

Take the example of Retool, a business that nailed their fundraising by just being honest and human. The founder, David, would meet investors not with a big fancy pitch deck, but just his laptop. He would demo his product, tell stories about its utility for customers and how it could be valuable. No razzle-dazzle, just honest sharing with eager ears. Today, Retool is valued at FOUR billion dollars! 

So let's shake off the myth that startups need to be glamorous to secure funding. It's all about value, potential, and communicating that effectively. Looking fancy sure doesn’t hurt, but that’s not what you should be investing your time, effort, and early-stage capital on.
