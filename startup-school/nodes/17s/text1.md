## Key Pricing Insights for Startups

I believe everyone can learn a thing or two on how to create a company that's valued at over three billion dollars. So, let's discuss the five central messages regarding pricing. 

Firstly, **charge for your product or service**. It may seem simple, but it's very important. 

Second, your pricing strategy should be based more on **value** and less on pure costs. It's the value of what you're offering, and how much it benefits your customers, that really matters.

Third, a lot of fresh businesses are not asking for enough money for their products or services - you might be doing the same as well. In other words, many new companies tend to **underprice** their offerings.

Fourth, remember, that your initial price **doesn't have to stay forever**. You don't need to be scared about setting the perfect price from the onset. Your pricing can be adjusted as you learn more about your market and as you make your product better.

Lastly, it's best to **keep pricing structures simple**. No one likes confusion, especially where money is concerned! The easier it is for customers to understand your pricing, the easier it will be for them to pay you.
