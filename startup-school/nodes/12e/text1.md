## Examples of Good and Bad Interview Questions

When starting a business, asking questions to the right people can be very important. But it's not always easy to change someone's behavior, so it'll be helpful if you know the right way to ask questions. Learn to ask follow-up questions too because it can be hard to get all the information you need from just one question.

To get more information, here are some follow-up questions you might use: 'What do you mean by that?', 'Can you tell me more about that?', or 'Why is that important to you?'

However, there are also types of questions you should avoid asking. These ones can sometimes put the conversation off-track:

1. **'Will you use our product?'** - People might say yes, but it may not mean anything to you. They might just be trying to be nice.

2. **'Which features would make Product X better?'** - Remember, it's your job to figure out what features would solve their problems, not theirs.

3. **Yes/no questions** - These types of questions don't really add a lot to the conversation. They don't provide you with concrete examples or real, useful information.

4. **'How would a better Product X look to you?'** - Most people you'll be talking to are not product developers, software engineers, designers, etc. That's not their job. Their job is to do something else and your job is to understand what is difficult about their job.

5. **Double-barreled questions** - Asking two questions at once can confuse people and mix up their answers.

Remember not to be too eager to get all the answers at once. Take one step at a time and build a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve.
