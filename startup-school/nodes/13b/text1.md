## Talk to users before writing code

Coming up with ideas or finding problems that need solving is a vital part of creating your startup. Here's a little advice on how you can go about it: 

**Speak to potential users before creating your MVP** - This doesn't mean you have to plunge into a three-year research project or gain 10 years of industry experience. Sometimes, just having a few conversations with potential users can give you a lot of insight. The closer you are to your user, the better. Ideally, you should be solving a problem that you, yourself, have experience with. It makes it much easier to gauge if your product is really solving the problem it intends to.

A frequent question I run into is - "**How do I find my first users?**". This question always leaves me a little puzzled. Theoretically, you should already have someone in mind, someone who has the problem your product aims to solve. Your first user could be this individual. If that person happens to be you, all the better! 

However, if you find yourself creating a product for a "mysterious" group of users, whose needs and wants you don't understand... well, it might be time for you to take a step back and reconsider. It's absolutely essential to know and understand your users for your startup to succeed. So get out there and start having those conversations!
