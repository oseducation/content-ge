## Very Rarely Will You Need a Heavy MVP

Let's talk about starting a business in areas that are heavily regulated, like insurance, banking, or even tech-centered fields such as drone technology. It can indeed be more **difficult to get started** in these areas. 

Sometimes you might even be involved in very complex fields, maybe you are trying to build rockets or invent new drugs. These types of businesses, often called 'moonshot' projects, are tough. They're not the kind of things you can easily set up in a few weeks. For example, can you imagine trying to bore tunnels into the earth and replace cars with high-speed vehicles in just a couple of weeks? 

If you find yourself in these situations, **here's a helpful tip:** you can begin with a basic website. This website can simply explain what you do. It's a great starting point, and having a place where people can get information about your business is extremely valuable.

Building a simple website like this **can be done in days, not weeks**. In a strange and unexpected way, starting off with a 'heavier' Minimum Viable Product (MVP) like a detailed website could potentially be faster than starting with a 'lean' MVP.

Remember: Your journey in starting your business may be more challenging due to the intricacies and regulations of certain industries, but it's not impossible. And this simple tip regarding your starting point can make a remarkable difference.
