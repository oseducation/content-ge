## Maintaining Connection with Interviewees

Every great startup starts with an idea. But how do you know if this idea will work? How do you make sure that it will meet people's needs? The key to throwing light on these questions is through interviews or `user testing sessions`.

After you have gathered a lot of useful opinions and ideas through these interviews, it's wise to keep your fellow members involved in your journey. Many successful startups do this in a very clever way, by inviting their users to join private groups, often on platforms like `Slack` or `WhatsApp`.

Now, isn't it a lovely feeling to be part of something special? You bet it is! More so if this 'something special' is a product that could change the world in time to come. When inviting people into these groups, ensure to make them feel unique, to make them feel part of your 'future-changer' product journey.

As your product grows and changes, keep members of these groups in the loop. Show them your work, talk to them about the progress, and make them feel special like they are the first ones to see this. This kind of openness not only makes them feel connected but also builds trust, as they can see you're acting on their feedback.

It's important to note that some people enjoy meeting others with similar thoughts. Creating these spaces lets them connect, which can be a rare opportunity for many. It's you who can make this happen!

If you follow these steps, you will draw invaluable insight from your potential users. Keeping them involved will help you translate this feedback into your first `prototype` or `Minimum Viable Product (MVP)`. 

So, to wrap things up, the secret to the road to a successful startup lies in understanding your users, involving them in the journey, and acting on their pointers in building your product.
