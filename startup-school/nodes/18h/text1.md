## Startup Growth Channels
  
Have you got an idea that people like? Great! Now, let's talk about how you can sprout from a seedling idea into a mighty oak of a startup by exploring different growth channels.

Firstly, imagine your idea is for something unusual. Think rare enough that people wouldn't do it every day, like skydiving or building a spaceship. In such cases, folks would usually turn to Google to know more about it. Hence, if your startup is about something rare, you should consider being visible on Google. You can achieve this either by paying for ads or optimizing your website for search engines (a strategy known as SEO), which is the fancy way of saying "making sure Google likes your website".

Now, let's think about something more common: products or services that people love to talk about to their friends. Services like Uber or Airbnb started off like thisâ€”people couldn't stop chatting about them. If your offering gets people talking, then you should capitalize on this by focusing on **virality** and _referrals_. Put simply, virality is when people readily share your product with others because they like it, and referrals involve incentivizing them to do so by giving rewards.

Also, keep in mind that some products get even better as more people use them. This is particularly true for social networks and marketplaces like Facebook and Airbnb. The more users these platforms have, the better the experience. This is another type of virality. If you have an idea that follows this rule, you should create a welcoming environment for new users and also encourage them to bring their friends along.

If you're targeting a specific group of customers, don't be afraid to do some good ol' direct sales. You can compile a list of potential customers and reach out to them yourself. This personalized approach can yield great results.

Lastly, let's talk about paid online advertising. This has gotten more important in recent years. Startups are now making more money, and hence they can afford to invest in ads. Keep in mind though, you should only consider it if your product is bringing in enough money to justify the expense. Startups sometimes make the mistake of getting lost in the world of online marketing before their product is even ready.

Interestingly, successful companies don't usually use all of these channels. They generally focus on one or two that work best for them. For instance, TripAdvisor primarily uses SEO. Therefore, don't try to do everything at once, pick one or two channels that best align with your startup and focus on them.
