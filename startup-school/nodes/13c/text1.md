## Goals of a Pre-Launch Startup
Let's begin with the goals of a pre-launch startup

**step one: launch quickly**. This mantra has been a cornerstone for successful startups for many years. If you take away anything from our time together today, let it be this: *launch something, even if it's not perfect, and do it as fast as you can*. Trust me, I could talk all day about this concept and it will circle back to this key point.

**The second step is to find your first customers**. You don't need to have your whole customer journey plotted out just yet, but you do need someone using your product. Alarmingly, many budding entrepreneurs' journeys end before a single person has ever interacted with their product. Don't let that be you. Any interaction can bring valuable insights.

Next, **have conversations with your users**. After launching your bare-bones version of your product, it's crucial to listen to your early users. Some entrepreneurs mistakenly believe that feedback at this stage is pointless because the product isn't fully developed. The truth is, that flexibility is key at this stage. You might find that the grand vision you had isn't exactly what your customers need or want. As the saying goes, hold onto the problem and customer tightly, but hold your solution loosely.

Lastly, **continue to make changes - or 'iterate'**. It’s easy to fall in love with the first thing you build and become blinded by its shortcomings. Resist the temptation to toss it aside and try solving different problems when the going gets tough. Stick with your original user and problem. For example, if you’ve built a screwdriver and it doesn’t work well for a mechanic who needs a screwdriver, don’t start thinking about how it could be a spatula or a brush. Instead, figure out how to make it a better screwdriver.

Remember, the path to success is all about sticking with your user and their problem, and continually refining your solution until it works impeccably well.
