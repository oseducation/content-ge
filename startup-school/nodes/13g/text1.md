## Launching a Startup Is Not Special

Let's break down a common myth among those looking to kick-start their business. A lot of people see big companies make flashy product launches and think, "That's what we should do!" But let's have a hearty chat about this.

Think about companies like Facebook. They're well-known, they make headlines, and their launches seem incredibly exciting. Seeing this might make you think, "That's what success looks like!" But let's look a bit closer.

Consider this - do any of you remember the exact day Google, Facebook, or even Twitter launched? Not really, right? This tells us, that launches, in themselves, don't make or break a company. What gives life to your business isn't a one-time, grand launch event. It's something more crucial - your customers!

Let's start using simpler terms. When we say 'launch', let's think of it as the time you start getting customers. And let's call a big, flashy, media-covered event a 'press launch'. Your main focus, especially in the early stages, should be on acquiring customers, not making headlines.

You might learn a lot about your customers through research, but nothing beats giving them a real product. Until they've touched, used, and reviewed what you're offering, you can't confidently say that it meets their needs. This is also a fast check to know if your product does not solve their problems. 

So here's our main takeaway â€“ spending your time building something for your customers is far more valuable than perfecting a grand pitch deck or working endlessly for a grandiose press launch. Feel free to blur the glamour of press coverage and direct your energy where it matters customer. 

Be eager to learn from your customers. After all, they are the heart of your business!
