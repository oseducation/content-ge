## Utilizing 'X for Y' Pitches Appropriately

Often, when trying to share what your startup does, you might be tempted to use the popular 'X for Y' pattern - you know, like "Uber for X" or "Airbnb for Y". Questions come up, "Is it too common? should I go for it?" Let's dig in to find the answer. 

So, let's make one thing clear. Each of you must have a simple and crisp one-line description for your startup, which does not rely on the ‘X for Y’ format. However, there are cases where the ‘X for Y’ approach can be a good choice. 

For example, we can consider Paisy, who was part of our earlier YC batch. They might denote themselves as "Stripe for previous Soviet Union countries". Yet, they could also be described as "payment processing for former Soviet countries". Do you see the difference?

And when is it alright to use the 'X for Y' style? Well, let's go back to Paisy. If the founders are talking to folks in Silicon Valley like investors or the press, a familiar comparison may make sense. You can opt for the 'X for Y' concept if it's indeed the best way to give a clear picture of your startup in a jiffy.

**But wait!** To use this method, you must meet these three rules. 

- Firstly, X should be a widely known brand.
- Secondly, it must be pretty clear why Y wants what X offers.
- Lastly, Y should represent a large market.

For instance, a YC startup once presented itself as "Buffer for Snapchat". The problem here was that although Buffer is doing well, not everyone is aware of it. I remember having to search online for what Buffer was. So, in such cases, it's best to simply describe the problem that your startup is trying to solve.

An example from the startup school community that works is "Harkalive is Airbnb for dance and movement classes". It gives a quick understanding of what Harkalive does. But as easily, you could say "Harkalive is a marketplace for dance and movement classes”.

**So, in summary,** the best one-liners do these:

- They tell what you do, the problem you're solving, and for whom you're doing it.
- They are simple and don't use complex words or salesy language.
- They don’t have a long setup and are short and sweet.

Now that you have these points, you are better equipped to create a snappy one-liner that clearly defines your startup. Go on and make your startup easier to understand!
