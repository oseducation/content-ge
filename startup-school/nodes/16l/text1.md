## Understanding Exceptions to Revenue KPIs in Startups

Let's have a little chat about certain exceptions to the usual ways of keeping track of a startup's success, or what we often call 'revenue Key Performance Indicators' (KPIs). These exceptions mainly apply to special types of businesses like those that make physical stuff (hardware companies), work in the field of biology and technology (biotech companies), or large businesses that take a lot of time to sell their products or services (enterprises with long sales cycles). 

In such businesses, figuring out whether you're growing can be a bit tough. Instead of looking at money coming in, you might have to consider things like 'letters of intent' (kind of promises that someone might buy your product), contracts, or even technical achievements (we call them technical milestones) as signs of progress.

However, it's super important that you remain straightforward and truthful to yourself. Make sure these signs are not just fancy numbers or achievements but are truly showing that you are moving forward and growing. You might need to recheck them quite often to keep things clear and honest.

So, here's a little challenge for each one of you: Don't just settle for typical success measures. Take time to really understand your business and find your own signs of progress and growth. It might be a bit tricky, but remember, the path to success always requires some smart navigation.
