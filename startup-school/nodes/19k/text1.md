## Fundraising Myths: If Investors Reject My Startup It is a Bad Startup

Alright, let's dive into the last little story I have for you today. It's a common belief that if an investor says 'no' to your startup, it means your idea is not good. But let me tell you, that's not true. Even if you've got a win-worthy product or if your startup is gaining a speedy pickup, you might still hear a 'no' from investors. And guess what? It's totally fine!

Have you ever heard about the startup called **Envision**? Envision was a healthcare startup, focusing on detecting cancer. A woman named Serbia leads this company and is now a top member of the YC group. When Serbia started building Envision, it was tough for her to get that very first investor. Imagine this: she faced more than 50 'no's before she got a 'yes'.

So what made that first 'yes' possible? She made a brave move. Serbia promised she wouldn't take any salary for two years if the investor would bet on her. And this was all for a humble deal - a $25,000 investment.

Her first funding round brought in half a million dollars. Yes, it was not an easy journey. 'No's were everywhere. But she didn't stop. And you know what happened next? This fantastic healthcare startup, which had to face countless 'no's, was bought for a massive $275 million.

So, remember, even a brilliant startup like Envision had to go through a lot of rejections. It doesn't mean your startup is not good enough. So keep going!
