## Fundraising Myths: Raising Money Is Glamorous

Alright, let's jump into some popular myths about raising funds for your fresh startup. The first one that is widely misunderstood is that fundraising is all glitter and glamour. What do you picture when you think about startups gathering funds? Many of you might have an image inspired by the television show - Shark Tank. That's a place where business people get all dressed up, put together a flashy presentation, and pitch their ideas to a panel of investors, or as they're called - 'sharks'. 

These investors, having varying expertise, ask many probing questions before throwing out offers. It's natural to think, “Wow, I need to prepare an intense presentation!” This is associated with high-pressure and tough questions. But don't let that make you anxious. 

Here's the truth: the actual process of raising startup money resembles something much more mundane - coffee chats. It's usually just folks sitting around, engaging in calm, one-on-one discussions. Things like Shark Tank are primarily for show, acting as marketing events for the bodies that organize them. Most investors present at such occasions might not be there to invest at all, they're likely lurking to meet other investors. Even Mark Cuban from Shark Tank mentions that he hasn't seen any profit yet, although he has invested $20 million. Real fundraising involves repetitive one-on-one meetings, usually on Zoom, wherein you work to collect checks and win investors over. It's all about the grind.

The chart from a real-life startup, Fresh Paint, clearly shows the tough journey they underwent to secure their funding. Each shape represents a different investor that they met, where the connecting shapes indicate that an introduction was made by that investor. They spoke to 160 investors, with 39 saying yes - quite a high success rate! But, the investment amounts varied a lot, with checks written from as little as $5k up to $200k. The whole ordeal took a little over four months to conclude all meetings and solidify deals, ultimately raising $1.6 million. It was definitely a grind, but the process boiled down to good old, straightforward, conversations. Their journey provides a genuine insight into what fundraising really looks like. So, remember - it's less about the glitz, more about the grit.
