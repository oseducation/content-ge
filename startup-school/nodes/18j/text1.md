## Effective Use of Paid Growth for Startups

Alright my friends, let's dive into an exciting subject today - **Paid Growth for your Startup**. You know, things like grabbing new customers through referrals, dominating search engine results (SEO), or running paid ads. Each one of these could fill an hour-long chat, but let's just give a brief overview here.

Here's the deal: if your startup has found a good product-market fit, and you're ready to grow, you'll likely choose one of these methods. And let me warn you, it's going to take lots and lots of elbow grease. So, ready to dive head-first into it? Great! There are plenty of resources out there to help you master these methods, but there's a trick to it. You don't have to be an ace in every method. Why? Because your startup might not need all of them.

A key rule in paid growth, especially with online marketing: is don't jump into it without having some income from your business. It's a common slip-up I've seen many founders make. They start buying ads for products without seeing if they can recover the cost. Avoid this!

So, what's the next step you ask? This brings us to a crucial term: **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**. In straightforward words, it's the money you shell out to get a new customer. Google Facebook, and other popular ad tools, can help you determine this. The significant thing here is to make sure your earnings from this new customer are greater than your CAC. If not, you're running in red.

The million-dollar question - how do we figure out if we're succeeding? You might think, "Looks like it'll work, but not in month one, perhaps by month eight." But here's the caution: you can't risk your cash on something uncertain. Either wait it out eight months or look for early signs that your earnings are going to exceed your CAC.

A smart move for startups? Don't wait for eight months. Set a lower CAC target, perhaps looking at earnings from the first one to three months. 

Lastly, where should you concentrate on getting seen? The big players these days? Google, Facebook, and Instagram. 

These insights should give you a decent start in this world of paid growth. Remember, it's all about putting in the smart work and making sure your earnings outpace your costs. As always, happy growing!
