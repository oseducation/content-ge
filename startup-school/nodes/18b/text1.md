## Doing Things That Don't Scale in Early-Stage Startups

I've got an interesting piece for you to check out— it's about the early steps taken in a startup journey. Now, don't shy away from the complexity. It's a fascinating read by Paul Graham and it's titled "Doing Things That Don't Scale". The story of Airbnb in its infancy is explored in this article, and there's a lot we can learn from it!

As someone looking to start your own business, you'll need to juggle two skill sets as time goes on. In the initial stages, you'll find yourself doing stuff you never imagined doing, things that might seem weird or unnatural. These actions might be far from what you learned at past jobs or even at school. They're hands-on tasks that might not be useful in the bigger picture. 

But guess what? That's just how things are at the start, and that's perfectly okay. 

As your company grows, your tasks will change. You'll start focusing more on areas that are foundational like software development, or things that can help your company grow even bigger— essentially, you'd be doing tasks that scale.

So, here's a simple way to put it: You need to be okay with doing 'offbeat' things at first, and later transition to 'large-scale' tasks.

At our New York City meetings, we often advise newly launched companies— to embrace doing things that don't scale initially. Many people, especially those with business degrees, find this concept a little hard to accept. They might think, "Why would I do anything that won't yield long-term results?" or "This doesn’t seem like a strategy." But that's where everyone needs to start.

There's a common belief that we should only focus on 'big picture' goals or tasks that are scalable. Now, as a startup founder, you need to forget that notion temporarily. At the start of your entrepreneurial journey, your priority should be tackling tasks, big or small, that might not scale— and that's perfectly fine. As you grow and your company grows, the tasks will naturally start to scale too. 

So remember, being comfortable with doing things that don't seem to scale initially is a part of your startup voyage. And who knows? Your 'weird' ideas might end up becoming the next big thing! Keep going!
