## Importance of Sales Skills for Startup Founders

Alright, let's chat about an essential skill for startup founders: selling. Being good in sales isn't just about selling your product or service, it's also about knowing your customer inside and out. That's because understanding your customer and selling are like two sides of the same very valuable coin. 

Think about it, if you don't get what your customer wants or needs (their problem), how can you sell something that can help them (your solution)? 

The second big reason for learning how to sell is simple, it gives you power over your startup's future. Just like you don't let other people make your product or run your services, you shouldn't leave selling to others. Selling should be baked right into your DNA - it should be very much part of what you do every day.

Never sold anything before? No worries. Believe it or not, it's probably the easiest job to learn in a startup. All you need to know is your product, your market, and the problems you're solving. That's it. You become an expert in no time in the eyes of your customers. And when you talk about your product like the solution to a big problem they have, they will want to listen to you.

One of the secrets: Your love and passion for solving your customer's problem can be contagious. If you passionately believe in your product or service, your customers will too. 

Still in doubt? Here are some real-life examples: Tony (DoorDash), Mathilde (Front), Tracy (PlanGrid), and the great Steve Jobs. They were startup founders who mastered sales and thrived.

In summary, before you even think about hiring a sales team, you should know what it's like to walk in their shoes. By getting involved in sales, you discover what makes a good salesperson and if your product is really as good as you think it is. Trust me, get good at sales, and you're on your way to startup success.
