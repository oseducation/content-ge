## Hacks for Quickly Building an MVP

Firstly, we're talking about building an **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product), a baby version of your product. It has enough features to satisfy the early users, and you can use the feedback to shape your complete product later on. Our main goal is to build an MVP *fast*. So, here are some friendly tips on how you can achieve that.

1. **Time-box your spec**

   What I mean is, draw a time limit for this list of stuff you need to build before you're ready to show your product to the world. Say you decide, "I want to launch in three weeks." Then, the things on your list should only be those you can build within three weeks. This makes everything simpler. It helps you scratch off features you can't build in three weeks.

2. **Write your spec**

   This might seem too basic, but trust me, a lot of folks mess this one up. It's very easy to drift from what you're working on because you've not written it down. If you have it in black and white, it helps you stay focused. If you're changing things, you'll at least know it.

3. **Cut your spec**

   A week into your work, you might see you've been a little too ambitious with your spec. You can't possibly finish in time. That's okay. Start cutting out stuff that isn't crucial. If everything seems important, start cutting important things too. Remember, the goal is to put *something* out there.

4. **Don't fall head over heels with your MVP**

   It's easy to get very attached to this first version you're creating. But remember, none of those popular products started as we see them now. Your MVP is just step one. Think of it like a paper you wrote in the first grade - you wouldn't frame that, would you? So, don't get too attached; it's all part of a journey.

Well, that's it for this talk. Always here for any questions you might have. Let's continue creating great things together!
