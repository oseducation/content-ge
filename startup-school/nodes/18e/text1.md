Alrighty! Today, we're going to talk about something you might have heard quite often in startup circles - product-market fit. Many find it hard to measure and understand clearly which often leads to false beliefs of having achieved it. Sounds familiar? No worries, let's break it down.

At the very core, product-market fit means you have created a product that people actually want. It's like saying, "I made something great, so now I've got product-market fit." We need to learn how to measure it and understand when we've hit the mark. 

**The best way to measure Product-Market Fit? Data!** Unbiased data is the key here! Here are a couple of steps you can consider:
1. **Identify your key metric**: This is the data point that best represents the value your company provides. For example, for a startup school, the key metric could be the number of people attending the video talks.
2. **Understand the frequency**: How often does the metric come into play? In our startup school example, it's weekly.

Think of Airbnb. The key metric isn't the number of searches, but the number of bookings and stays. How often do people usually do this? Most travel isn't monthly, but annual. So we look at bookings annually for a measure of retention for Airbnb.

Likewise, for Instagram, the key usage is not posting photos (though some people do), but coming back to the app and viewing photos. This happens usually on a daily basis.

When measuring product-market fit, imagine a graph. One axis represents your key metric and the other represents the time frame. Each time period measures a percentage of people aligned with your key metric. 

Tracking consistency in using your product is crucial for understanding product-market fit. Users' actions speak louder than their words. If they keep returning to you with happiness, you probably have a good product on your hands. 

**Product usage over time** can be plotted on a graph to give you a visual clue about product-market fit. If you see fewer people using your product week after week, that's a red flag. But if most people stick around, you are probably on the right track.

**Remember, investors care about repetitive usage or retention**. They want to see that users love your product enough to keep using it. 

There are, however, some deceptive metrics that you should steer clear from. Total registered users or visitors don't say anything about users loving your product or product-market fit. Also, boasting about conversion rates doesn't mean much unless you know the quality of the people you are converting. And remember, just because you're giving something away for free doesn't mean you've hit a product-market fit. If people only love your product because it's free, you're in for a rude awakening when it's time to start charging.

In conclusion, **retention or repeat usage is the best way to measure product-market fit**. This gives an unbiased view of whether your users love your product enough to keep using it.
