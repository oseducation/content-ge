It shows whether users genuinely value the product enough to continue using it, indicating its true alignment with their needs and preferences. This metric provides a more accurate depiction of product-market fit than more superficial measures such as total registered users or conversion rates, which can be misleading and don't necessarily reflect an affinity for the product."

Retention rates accurately reflect how much users value the product over time by measuring how often they return or keep using the product. This metric offers insight into genuine product engagement and satisfaction, distinguishing it from metrics that may not fully capture users' true commitment or interest in the product."
