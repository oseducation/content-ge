## Produce Lean MVP

The key idea I want you to understand is this: Your startup's first product does not have to be perfect. What it should do, above all else, is to address a real problem.

Your MVP is a very simple version of your product that you can build quickly, often within a few weeks. It can be as basic as a website landing page and a spreadsheet.

Whether your MVP involves software or not, the important thing is to start. Make your MVP very simple, focusing on only a few main things your first users really need. You may want to solve every problem for every user right away, but it's usually smarter to start by addressing a few key issues for a small group of first users. Then, you can add more features later.

Your MVP is your starting point â€“ it's never the end goal. It's just a base for you to grow from. Don't worry if it seems too simple or not as special as you want. What matters is that it solves a problem and allows you to get started.
