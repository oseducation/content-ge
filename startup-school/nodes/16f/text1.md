## Prioritizing tasks and avoiding 'fake progress' in early-stage startups

Let's talk about how to **fast-track your good ideas** and stay clear from the things that only seem like progress but in reality, they aren't - let's call these 'fake progress'. This chat largely applies to early-stage startups, the ones at their beginning steps, and let's say, it caters to the usual, 9 out of 10 cases.

Think about the chores you should have on your to-do list as a startup. At top priority, you should be **chatting with your users**. The more you know about their wants, the better you are at giving them what they crave. Listen to them, and respond to their needs and concerns - this is an immediate path to expanding your business. Build and improve your service/product based on direct feedback from your users. There isn't much else that's as important for your growth at this early stage.

Now, let's talk about 'fake progress', the stuff that *shouldn't* be hogging your time or energy. Things like too many casual chats about funding or attending loads of conferences (unless you are in a very particular field where this is vital). Also, don't burn too much time on fine-tuning technical measures or adding something like an Android app unless your users signal it's a must. 

This 'fake progress' list isn't meant to make you blush. Smart folks can easily be distracted by these tasks - you're in good company and it's never too late to refocus. What's tricky about 'fake progress' tasks is that they can give you a wonderful feeling of achievement, pump up your pride, or give you something swell to boast about on social media. They might even make your mother beam or your ex-partner green with envy!

However, they won't bring you the one thing you are after - fitting your product perfectly to the market needs. It's important to understand the difference and spend your time wisely!
