3. **Topic Rewrite:**

Hello there, budding entrepreneurs! Today's lesson is about developing trust as a leader in **your future startup**. Now, why are we talking about trust? Well, trust is like a valuable gem that shows what kind of a leader you are. It's something that will define your relationship with everyone involved in your business. This includes your employees, your clients, your partners - you name it!

Think of trust like a score or grade for leaders. When people trust you, your score goes up! Building this score is both a fine art and a science project.

Let's focus on the *science* first. It's pretty straightforward. Imagine you're at school and have some math problems to solve. If you consistently get the right answers, people will trust your math skills, won't they? Same with business: if you correctly predict what product to build or whom to sell to, people will trust you more. But if you keep getting it wrong, then unfortunately, your trust score will drop.

Most startup founders, luckily, become pretty good at the science part. But there is another side of the coin, a more subtle and challenging part - the **art** of building trust. This is where you need to show understanding and good judgment. It's about caring for others and not just focusing on yourself. This part requires practice and sensitivity, as it's not as clear-cut as getting a math sum right but that's what makes it an art, isn't it?

As you step out on your journey from baby-stage startups to big-league ones, always remember to build trust. You'll face tough decisions in the future â€“ from letting go of staff, admitting mistakes to customers, to disagreeing with other people's ideas. During these hard times, see each challenge as a chance to up your trust score.

So, your takeaway from today is to always ask yourself: "Which option will make people trust me more as a leader?" And, always choose the path that'll boost your trust score. 

Let trust be your guiding light, and see how it lights your path to success. Happy startup journey to you!
