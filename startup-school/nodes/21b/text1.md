Hi there! Let's talk about a vital aptitude you need if you want to be an ace leader— clear and effective communication. Imagine this: you are the leader of a group and you want your team to follow your lead. To do that, you need to sketch a vivid and attractive picture of the future you're asking them to work towards. Does that make sense?

As your team or company grows, more diverse individuals join the team. They all need to understand your vision. Therefore, your communications need to level up! Going from one-on-one chats to messages that reach everyone— that's the thrill of running a growing group or company.

Now, here's the big secret: effective communication is simple. Yet, making it simple isn’t that easy. To put it plainly, it needs some sweat and elbow grease in terms of time and preparation. You know, it's kind of like the time when former U.S President, Woodrow Wilson was asked about preparing a speech. He said if it's a short 10-minute speech, he'd need two weeks to prep. But if he was told to speak for as long as he wants, he doesn't need any prep at all. That's how critical preparation and planning is if you want to stick to simplicity in your communication— something that's straightforward and easy to remember.

Let me also tell you about another real-life example, this time from Jeff Bezos of Amazon. When he was questioned about Amazon's retail plan, he had it all sorted out plainly: Customers will always want things cheaper, a larger array of stuff to choose from, and faster delivery. These super straightforward 3 principles became Amazon's firm pillars for 20 long years. And guess what? That simplicity itself was what drove the company's plan all this time. Unique, isn’t it? 

Well, talking with such simplicity and clarity is like a sport— you might be naturally good at it, but practice can always make you better. I believe this stands true whether you are in a small 2-4 member startup or a big one. A helpful way to get better is, firstly, to understand that a clear mind leads to clear words.

And yes, set aside some time to put your thoughts on paper. As your thoughts become sharper, your words will too. If you're sharing your thoughts with a large team, take a moment to plan and prepare. Even better, consider practicing your talk in front of a smaller group first to hone it. And don't be shy to ask for feedback. These tools will help you communicate better.

Remember, this ability to communicate clearly is such a core skill in leadership— and there's no better day than today to start working on it. Happy leading!
