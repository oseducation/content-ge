## Key Pricing Strategies for Startups: Keep It Simple
Alright, so today's subject is all about the importance of keeping things simple, specifically when it comes to **pricing** your product or service.

Imagine you're visiting a website to buy a product. You're all set to make a purchase, but then you land on a page that is so complex that you can't figure out what to do. Talk about a mood killer, right? That's what we don't want for our customers. 

Let's take Quicken's pricing page for example. It's like a puzzle with five different purchase buttons and prices ranging from $349 to $899. To make matters more complicated, there are crossed-out prices and discount symbols scattered throughout. Excited to buy? Not so much. This kind of pricing design could definitely make customers think twice before buying and lead to lower sales.

So, how do we avoid this? 

Keep it straightforward! Our goal is to make the buying process as smooth as possible. We don't want any stumbling blocks in our customers' path to purchase.

Here's where GitLab sets a good example. They have just three plans on their pricing page. The pricing for each plan is clearly stated. There's no room for confusion which means there's less chance of buyers backing out. 

In short, if you don't want to scare away potential customers with a complex pricing page, keep things simple. The key is to make your pricing easy to understand, so it doesn't create a hurdle for customers who are ready to make a purchase.
