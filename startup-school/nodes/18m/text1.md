2. Very Small Description of the Topic: 
   This topic explains the importance of doing things that don't scale in the initial stages of a startup, measuring product-market fit, and building a data-driven culture of experimentation.

3. Rewriting the Topic:

Hi there! Let's chat about our exciting journey in the world of startups. 

One key idea we need to grasp, especially when we're early in our startup journey, is that it's okay to do things that don't scale. Yes, you heard it right. At the beginning, you may think about heavy scaling based on experiences from established companies or fancy business school theories. But, for us, those might not apply in the early stages.

Instead, we need to focus on actions that might seem small and inefficient now but are crucial in building our foundation. For example, think about handcrafting your product for the first few customers, or spending hours in discussions with a single user to truly understand their needs. These tasks may appear time-consuming, and yes, they don't scale. But guess what? They help us build a better product and get to know our customers inside and out, whose value is priceless.

Next, how do we **know** our product is really clicking with our users? This is where we talk about measuring product-market fit. There are different ways to do so, but one of the best methods in my book is to track user retention. If our users keep coming back for our product, it's a sign that weâ€™re on the right path!

Finally, let's remember we're in a digital age where decisions are driven by evidence, not by the loudest voice in the room. With that said, it's crucial we build a culture of trials and learning from them - I like to call it a culture of experimentation. This means using data to guide us, trying different things, testing our assumptions, and learning from the outcomes. It may not feel important now when we're small, but as we grow, this experimental, data-informed culture will be our key to making smart choices.

So, there you have it! Do things that don't scale, measure product-market fit, and foster a culture of data-driven experimentation. Happy startup journey!
