## Fundraising Resources for Startups

Okay, let's delve into something really interesting and important for startups: **raising money**. Turns out, lots of people ask us about this subject, probably because it's one of the hardest parts of getting a startup off the ground, right next to creating a product or service that people love.

Now, over the years, there's been boatloads of awesome advice available from **YC (Y Combinator)** about fundraising. I'll highlight some of these resources for you to check out later.

First, we've got some truly insightful essays by **Paul Graham**. He's touched on topics like how to survive the fundraising process, how to secure startup funding, and even how to persuade investors to hitch their wagon to your startup. There's also a fantastic piece about understanding how investors think and behave, known as investor herd dynamics. All these essays are online for you to look at (check the links below).

More recently, **Jeff Ralston**, the president of YC, shared an amazing guide on how to raise an initial, or 'seed', round of funding. He takes you through the whole process, from start to finish. You can find his video presentation on this topic on YouTube. It's a treasure trove of information on navigating your seed round.

Lastly, we have lots of helpful guides on specific topics, like creating a pitch deck (this is a presentation you show to potential investors), how to properly pitch your startup idea, setting up meetings with potential investors, and how to use online platforms, like Angel List, to raise funds. We even have some information about different kinds of investors and what motivates them. If you want to dive deep into fundraising, we've got you covered.
