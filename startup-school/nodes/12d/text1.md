## Conducting Effective User Interviews

Let's chat about how to interview potential customers for your startup. It might feel new, but don't worry, with a few tips, you'll be able to master it in no time.

First, **do these interviews face-to-face**, over video calls, or phone calls. You can learn a lot more in a 5-minute video talk than from many written answers. Also, remember to **make your guest feel at ease**. They'll be sharing insights that maybe no one has asked them before, so it's crucial they trust you and feel comfortable.

Are you ready for the most, most important thing? Here it is: **Keep your idea for later, maybe at the end of the call, or maybe not at all**. Talking about it too soon might lead them to give answers that they think you want to hear. In this interview, your job is to listen, not talk.

One good way to get people to talk about their problems is to ask follow-up questions that don't have a 'yes' or 'no' answer. For example, "Tell me about that." And if you're not recording the interview, **try to take as many notes as you can.**

For better understanding, let’s dive into a pretend chat I have with a potential customer for my imaginary carbon emission company.
>“Hi, when we worked together at Airbnb, did your company care about carbon emissions? … What did you do with the reports? … Why didn’t you act on them? … Why is it important for your business to track emissions?”

Throughout the chat, I steer clear of suggesting any products or solutions. I only ask questions to get to know the problem better. That's how you should approach it.

Here are a few questions you can use:
1. "Tell me how you do _X_ today." (With _X_ being the problem or task you’re trying to solve.)
2. "What's the hardest part of doing _X_?"
3. "Why is it hard?"
4. "How often do you do _X_?"
5. "Why is it important for your business to do _X_?" (Understanding the motivation behind this is very important.)
6. "What ways do you use to solve this problem now?" 

Lastly, **try to understand their behavior, not just what they're saying but what they're doing**. Changing behavior is hard, so knowing what they do now is essential. If you can see them do the task in real time during the interview, that's perfect!

To wrap up, asking the right questions helps us get the right information we need to understand our potential customers better. The more we know, the better we can shape our business to meet their needs. Let's keep practicing, and remember, listening is key.
