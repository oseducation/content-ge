Hello, today we'll talk about a very important topic - refusing to give up when facing rejections during startup fundraising. This is often a tough, but necessary part of the journey for any startup, including the very successful ones.

Let's use "What Not", a marketplace for collectors, as an example. In the winter of 2020, they joined a program with just a trial product and no active users. Basically, their platform was for selling collectible toys - you know those cute toys with the big heads? By the end of the program, they had early signs of success. They had started making sales, attracting buyers and sellers. Money was starting to flow in. Sounds pretty great, right?

But, not everyone was on board. The investors didn't really see its potential and they weren't able to raise as much money as they had hoped for in their seed round. Fast-forward two and half years later, and you'll see a completely different picture. "What Not" now has a whopping worth of $3.7 billion and has raised more than $400 million. Wow, right? Just imagine, a short while ago, they were struggling to find investors.

Rejections happen to everyone, even those who end up building multi-billion dollar businesses. The founders of "What Not" were lucky. They didn't get too disappointed with the early rejections because they believed in their idea. They were confident that their platform was going to be a success, even if others couldn't see it yet.

It's crucial for entrepreneurs to remember this: you don't need every investor's approval, you just need a few to believe in your idea. And the reality is, there are more investors today than ever before, flushed with cash and ready to invest in new, exciting startups. So, don't let a few (or even a lot of) rejections in the beginning shake your faith in your startup. Remember, it's just part of the process. Keep going and stay strong!
