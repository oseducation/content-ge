## The Power of Transactional Businesses

You know, a lot of the most successful startups are transactional businesses because they're directly involved with moving money around. Think of big names like **Stripe**, **Coinbase**, and **Brex**. These companies handle cash, which makes it easy for them to take a piece of that for themselves.

Put simply, a transactional business is located right where cash flows. Back in 2010, when I was in this startup program called YC, the best advice I got was to get as close to the money flow as I could. And these businesses are a great example of that. Stripe, for instance, helps companies handle their cash, and Brex provides corporate credit cards. Their profits come right from this cash flow. 

Now, when you compare this to an affiliate business, it's quite different. These businesses only get money after a bunch of other stuff happens, which means they're far away from the money movement. They just aren't as strong as transactional businesses.

The neat thing about transactional businesses is they often turn into important pieces of the day-to-day work for other companies. They become so embedded in what these companies do, that the thought of removing them is just a headache. For example, if a company was using Stripe to receive payments from customers, they wouldn't want to change that. It's a pretty big hassle.

So that's why these transactional businesses are so strong. They handle cash directly, they become important parts of other companies, and they provide a service that's really needed. Not to mention that they tend to take a larger chunk of the overall value of the market - as much as 29% among the top 100 startup companies. And that's why aiming to be a transactional business is a pretty good idea for any startup.
