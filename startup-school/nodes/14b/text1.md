## When Should I Launch My Startup?

Let's discuss three key points about launching a startup:

1. When should you launch your startup?
2. What makes a good one-line company description?
3. What are the different types of startup launches?

### When to Launch

The first question we're going to tackle is - "When should I launch?" The short and simple answer is - as soon as possible! But you might ask, why? Because as founders, we often believe so strongly in our vision that we might end up living in a dream world. We have strong beliefs and theoretical plans. But remember, the world exists beyond our theories. By launching your startup product quickly - even if it's still in a 'rough around the edges' state - you can confirm if you're actually solving a problem people are willing to pay for. This is invaluable.

### Learning from Early Launches

What if you launch too soon? Well, the worst case is not as bad as you think. Maybe people don't like the look of your product, or it's not as polished as it could be. Maybe you're worried that competitors will see it or, worse, maybe no one will pay any attention at all. But here's the thing - even if that happens, that's alright! In fact, Airbnb launched three times before it started getting substantial user attention. A failed launch should not break your determination. Instead, view it as a learning opportunity!

What's important is launching, learning, and iterating. Repeat this process until you have developed a product that, even if only a few, users absolutely love. Beneficial words from Paul Buchheit, the creator of Gmail and a long-time partner of YC are priceless in this regard - "It's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy." 

### Building a User Base

Cheer up even if you have just a handful of users, as long as they really love your product. This is crucial. Use their feedback to understand what they love about your product and how you can do more of that. 

Identifying and delivering what your loyal users love will help you attract more users. Even if you start with just 10 devoted users, you are on the path to success. It might take time, but keep going!
