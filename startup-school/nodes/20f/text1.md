## YC Application Reviewing: The Basics

Let's chat about what it feels like to be on the other side - the person reviewing your startup application. Here are a few questions that often come up when I look at an application: 

1. **Who are the founders?**  It's vital to understand who is behind the startup â€“ their history, how they met, and the roles each one plays in the startup.

2. **What's their idea?** This question seeks to understand what the startup is all about. Is it a unique idea? Is it easy to comprehend? What's the current product status?

3. **Is there any proof that people want this product?** Are there any users or customers who are eager for what you're building? Additionally, are the founders using the product themselves?

4. **Are the founders committed?** This could be illustrated by things like quitting a job to focus on the startup or applying multiple times with noticeable progress each time.

5. **What's impressive or unique about the startup?** It could be the team, the progress till now, or a novel idea.

After gathering this information, I try to piece together a story about the startup. For instance, "Two tech-savvy friends, who met while working at a leading tech company, quit their jobs to build a cloud company. They already have a basic prototype and a customer using it."

Applications that share unclear information make it hard to understand what exactly the startup does or the team's background, which makes it tough for a reviewer to comprehend the entire vision.

To illustrate, the company "GitLab," currently a public, billion-dollar company, had a clear, concise application describing what they do, who uses their product, and some of its significant users. On the other end, sometimes applications are jumbled, unclear, and unimpressive. This could confuse the reader and negatively influence the assessment.

Here are some tips:

- **Honesty is rewarded.** Any attempt to misrepresent facts like revenue or background can result in disqualification.
- **Back up impressive claims.** If you claim big companies as your customers, you must be ready to prove it.

Remember, your goal is to make sure the reader understands the basics of your startup. Keep it simple, direct, and transparent.
