## Business Models Utilized by Top Y Combinator Companies

Let's chat about business models and what we can learn from top-performing startups, particularly those stamped with the Y Combinator seal of approval. Y Combinator, or YC as it's fondly called, is an organization that provides funding for startups, and they've backed some incredibly successful companies. 

I did a bit of homework and paired the 100 most valuable YC-backed companies with their key business model. This will give us some fascinating insights into what works and what doesn't in the startup world.

Now, keep in mind that while big, established companies might operate under several business models when you're just starting, it's best to stick to just one. With that said, let's dive in!

Among these top 100 companies, it's clear that certain business models dominate the field. Specifically, Software as a Service (SaaS, basically selling access to the software), transaction-related models (businesses that profit from transactions), and marketplaces (platforms where buyers and sellers meet) are standouts.

Together, these three make up 67% of the top 100 YC companies. That's a whopping two-thirds! In comparison, advertising and e-commerce - other popular choices for business models - barely scrape by on the top 100 list.

Something else to bear in mind is the 'power law effect' in startup outcomes. To put it simply, the big fish eat up most of the pond. The top 10 companies account for 50% of the overall value of the YC top 100. That shows the level of success these businesses have achieved compared to the rest.

Key point: Understanding the business models that lead to the greatest startup success can give you valuable guidance in choosing the right model for your own venture. It's all about learning from those who've paved the way!
