## Early Customer Acquisition Strategy Using the Example of Brex

Let's learn from Pedro and Henrique, the people who made Brex, a successful business. Back in Winter 2017, while they were part of a program called YC (which stands for Y Combinator, a sort of school for startups), they got their first 10 customers from other startups in the same program. 

Think of YC as a neighborhood where lots of startups live together. Since they were all startups, Pedro and Henrique asked themselves a simple question: "What's the simplest product we can make that other startups would find useful?" Then, they got those other startups to start using it. In the beginning, all they had was a virtual credit card. 

Enrique from Brex made sure he helped every new customer get started. Now, they could have waited until they had a full-fledged product with a website and a mobile app, but they decided to start as soon as they had something valuable. Above is what their first real (non-virtual) card looked like.

Then, the Brex team sent an email to their YC class and other companies. The email was invite-only, making it seem special and limited, prompting people to take action. 

In the email, they clearly stated that they were offering a corporate credit card designed for tech companies. They assured that there were no annual fees and they would support startups that were just beginning. The pitch was directly aimed at their potential customers.

Even though the email was long, it worked because they were solving a real problem their customers had â€“ they offered a no-personal-guarantee credit card for startups, which was not offered by other credit card companies at the time. 

This story of Brex shows the power of having a good idea, a simple solution, and directly getting your product in front of the right people.
