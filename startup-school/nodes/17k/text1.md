## Key Traits of Successful Startups

Let's talk about the special marks of top-ranking companies that make them stand out. Remember, we will be using simple words and ideas to explain this, so don't worry if you are a beginner.

* **Repeated business**: This means the company can get customers to keep coming back and spending more money. It's like having a reliable source of money.
* **Strong customer ties**: Once people start using the company's product or service, they just don't want to stop. The company is so good at keeping its customers.
* **Strong defenses**: The company builds things (not physical things but more like strategies, relationships, and methods) that make it tough for other businesses to compete against them.
* **Close to the transaction**: This means the company places itself right where the buying and selling happen. This position gives it more control and more ways to make money. 
* **Lean on software, not humans**: The company uses technology to do more work instead of hiring more people. This means they can grow quickly without needing to add lots of employees. 
* **Proven and familiar business models**: The business runs in a way that customers understand and trust because it has been successful before. It's like taking a path that was walked by many people before.

The main point? Focus on making your product or service different and better. That's where your new ideas should be. When it comes to how you run your business, take pointers from successful companies. Don't reinvent the wheel, but make your wheel better!
