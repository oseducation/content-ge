## Identifying and Resolving Bottlenecks in Startups: Super Daily Case Study

Imagine navigating a busy day, not only handling usual tasks but also trying to figure out the most important numbers (or KPIs) for your startup. On top of that, you're trying to uncover the main issue stopping your key number from growing. Sounds tough, right? Let's look at a real-life example to understand this better.

There's a company called Super Daily from a startup program called YC. This company from India was in the business of delivering groceries daily and was later bought by a bigger company called Swiggy in 2018. When Super Daily first launched its service, there were a lot of things that could have been improved. It was complex - mobile app, tools for operations, managing goods, and messy local logistics. 

Even in this chaos, they had their main goal set - they wanted to grow. They noticed a big problem right here. People who were almost signing up ended up not doing so. High-potential users were not becoming customers - they needed to understand why. 

Their first steps were to start conversations and experiment to understand this issue. Interestingly, they found out that people were leaving because Super Daily didn't have a specific brand of milk that a lot of customers wanted. Altering their sign-up page wasn't the solution, they needed that particular brand of milk. They decided to have that milk brand in their list, rather than making their sign-up page look better.

Once they figured out their big problem and addressed it, they started focusing on maybe less interested users who came to know about Super Daily from friends or those who were just giving the app a look. Now that they had the popular milk brand, even these less interested users started becoming customers. They were not anymore improving something that had issues at a later point. Thanks to this new brand, Super Daily was able to grow its customer numbers by 50%.

To handle these issues, a simple guideline would be beneficial.
