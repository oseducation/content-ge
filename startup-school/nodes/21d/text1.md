## Great Leaders Have Strong Personal Integrity and Commitment

Let's talk about an important trait that many successful leaders share - strong personal integrity and commitment. In easy terms, they have a strong sense of right and wrong and are very dedicated to their missions beyond just their own personal benefits. 

Why is this important? Think about it. If a leader practices things like favoritism, has conflicts of interest, uses inappropriate language, or maintains improper work relations, that can lead to a loss of trust. And, trust is a huge part of being a strong leader. If your team can't trust you, leading becomes much harder. 

On the other hand, commitment refers to really diving into your work and making it your life's work. This kind of passion inspires others around you. They see your dedication and they start to feel it too. That kind of feeling can make your team follow you through thick and thin. 

So, how can you work on this? Well, I have an easy piece of advice. It is what I call the "transparency test". This means you ask yourself if everything you said and did was made public to everyone in your company, would you feel embarrassed? If the answer is yes, then there's room for improvement. We all make mistakes, but repeated mistakes and those that harm your integrity, or others' perception of your integrity are especially damaging. So, it's something to be mindful of as a leader. 

In short, that's the third key point about leadership - strong personal integrity and commitment are crucial and respected characteristics of any good leader.
