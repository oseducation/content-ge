## Prioritization in Startups: Time Management and Making Impactful Decisions
Let's delve into a vital aspect of running a startup, and that's **prioritization**. Now, when we talk about prioritizing, there are essentially two ways to look at it. 

First, there's how you divide your time between working on your startup and managing other areas of your life. Now, I can't tell you exactly how to handle this as it's a deeply personal choice. Just like life, it hinges on a lot of things - what else you have on your plate, and how you fancy spending your hours. This is such an expansive topic that we won't be able to fully explore it today.

With that said, I want to highlight two points. One, keep in mind that **speed is key** in the startup world. And two, it's extremely crucial to find common ground with your co-founder when it comes to setting expectations.

The second way to look at prioritization, and what we'll focus on today, is how you should employ the time you set aside for working on your startup to make sure you're putting your energy where it counts. Our goal is to help you make sure you're focusing on the most impactful tasks for your venture. This will be our first stepping stone in our journey towards prioritizing.
