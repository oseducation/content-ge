## Case Studies: How Airbnb, Twitch, and Stripe Launched

## **Airbnb**

Airbnb is a classic example of a company that started with a very simple MVP. In 2008, their first landing page was quite simple compared to what we see today. How simple? Imagine this: there were no payment options online. If you booked a place on Airbnb, you exchanged money with the host in person! You also couldn't see where the house was located on a map. Despite these shortcomings, they still managed to start their business and iterate on their product.

## **Twitch**

Another interesting example is Twitch. On its first day, Twitch was known as Justin.tv, and it was a one-channel online reality TV show. The video quality was so low you could hardly see people's faces, let alone any details in their apartment. There were no video games unless the people in the apartment decided to play some. Despite this, today Twitch is a globally popular live-streaming platform. 

**Stripe** 

Well, it wasn't called Stripe at the start. They chose a really funky name - "/dev/payments". Cool, isn't it? This was the state of Stripe on the first day: No fancy bank deals, just a simple service. I won't get into the details of how they processed payments, but let's just say they did it in a very 'startup' way. One interesting point I want to make is that, if you decided to use Stripe, the founders would actually come to your office to help you integrate it. Isn't that friendly and industrious? A smart way to find and fix problems early, right?


The stripped-down version of a product that a startup first builds is often known as the **Minimum Viable Product** or **MVP**. The examples I've given you are billion-dollar companies, but their MVPs were really simplistic and bare-bones.
