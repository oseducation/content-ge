## Next Steps after User Interviews
So, you've just completed your first few user interviews. You've got about five or ten under your belt, and you've been dutifully documenting everything in the process. What do you do next? Let's break it down into simple steps.

1. **Gather Your Notes:** The first thing you want to do is to make sure you've captured notes from every single interview. You can use things like sticky notes or a simple computer program to keep everything organized.

2. **Sort Out Your Learning:** You can group what you've learned into different piles. Each pile might reflect a different problem that you've identified. The goal here is to find out which problem is the most important one that needs solving.

3. **Write Down Your Conclusions:** What have you learned from these interviews? Write it all down. This will help you digest everything and make sense of all the information you've gathered.

4. **Form a Hypothesis:** Using all this information you've gathered, think about what the solution to the problem might be. Don't make this too complicated, keep it simple. You're just making an educated guess at this point.

5. **Start Building Your MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Using your hypothesis, start building your MVP as quickly as you can. You want to test this MVP with the information you've gathered. 

Remember, the goal here isn't to overthink the process or get buried in details. You want to get going on your MVP as quickly as possible, but you also want to make sure you're informed by the user interviews you've conducted. Happy building!
