## Navigating Startup Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Revenue Generation

Now, let's talk about an area that can be a bit confusing - Startup key performance indicators (KPIs) and the path to earning money. This discussion is important because sometimes, startups can fall into a trap where they see growth, but it's not the kind of growth that brings in money. 

When we talk about KPIs, a couple of buzzwords you might come across are CAC (Cost of Acquiring Customer) and LTV (Lifetime Value of a Customer). Although you might feel the pressure to focus on these, let's hold off for a bit. These are things businesses often think about after they've figured out that people like their product and want to buy it. At this point, the focus should be on how to grow the number of users rapidly. 

For now, what matters most is how much money you spend to get a customer and how quickly they pay you back. In a perfect world, the time taken to earn back what you spent to get the customer would be zero. This means the new customer starts bringing in profit from day one! However, keep an eye on if your customers are sticking around - if they're not, then the costs might not be worth it. If you have to spend money to get customers, try to figure out how quickly they pay back that money. 

Next, let's talk about a common mistake some startups make - focusing too much on free users or daily users. Remember, people who are willing to pay for a product will likely want different things than those who aren't. If you are planning to charge for your product in the future, do not rely too much on feedback from free users. Free users often do not represent your ideal customers and their feedback might lead you away from what your real customers want. The one exception might be if you're building a product where the more people use it, the better it gets, like Uber. 

Here is a real-life story to show why this matters: Scribd, a company that started in 2006, spent four years growing its free user base. They feared if they started charging, they would lose their user base. However, when they began charging in 2010, they saw that while they did lose over 90% of their customers, their revenue went up significantly. They now had a business that brought in money! And best of all, they now understood better what their paying users desired. 

So the takeaway here is that to run a successful startup, don't fall into the trap of merely increasing free sign-ups or daily users. Focus on gaining paying customers as they are the ones who will truly grow your business.
