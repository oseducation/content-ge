## Understanding Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Hey there! Let's dive into a really important part of the digital world, called Search Engine Optimization, or SEO for short. It sounds fancy, but it's pretty simple once you understand it. SEO has had a big makeover in the last few years and it's become quite a competition, especially with big businesses, like Pinterest or TripAdvisor, stepping in.

In the past, millions of websites would each rank for tons of keywords. But now, these bigger companies are managing to rank for an enormous list of keywords! They've become really good at this. So, if you are thinking of using SEO to help your little business grow, you need to be ready to compete with these giants. It might sound challenging, but remember, a small snowball can eventually become a huge snowball, right?

The world of SEO is pretty much like a game where you are competing against others. And to make it even more exciting, the game is ever-changing! For instance, words or phrases that people search for, known as *'keywords'*, keep evolving. Take the example of ASMR, a term quite popular these days. A few years ago, nobody was searching for it. Now, there's a rush for ranking for it. So, keep an eye on those keyword trends!

Our next stop is understanding how SEO works, technically. Imagine a webpage. What you or I would see and what Google sees, are two different scenarios - we see images, colors and graphics, but Google sees *only text*. To win at SEO, you need to show Google the right text, essentially giving it a clear picture of what your website is all about.

You might now ask, "How do we get better at SEO?" Well, you have two main tools to work with. The first one relates to things *on your webpage*. For example, the title of your page, whether Google can understand your page and even if your page has any technical issues. You can choose what specific keyword you want your page to rank for. So, start by figuring out what your audience is searching for and build your content around that.

The second tool relates to things *away from your page*, which we often call off-page optimization or domain authority. It's about how Google sees your website's worth among all other websites. It's like the popularity contest of the web world. The more other high-quality websites refer you (think of it like getting votes), the more valuable you become in the eyes of Google, and thus, it ranks you higher.

Bear in mind that the best place to start with SEO is on Google itself. Rather than writing and then trying to fit keywords in, think in the reverse order. Look for what people are searching for, and craft your content accordingly. It's a balance of on-page and off-page SEO that will help you get closer to your goal of being in the top spots of the search list.

This is the high-level idea of how SEO works - if you're curious and want deeper details, you can always search online for more information. Remember, SEO is a game. The more you play it, the better you get at it! Happy SEOing!
