Alrighty, let's focus on how to fill in a YC application and some useful hints to make yours stand out. Super straight-forward, you just head to our website and apply. There's no need to email us or send us a presentation or anything like that. 

Now, here are a few tips to ace your application:

* Complete the entire application. I cannot stress this enough! Especially the part about founder biographies. Some applications that don't impress us much are the ones where the founders have not taken the time to fill the biography section properly. Just remember, putting in extra effort shows that you're serious about this!

* Mind your language: I mean your grammar, punctuation marks and capital letters. They might seem small, but trust me, it makes a big difference.

* Spot-on Founder Video: Stick to the instructions given for the founder video. And not just this, our whole application process comes with detailed instructions. We gauge your attention to detail by seeing how well you've followed these instructions. So, top tip for you - read everything thoroughly and follow the instructions to the tee.

* Succinct Written Answers: In the written portion, clarity and brevity are your friends. Avoid writing an epic tale and don't believe that a long answer will score you extra points. Too lengthy and we might not even scroll through your whole answer. So keep it brief, clear, and answer the question straight-up.

And there you have it! Some handy tips to make your YC application shine. Remember, it's about showing us your sincere interest and attention to detail. Best of luck!
