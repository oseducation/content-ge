Our chat today is about a very important concept in the startup world - doing "**Things That Don't Scale**."

We're going to use Airbnb as our real-life example. Around 2009, Airbnb was still in the early stages. They were just a handful of people with a website that didn't quite match what they were trying to do. Originally, their website, airbed and breakfast.com, was set up to offer air mattresses to people going to design conferences. It wasn't going so well.

When they began the Y Combinator program (*this is a popular startup creating program*), Paul Graham, one of the leaders there, had a very important question. He asked, "Who are your users?" 

At that time, Airbnb's site had a listing page with three things - a picture of the host, one photo of the building from the outside, and a map. The only similar site was Craigslist, so there wasn't much comparison. But something was missing - potential users couldn't tell if the listing was good or if they could trust the host. So, how did they figure out these missing pieces?

Now, this is where it gets interesting. The Airbnb group flew to New York, where most of their few hosts were. But they didn't go as the **founders** of the company, they went as **photographers** hired by Airbnb. 

Why? They wanted to understand how their product was being used, what challenges their hosts were facing. So while one founder was snapping pictures to make the Airbnb listing look fantastic, the others were speaking with the hosts to get feedback.

This is a perfect example of "Things That Don't Scale." They couldn't realistically fly to every host in every city. But by doing this unscalable thing, they gained so much insight that they wouldn't have gotten just sitting behind their computers.

What was the result? They flew back to San Francisco, uploaded the pictures they took, and fixed many of the bugs and issues the hosts had complained about. The hosts appreciated this, and this appreciation laid the foundation for Airbnb's growth. They knew their product inside-out and made sure it worked for their early users.

So, here's what Airbnb teaches us: In the early stages of your startup, don't be afraid to do things that don't seem scalable. Engage with your customers intimately, understand their problems, and strive to fix them. This could just be the kick-starter to phenomenal growth.
