    "name": "Understanding Market Gaps",
    "question": "Why did VetCove initially face little competition?",
    "choices": [{
        "choice": "Because there were already established giants in the tech field.",
        "is_right_choice": false
    }, {
        "choice": "Because they patented their business model quickly.",
        "is_right_choice": false

        "choice": "Because veterinarians were not the typical target for Silicon Valley tech innovators.",
        "is_right_choice": true
    }, {
        "choice": "Because ordering supplies online was a new concept.",
        "is_right_choice": false
    }],
    "explanation": "VetCove encountered minimal competition at its inception primarily because the space they entered—creating an Amazon-like platform for veterinarians—was overlooked by tech innovators. Silicon Valley often targets more mainstream or trending sectors, leaving niches like veterinary supplies unexplored despite their potential."
