## Understanding Marketplaces in the Startup Domain

Let's chat about something interesting and exciting - marketplace startups. You might already be using many of these! The likes of Airbnb, Instacart, Doordash, OpenSea, and Fair are actually marketplace startups. 

What's so cool about them? Well, it turns out, that these types of startups often become *the* place to go for their industry. They become so big that they don't leave much space for others trying to set up shop in the same area. It's like they're the big fish in their pond. 

These startups only make up 14 of the top 100 companies, but they hold a whopping 30% of the overall value! That's because quite a few of them fall in the top ten. 

Getting them up and running isn't a walk in the park, though. They have what we call a "chicken and egg problem." You can't simply make your product and wait for customers to come. You need to look after both halves of the marketplace - the people offering something and the people wanting it - at the same time. Sounds tricky, right?

But here comes the good part. When they get past a certain point, and things start to work, they benefit from something amazing - network effects. This means the value of the platform goes up with each new user. Just like the saying "The more the merrier!"

Take Airbnb as an example, if you need a place to stay, you'll probably head to Airbnb because that's where all the options are. Similarly, for buying or selling NFTs, you would most likely go to OpenSea. This is because everyone is there, and that's what makes them the big winners.

So that's an overview of marketplace startups - they're challenging to start, but once they take off, they can really dominate their industry.
