## Example of Strong Founder-to-User Connection in Airbnb

The most successful brands are those that openly engage with their users, truly understanding their needs and motivations. One such example comes from **Airbnb** and its CEO, *Brian Chesky*.

Let's take a stroll down memory lane to 2010. Picture this: *Brian Chesky*, Airbnb's CEO, decides to live in 50 different Airbnb homes over the span of a few months. You're probably thinking, "Why put himself through all that trouble?"

God is in the details, folks, and many missed the deep purpose behind this move. It might have seemed like a wild idea, but let me tell you, it was an inspired one.

Brian's living experiment provided him the golden opportunity to directly engage with 50 different hosts, one-on-one on each day of his journey. Think about it - what could be a more real, direct source of honest feedback than that?

Without Airbnb hosts, the platform wouldn't be what it is today. So, what Brian and his co-founders Joe and Nate did was to deeply engage with and understand their hosts. To this day, Brian and Joe still receive calls from hosts on their private numbers.

They didn't hide behind faceless "info" or "do not reply" emails - they gave their direct contact details to hosts. For a time, this was considered a rather wild idea. While most founders turned their focus on scalable growth channels like Google Ads, they remained front and center with their customers.

Sadly, not many leaders follow this approach today. Often hiding behind anonymous email addresses, they lose personal connection with their users. Skeptical? Look for 'do not reply' emails in your inbox and see how many there are.

Being accessible to your users is not just a nice-to-do, but rather, it's a must-do. Especially in the startup world, understanding and engaging with your users can be the difference between a brand's success and its failure. Let's learn, shall we, from Airbnb's playbook.
