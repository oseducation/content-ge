## Most Startups Don't Have Product-Market Fit

Here's a fact I've come across a lot in my journey: The majority of startups are on a tightrope struggling to find a balance - this is where they're trying to achieve something called **product-market fit**. They have high hopes, believing they've got it all figured out, but in reality, things aren't always rosy. So, if you're a startup founder, it's very likely you'll find yourself on this tightrope too.

Now, there's this common thought among newbie startup people, they think, "If I make my product and show it to the world, bingo - it'll be a success!" But let's come back down to earth. Sadly, that's not how it usually works. Our world is chock full of hustle and bustle, and let me tell you, there's no crowd waiting eagerly with open arms for your product. The moment you launch it, they're not going to come running to try it out.

This notion can be a tough pill to swallow for those who've never questioned "How will I reach my audience?" before. Many have spent time in big companies or educational habitats where this wasn't a worry. But being a part of a startup is a whole different ball game. The ball is in your court now, and the hurdles - reaching your customers and making your product a perfect fit for them - can really hit hard early on. 

So, it's absolutely essential to be aware of these issues. You're not just building a product, you're also building a way to reach your audience. Plan every step accordingly. Remember, releasing a product and hoping for the best without a proper strategy is like throwing a ball in the dark hoping it'll score.
