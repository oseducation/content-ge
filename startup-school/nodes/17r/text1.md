## The Power of Pricing: The Story of Segment

The world of startups is full of lessons, and today, I'm going to share one that's all about the power of pricing. We're diving into the story of Segment â€“ a company that helps firms handle and utilize their customer data better.

So, here's the deal. The segment started with a group of tech-minded folks who weren't accustomed to paying for products themselves. Naturally, they thought a free product offering was the key to getting people hooked. As they aimed to attract investors, they realized they needed to display revenue growth. So, they mustered the courage to contact their free users with a simple yet nerve-racking proposal - start paying them $10 a month or $120 annually.

You'd think people would back away, right? Well, that's not what happened. Their customers started replying along the lines of, "I was hoping you'd charge more than that. Otherwise, I'd worry about the safety of my customer data". Unexpected, huh? Their low cost actually raised doubts about their product's value and reliability, rather than acting as an incentive.

So what happened next? They took on a sales advisor who insisted that their actual price tag should be an eye-watering $120,000 a year, labeling it as an enterprise-level product. Scary, right? It definitely freaked the Segment team out!

Their advisor, though, was firm on his decision. In fact, he made it very clear - either they propose the new price to their customers or he'd quit. So, they go into a meeting, the moment of truth arrives, and the CEO hesitantly states the new price. The customer, on the other hand, offers $12,000.

They don't reach the advisor's lofty target, but *surprise*, they settle at $18,000 a year. That meant, from a modest $120 a year, they successfully pumped up their price by 150 times! All they had to do was ask.

Empowered by this new pricing approach, they kept pulling in larger deals, and eventually, Twilio acquired Segment for over $3 billion. Hence, the crucial lesson from Segment's journey - they started by offering their service free of cost, then ended up selling to big firms, and built a company worth a staggering $3 billion.

So, to sum up, pricing holds power. It can signal the value of your product and even shape your customer's trust. And sometimes, charging more can actually be good for your business.
