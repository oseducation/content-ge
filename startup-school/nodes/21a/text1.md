## Observations on Leadership in Startups

Let's talk about this very important thing, **Leadership**. Now when it comes to leadership, I have three things I've learned that I'd like to share with you. 

The first thing is that, **there isn't just one 'cookie-cutter' image of what a good leader looks like**. Across all different types of people, there are great leaders. This was a bit of a surprise for me too. I used to think, there was a standard model or style of leadership, a specific way to talk or act to become a respected leader. But, as I came to work with diverse leaders, I realized that they're all very different. 

You have people who are quiet and introspective, and others who are outgoing and sociable. There are those drawn to technology and those attracted to storytelling. Some are coolheaded diplomats, some have more fiery temperaments. They can be the geeky type or the suave type. 

This is great news because it means **anyone can potentially be a great leader regardless of their personality**. But, the other side to this coin is that if you want to be a great leader and earn people's trust, **you need to be true to yourself**.

You cannot pretend to be someone else and hope to be followed. For example, you cannot act like Steve Jobs expecting people to consider you the same. The CEO of Netflix, Reed Hastings, shared a similar experience. He tried mimicking Jobs early in his career but then realized he couldn't be anyone but himself. After that, his leadership skills improved significantly.

In the end, it's important to remember that we can tell when someone isn't being true. It's hard to follow or trust someone if we think they're putting on a show. So, the first takeaway about leadership here would be that a good leader can come in various packages. You don't need to be a specific type of person, but **you do need to be authentic**.
