## Prioritizing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Startups

Let's dissect a concept that is a must-know for all startup enthusiasts: Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs. 

Firstly, I'd like you to understand the bigger puzzle that we're tackling. **KPIs are those special numbers or facts** that act like a report card for your startup, indicating its health and success. To make it simpler, they tell you what's working and what's not.

Now, straight away into why this topic should matter to you. You'd want your valuable time and energy to be invested in things that create a real difference to your startup. That's where KPIs come in. 

Imagine you've just started your venture and are curious about whether your efforts are truly paying off. Here, your ultimate KPI should be **revenue growth.** Why? Because money coming into your startup is a solid sign that it's catching on!

However, let's say you're feeling rebellious and don't want to consider revenue growth as your main KPI, that's when you should ask yourself 'Why?' We'll chat more about the reasons later, but trust me, it's significant to question this because choosing a non-revenue KPI usually isn't the best route.

If you are at the stage prior to launch, then your KPIs can be days remaining until launch or a number of interactions with potential customers. But remember, once you've hit the launch button, swiftly shift your KPIs to match revenue growth.

Apart from identifying your main KPI, you should also define a weekly goal. For instance, it can be an aim to attract, say five more paying customers by the end of the week. Your goal will keep reminding you about the need for speed in your startup's growth, considering fast early growth is really powerful and impactful.

For some inspiration, have a glance at Airbnb's startup journey. The founders wrote down their weekly KPI goals on their bathroom mirror! This faced them with their goals multiple times a day, thereby creating a sense of urgency and motivation.

In summary, **identifying the right KPIs and setting regular goals** not only keeps your startup running smoothly but also serves as a constant reminder of the pace at which you need to move forward. Remember, time waits for no one, and neither does entrepreneurship. Happy strategizing!
