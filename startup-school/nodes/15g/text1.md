## Prioritizing Sales and Targeting Early Adopters in Startups

Understanding your sales funnel and figuring out who your targets should be is key to your business growth. Here's the golden rule - make your first steps towards the customers who are the easiest to convert. You shouldn't overwhelm yourself trying to get the toughest leads. 

Startups really don't have all the time in the world to chase every possible lead that comes their way. It's a big market out there, but understand this - you don't need to try to appeal to everyone. Aim for the leads that are the easiest to convert, the ones most likely to say "yes" to your offering.

Imagine your sales pipeline as a river full of fish (potential customers) and your goal is to catch as many as you can. Now, some fish are hard to reel in, while others are simply eager to bite. You’ll want to focus your attention on those that seem more interested. It's pretty clear from their first few interactions - some reply to your emails faster, and some give positive responses during your sales calls. Focus on these leads.

In this journey, don’t fear losing a few fish. If a potential client seems to be leading you on a wild goose chase with calls, without showing any concrete interest, be open and honest. Politely suggest reconnecting in a few months, leaving room for prospects who are genuinely interested and easier to convert.

As you embark on this sales journey, remember these points:
- **Existing connections are brilliant starting points:** Leverage your network because discussions with familiar names are often smoother.
- **Startups can be excellent targets:** From personal experience, startups are easier to pitch to because they aren’t entangled in red tape. Large corporations often have complex processes and a dedicated department for negotiations, which can take up a lot of your time. However, startups generally have faster decision-making and are driven towards trying new solutions. That’s why they are easier to convert and can be ideal first customers.
- **Most people are not early adopters:** It might sound disheartening, but it's true. The reason you've to send hundreds of emails is that many people are not prone to trying new things. However, there are some like me, who love experimenting. I remember, during my Airbnb days, I would be thrilled when a startup emailed me their new product. I was an early adopter. To reach such individuals, aim to send more emails.

So, an important part of your initial strategy in sales should be to identify these early adopters. Don't fret about the rest. Be patient, keep sending those outbound messages, and soon, you'll see the results.
