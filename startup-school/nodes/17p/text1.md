## Key Pricing Strategies for Startups: Pricing Isn't Permanent

Let's talk about the **price tag**. Yes, figuring out that magic number for your product or service can be a nerve-wracking task for anyone starting out. 

Sometimes, the worry might be that if you don't get that price right from the get-go, your first sale could very well be your last. Or, you might think that the potential customers you're speaking with are all you've got, so the pressure's on to nail your pitch to every single one of them. However, if you're running into either of these fears as the main obstacle, it may be time to reconsider various aspects of your business strategy. 

But here's the silver lining - the rulebook has no chapter saying **pricing is set in stone**. In reality, finding that sweet spot - something that resonates with the customer while also carrying the business costs - is more of an evolving process. 

This journey of pricing starts with your **initial customers**. Let's say you decide to increase your prices. What happens to your existing customers? Well, you have a couple of options. One way is to let your existing customers keep their current prices, and only increase the price for new customers. 

Alternatively, you could announce a future price increase - the key is to time this well. If you've been adding value to your product, you should still see some heads nodding in agreement for this new number. In simpler words, if you've made a product your customers love and regularly use, most of them are likely to still hang around despite a reasonable price hike. 

Check out **Netflix** for some inspiration. Over the years, their prices have steadily gone up - and they haven't been shy about it! But guess what? With a steady stream of compelling content, their subscriber-base has also grown to a whopping 221 million paid subscribers! They've found that growing their revenue via price increase is more feasible than trying to grow at the same rate through an increase in subscribers. 

So, if Netflix can do it with millions of customers, there's certainly hope for your budding business. So, don't feel stuck with your price. Take your time, experiment, learn, and keep adjusting. Let your pricing journey be an essential part of your growth narrative!
