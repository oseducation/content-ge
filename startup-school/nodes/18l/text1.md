I want to talk to you about something special today - it's called **A/B testing**. I know the name might seem a bit technical, but trust me, it's a super helpful tool especially when you're building a new app or a website. I'll explain why this is important and help you understand when you should start thinking about it. 

Imagine this: You're trying to give a new look to your website's home page. You've done all the work, made all the changes and finally, you launch it. But suddenly, you see the number of people visiting your website has decreased. What could have gone wrong? This is a tricky spot, my friend, but guess what - there's a better way to handle this, and that's A/B testing.

Before you start scratching your heads, let me tell you what A/B testing is all about. You can think of it like you're in a superhero movie where you can create two different worlds at the same time - one with your new website design and one with your old design. Like a fair race, you let both versions run at the same time and see what works better for your audience. It's like having a magic mirror showing you what could have happened in an alternative universe. 

The beauty of A/B testing is that it takes the guesswork out and can show you precisely what impact the new design has - did it help to improve things or cause the numbers to go down. This powerful tool stands by your side when everyone is guessing and debating about what went wrong or right.

Take the example of Airbnb. They had a similar situation where they launched two designs for their mobile app share sheet - one was their old design and the other new. They couldn't predict which one would work better, so they ran an A/B test. And guess what, the new design was 40% better in increasing the number of shares! 

So, see how A/B testing can turn out to be your best friend in making decisions. It's like a trusty flashlight guiding you through the darkness of guesswork and assumptions. Always remember to use tools like Google's A/B testing calculator before you leap and make the redesign live. However, you don't need to worry about this too much in your early days. Get to it whenever you're ready and have a good number of users on your website or app.

Remember, key decisions about your product are tough and data can be your strongest ally. Even if you think you have good product instincts, data can provide insights that aren't always obvious. So, keep learning, keep iterating, and most importantly, keep testing!
