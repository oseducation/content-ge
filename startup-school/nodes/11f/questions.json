    "explanation": "Documenting a process for handling co-founder disagreements is recommended because it provides a structured and fair method for resolving conflicts, particularly useful when emotions are high and logical thinking may be compromised.

    "explanation": "The Mater company's approach was unique because they documented a simple guide to handle disagreements, detailing different choices, who made the final decisions, when they were made, and the reasons behind them. This method contrasts with resolving conflicts through votes, avoiding discussions, or using a mediator, providing a clear and structured way to navigate disagreements."

        "choice": "Ignore the disagreement entirely.",

    "explanation": "Setting up rules in advance for handling disagreements allows co-founders to follow a predefined process when conflicts arise. This is beneficial because it helps ensure that decisions are made logically and fairly, even when emotions may otherwise cloud judgment. It is not about ignoring disagreements, making decisions based on hierarchy, or depending on external mediators exclusively."
