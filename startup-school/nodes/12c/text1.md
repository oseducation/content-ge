## Process of Identifying and Reaching Out to Potential Users

### Exploring Who to Talk To 

As you get your startup going, it's important to **understand your audience**. This could be talking to your customers, your network, or even your co-workers. Here are two main groups you should consider:

-   **Your personal network**: It might seem simple, but people who know you are more likely to answer your questions. Just remember, they might not be fully honest because they might not want to hurt your feelings. Don't let the fear of rejection stop you from reaching out to them!

-   **Your co-workers or former colleagues**: These are great people to talk to because they already understand your work and might be potential users of your product, particularly if you're building software for startups. They may also bring you potential users outside of your personal or professional circles. 

How can you find these early users? Many startup founders commonly use LinkedIn, online forums, chat communities like Slack or Discord, and sometimes even in-person events!

### Building a Mock Startup

Now, let's try to understand the whole process by creating a **mock startup**. This isn't a real company, but let's pretend as though it is. 

Our startup's goal is to help companies reduce their carbon emissions. Our plan is simple: 

 1. Interview potential customers to understand the problems and motivations around carbon emissions.

 2. Try to define what our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will look like. 

To do my homework, my plan is to connect with folks in roles like founders, CEOs, and CFOs, along with people possessing interesting titles related to carbon, climate, or sustainability on LinkedIn.

### Learning and Understanding 

What are we trying to learn from this? Three main things: 

-   Does the company they work for care about their carbon emissions?
-   Why do they care or not care about their carbon emissions?
-   Who in that company might be the one who cares the most about this, and why?

### Example Messages for Outreach 

Once you identify who to talk to, here are a few sample messages to start a conversation:

-   For the CFO at my former company: 

    >Hi [Name], 
    I hope you're doing well since our time at [Company]. I'm working on a new project, and I wondered if I could chat with you for about 20 minutes to get your thoughts?

-   For a person I don't know, with relevance to carbon emissions:

    >Hi [Name], 
    I hope this message finds you well. I'm currently working on a project aimed at helping companies reduce their carbon emissions. Would you care for a quick chat on this topic?

And that's it! I hope this lecture helps you understand the importance of knowing your audience, reaching out to them, and asking them the right questions.
