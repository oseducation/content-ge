## Understanding Growth Channels and Tactics for Startups

Let's chat about how you can make your startup grow. But before we dive in, it's important to note: that if your product isn't catching on with your customers, don't worry about this yet. It's like trying to pour more water into a leaky bucket - not very helpful if the water just flows out, right? 

Focus first on making a product that some people like very much. Then, and only then, should you seriously start to think about **growth channels and tactics**.

There are two key paths to growing your business:

**1. Improving your product and getting more people to use it (Product Growth and Conversion Rate Optimization)**  
Think about the parts of your product that are used the most or have the best feedback. Now, imagine you have a team of smart folks - engineers, designers, data scientists, and product managers - all working together to make those parts even better. They're doing everything they can to make sure that more people not just start to use your product, but stick around and make the product a part of their lives.

**2. Using other platforms to reach more people (Growth Channels)**  
Some platforms are like big, crowded streets. Lots of people walking around, looking to discover new things. Google is one such 'street'. People go to Google when they're searching for something, which could just as well be your product. That's why Google, Facebook, and Instagram are so important for startups. They're crowded streets where you can put up a sign for your product and get a lot of people to notice it.

Remember, it's about not just bringing in more customers, but also about making sure they have a good experience and want to keep using your product. Hold off with growth until you have a product people love, then use these tactics to take your startup to the next level.
