## Understanding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Prioritization for Startups

Let's dive into a couple of key building blocks for a successful startup: Key Performance Indicators (or KPIs for short) and **prioritization**. Let's break them down, shall we?

First up, KPIs! This acronym stands for **Key Performance Indicator**. Think of KPIs as a measuring stick for your startup's performance. These are the special metrics that you track and share with your team and even outside your company. They show whether your business strategies are working or if you need to make changes.

Now, let's talk **prioritization**. You probably have a million things to do each day, right? Well, unfortunately, each day only has 24 hours. So, you've got to decide what needs your attention first. That's where prioritization helps out! It guides you on how to use your time and direct your team's work.

Let's imagine you have a list of tasks for the day. (*Pull out an imaginary note*) Each point on this list may seem important. However, probably only a couple will drive your business towards your key goals—meeting your market needs or *product-market fit*. You need to find and focus on these.

The reason we're talking about KPIs and prioritization together is simple: **Prioritization is all about working on **the things that will make the** biggest impact on your KPIs**. Therefore, it's crucial you pick the right KPIs and be honest about which tasks will move those KPIs the furthest.

It's common to see startups working hard but on the wrong things, focusing on *vanity metrics*—things that may look impressive on LinkedIn but don't drive real business progress. Avoid this trap!

Now, why are KPIs and prioritization so vital for your startup's success? Well, as a founder, it's up to you to decide what to do with your work hours. You could fall into the trap of busy work—ticking off tasks that don't really move your business forward.

A few examples might be wasting time perfecting a feature no one uses or choosing to tackle complex issues rather than focusing on what your users want. Remember, while being busy can feel good, it's vital to ensure you're running *fast* and in the *right direction*.

Speeding towards the market brings various benefits, like earning money sooner, gaining the ability to reinvest in your business, and reducing dependence on outside funds. Moving slowly can see competitors copy you, also it burns more cash and can morally downgrade your team.

So choose wisely, use your time to make real progress and put your energy where it counts!
