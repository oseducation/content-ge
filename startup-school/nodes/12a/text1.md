## Importance of Talking to Users Early and Continuously

Let's break down how to understand your customers and use that understanding to build your Minimum Viable Product or MVP (The first simple version of your product). This is different from what you may think. 

Many people wrongly imagine that creating startups is something that busy money people dream up on a lazy Sunday, or that software folks crank out during a late-night coding marathon. If that's your idea, you're in for a surprise. It's not like that at all. 

Now you might recall a scene from the movie "The Social Network". It's a good film, but let me tell you, it gets a lot wrong about how a real startup like Facebook began. 

Instead, let me introduce you to Brian Chesky. He's the guy who co-started Airbnb. See him in this photo? On his left is Amal, the very first Airbnb guest. They hang out together in San Francisco for a weekend. 

Do you see a difference between this real-life photo and that movie scene? You've got it! This photo from real life shows a two-way chat with a genuine customer. 

Smart starters of a business talk with future customers even before there's a product available. To be honest, the top achievers in the business field keep learning from their users throughout their company's life. But, of course, this comes after you've worked out who your real users are.

Why should you learn from your customers, you ask? They're the only ones who really keep you honest. As the ones actually giving you money, they have the strongest stake in your offering. If there's anyone who'll tell you the real story, it's them. 

So in short, your customers are your chief guides in setting up and running your startup. Never forget that. Got it? Good.
