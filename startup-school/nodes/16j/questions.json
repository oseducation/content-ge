    "question": "How does the 'bottom-up' approach to setting goals differ from the 'top-down' approach?",
    "choices": [{
        "choice": "It focuses on the financial goals only.",
        "is_right_choice": false
    }, {
        "choice": "It starts with small, achievable targets and expands them into broader goals.",
        "is_right_choice": true

        "choice": "It disregards weekly targets and aims directly for long-term objectives.",
        "is_right_choice": false
    }, {
        "choice": "It recommends setting goals without considering the startup's current resources.",
        "is_right_choice": false
    }],
    "explanation": "The 'bottom-up' approach to goal setting is characterized by starting from what is immediately achievable or can be expected in the short term, and then expanding these achievements into broader, long-term goals. This is in contrast to the 'top-down' approach, which begins with the end goal in mind and works backward."
