## Qualifying Customers and Using Sales Tools in a Startup Environment

Alright, my friend, let's talk about reaching out to your potential customers, something crucial for your startup.

The first thing we are going to discuss is "qualifying your customers". This is a term we use to mean figuring out who might actually buy what you're offering. We need to make sure we're spending time talking to the right people during our first call because time is everything in a startup. 

So, **how do we do that?** Well, the good news is there's a boatload of helpful tools and gizmos at your fingertips. There are quite a lot of them around, but I’d like to share some that I really fancy.

- [**apollo.io**](http://apollo.io/): This one is your personal assistant in connecting with the right people.
- [**close.com**](http://close.com/) (it used to be called 'closed.io'): A simple-to-use tool that helps you keep track of your sales. 
- [**pipedrive**](http://pipedrive.com/): Another great sales tracker, but with a lot of extra bells and whistles.
- [**hunter.io**](http://hunter.io/): This one's pretty special. It allows you to pull up contact details from LinkedIn, allowing you to reach out to the right kind of people directly via email.

Now, if you're after some extra know-how, you may want to check out the book "**Founding Sales**''. It's a pretty neat read, and handy for those who want to delve a little deeper into the subject. A cool online resource I’m quite partial to is [**Lenny's Newsletter**](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com), which shares updates on all the latest happenings in the startup world.

Here's a pro tip, friend: you never learn less - so make sure you always continue to grow and evolve with your business. Happy selling!
