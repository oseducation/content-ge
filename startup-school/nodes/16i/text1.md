## Setting Targets and Optimizing Growth for Startups

So, first of all, let's talk about **what KPIs are**. KPI stands for "Key Performance Indicator". Basically, they're the things you track to figure out if you're making progress. You have your big KPI, let's call it your "primary KPI", and then you have smaller, secondary KPIs. They’re just as important but, they support your main goal, which is identified by your primary KPI.

Now, you might be asking, **"How do I choose my KPIs?"** Well, if you’re a startup, chances are growth might be your main goal. But how much growth is enough? What number should you be shooting for? That depends on your business type and where you're currently at in your journey.

Paul Graham, a really smart person in the tech world, wrote about growth, and she suggested that for a blossoming business, a weekly growth of 5-7% is great, and a juicy 10% growth is smashing. Small wins? They stack up! So take note: **Early growth is super important and lays the foundation **for your business's future**. 

Next, let's talk about things that might make your growth go faster or slower:

1. **Latent Demand:** There might be a bunch of people who need what you're offering so much that they'll use your service or product even if it's not perfect yet. This might give your early growth a sweet boost!

2. **Sales Cycle:** If you're in a business where selling takes a long time, this might slow your early growth. Even so, while your end sale might take a while, you can still measure and set targets for other steps in your sales process.

3. **Paying to Get Users:** If you're paying to bring in users using ads, you might see faster growth. But be careful, this strategy can be expensive and should be tested thoroughly before being implemented widely.

Watch out for **retention and engagement**. In other words, keep your customers interested and keep them using your product. The more your client sticks around, the more valuable they become. And the more they talk about your product to others, the more new clients you get!

And finally, we need to talk about this: Should you chase new clients or keep the old ones happy?  
Guess what? You've got to do **both**! Look after your existing clients, make sure they're happy, and at the same time, bring in new ones.

A great real-life example is Super Daily. They first tracked sign-ups but soon realized it’s easy to trick this number with paid promos. So they moved their focus to track customers who made more than five orders. They found that these customers were more likely to stick around for the long term which in turn helped their revenue growth.

So, **when you're setting targets**, you can be very specific and set numbers, like "10% growth every week." Or, you can also use more general goals that still help guide your team in the right direction. Play around with these strategies or even better, use both approaches.

Phew! That was a lot, but I hope it helps you better understand how to set targets and grow your startup effectively!
