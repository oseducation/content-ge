## Using Referrals and Virality for User Acquisition in Startups

Today, we're going to explore a very useful way that start-ups can get new users, called referrals and virality. Sounds a little fancy, doesn't it? Don't worry about it, we'll break it all down.

Let’s start with **referrals**. This is fancy-speak for when people tell their friends about something they like. Think of it like this. You're at a party and your friend tells you about this great new book they've read. That's a referral. Now, how do we take this simple idea and make it work for us in the tech world? Well, we give people a little encouragement to spread the word. For example, Airbnb, a place where people rent out their homes to travelers, gives you $40 if you get a friend to sign up. Once that friend signs up, you get $20. Sounds simple, right?

But hold on, it’s not all so easy and straightforward. There are many steps and things you have to think about when you create what's known as a **referral product**. Like, what's the offer going to be? How many people will send invites to their friends? How many of those friends will click the invite? How many will sign up? And of all those who sign up, how many will actually use your service? Each of these questions is like a step on a staircase and if any one of these steps is slippery, your friends might take a tumble. 

Let's focus on a single step here, the **referral invite email**. It's a big one. How many times have you gotten an email offering you something and just deleted it? Probably a lot, right? So how do you make sure that your invite email doesn't end up in the trash bin? 

- First, make sure that the email comes from someone they know. So if I invite my friends, the email will say it's from me, not from Airbnb! 
- Make the value crystal clear from the start. Don't bury the juicy part in a wall of words!
- Then, give them an end date to use the offer. This creates a sense of urgency.
- Make it sound special like they've been chosen for this. They're not just signing up, they're accepting an invitation!
- Finally, for that extra layer of trust and credibility, you can show some **social proof**. This could be as simple as showing how long I've been a member of the service.

There you have it! Using referrals and virality isn’t as intimidating as it sounds, is it? So go out there, and start spreading the word!
