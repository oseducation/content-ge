## Great leaders have Good Judgement About People

Let's break down the **importance of understanding people** and making sound decisions about them in running your startup journey. Remember, your startup is like a team on a ship, and the crew you choose significantly impacts the voyage.

So, let's start with why is it important to have good judgment about people. Well, simply put, as your startup grows, you can't do everything alone, and you'll have to bring other people on board. These people will step into leadership roles, like managers, directors, and maybe vice presidents. They'll become your arms and legs, helping carry out your vision. That's why it's crucial that you choose the right people to empower. Because, if the ones you trust fumble, it can shake the faith your team has in you. 

Now, onto the million-dollar question - **how do you get good at this?** Well, some folks have a natural knack for understanding people, but if you're not one of them, don't worry! You can develop this skill too. Here's a tip - whenever you're hiring for any role in your company, take your time. Speak to lots of people, even those you don't immediately feel compelled to hire. These chats can show you what outstanding leaders, ace engineers, or stellar sales leaders are like. Ask them about their career journey, their leadership styles, their triumphs and challenges. This will gradually sharpen your judgement.

Also, don't hesitate to meet with people just because you think you won't hire them. Treat every interaction as a learning experience. You know, the first time hiring a CFO can be rather daunting. Avoid rushing the process; take time to meet people and trust your instincts.

Let's face it, you'll have to hire many people as you expand. Some hires will be hits, others, not so much. Remember, hiring isn't a simple in-and-out process. Instead, see it as a learning journey. Reflect on each hire - think about why you chose them, what worked, what didn't, and how they fit into your company.

Understanding **people and their potential** is not something you can overlook as your startup takes off. Take your time, trust your gut instincts, and learn from your experiences to ensure you empower the right people in your organization.
