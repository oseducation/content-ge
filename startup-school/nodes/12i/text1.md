## Conducting MVP Prototyping Sessions


Let's talk about how to sell your product to your target audience. Guess what? You don't have to wait for a finished product to start pitching your idea! A *Minimum Viable Product* or **MVP** can be just a simple example of what the finished product might look like.

### Using a Design Prototype

We don't have to get technical right away. Even something as basic as a design prototype â€“ created in a tool like *Envision* or something similar - can give your potential customers an idea of what the final product will look like. 
At Airbnb they used the easiest way - they would simply walk downstairs to their office, find someone who was waiting for a coffee or an interview, and show them the newest version of their planned app.

### Handling the Prototype: The Key Notes

Here you need to focus on the most critical part. **Don't tell** them what to do with the prototype. Let them explore. Give them a gentle push, perhaps a basic task, something like "try to book a room on Airbnb" or "search for dates", but don't guide them on how to achieve it step by step. 

Remember, if this was a real product, you wouldn't be standing next to them to assist, would you?

### Making the Most out of User Experience

A neat trick to get the most out of this experience? Ask them to voice their thoughts while they use the prototype. Ask them to explain what they're thinking at each step, which words they understand, which they don't, or what they believe a specific screen or feature is meant for.

By doing this, you get to understand your potential users better and refine your product to suit their needs and expectations. 

And that's it! Testing your MVP this way can bring you closer to a product that really meets the needs of your target audience. Do remember, that it may take several rounds and iterations, but with each step, you will be moving closer to a successful product. I hope this has been helpful. Happy experimenting!
