## Understanding the Challenges of an Advertising Business Model

Let's talk about why only a small number of businesses actually hit the big time using an advertising model. Now, this might be surprising because we hear about big names like Google, Facebook, and Twitter that have nailed this model. But, did you know that only 3% of the top 100 startups, from the well-known startup incubator, Y Combinator, have primarily used advertising to make money? 

Why? Well, for a business model based on advertising to work well, the company needs to be super popular - we're talking lightning in a bottle level of popularity. It's important that your startup becomes the cool place where everyone wants to hang out online, like how Twitch became the go-to place for watching live streams, or Reddit developed into the heart of numerous online communities. 

Now, when this kind of popularity happens, companies enjoy something we call **network effects**. This just means people come to your site because everyone else they know is already there. Think of it like a party â€“ people come and stay because all their friends are there. 

But remember, planning to earn primarily from ads should only be your choice if you really believe that your startup can rank among the top 10 sites on the internet. If not, monetizing the business and growing it big can be tough using this model. 

So, what's the takeaway? Choose your startup's business model wisely. It's not always about following in the footsteps of the big names but rather, choosing what works best for your specific business idea.
