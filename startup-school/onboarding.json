    "question_type": "multiple_choice",
    "explanation": "Service- or consultant-based enterprises, affiliate marketing businesses, hardware businesses, and businesses built on other platforms are not typically found among the top 100 companies. These types of businesses face significant challenges in scaling, such as constantly needing new customers, relying on other people's transactions, requiring large upfront investments, and depending on platforms owned by others. In contrast, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies are not having these inherent scaling challenges and are often found among top-performing businesses due to their recurring revenue models and scalability",
