Sure! Let's talk through this step by step in simpler words:

Imagine we have a newborn calf that weighs 40 kilograms. Each week, its weight increases by 5%. We want to know if the weight $$W$$ in kilograms after $$t$$ weeks is a linear function or an exponential function. 

If $$W$$ were a linear function, it would mean that the weight increases by the same amount every week. For example, if it increased by 5 kilograms every week, it would be linear. But that's not what's happening here.

Instead, the calf's weight increases by 5% each week. After one week, the weight will be $$1.05 \times 40$$ kilograms. After another week, it will be $$1.05$$ times that new weight, meaning another 5% more. This keeps happening, so the weight is really $$40 \times 1.05^t$$. We’re multiplying by 1.05 each week, not just adding a constant amount. This tells us that the function is exponential. 

Given choices, the correct description would be: “This function is exponential because $$W$$ increases by a factor of 1.05 each time $$t$$ increases by 1.”

Let’s look at another example.

Fidel has a rare coin worth $550, and each year its value increases by 10%. Like the calf, we’re increasing by a factor of 1.1 each year. This is exponential again. If the value increased by a fixed $10 each year, it would be linear, but we're talking about a percentage increase.

Here’s one more example.

Your uncle bought a car for 130,000 Mexican pesos. Each year, its value decreases by 10,000 pesos. This time, we’re subtracting a fixed amount every year. After one year, it's 120,000 pesos, after two years it's 110,000 pesos, and so on. This describes a linear situation because we’re decreasing by a constant amount each year.

Next, consider the number of wild hogs in Arkansas increasing by a factor of 3 every 5 years. We are multiplying the number of hogs by 3 every 5 years, not just adding 3 more hogs. This definitely makes it exponential.

Finally, let’s say you work as a waiter and earn $50 in tips every day you work. This is clearly linear because each day you earn a fixed amount of $50. Work one day, earn $50. Work two days, earn $100. You're not earning a percentage more each day, just a fixed amount.
