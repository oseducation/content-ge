Hey there! Let's break this down together. You might already know a bit about linear equations. Any linear equation can be put in the form $$y = mx + b$$, where $$m$$ is the slope of the line. The slope is how much the line rises or falls as you move along the x-axis. And $$b$$ is the y-intercept, which is where the line crosses the y-axis.

To see why $$b$$ is the y-intercept, we can substitute $$x = 0$$ into the equation. That gives us:

$$ y = m \cdot 0 + b $$

$$m \cdot 0$$ is just 0, so:

$$ y = b $$

This shows that the point $$(0, b)$$ is on the line. So, when $$x$$ is 0, $$y$$ is $$b$$, meaning the line cuts the y-axis at $$b$$.

Now, let's check if $$m$$ really is the slope. We know the point $$(0, b)$$ is on the line. If $$x = 1$$, the equation becomes:

$$ y = m \cdot 1 + b = m + b $$

So, the point $$(1, m + b)$$ is also on the line. The slope $$m$$ is the change in y over the change in x:

$$ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{(m + b) - b}{1 - 0} = \frac{m}{1} = m $$

Hopefully, this makes sense! Now, let's apply this to some actual graphs and figure out the equations of different lines by determining their slopes and y-intercepts.

Starting with line $$A$$:
- Pick some easy points to work with. If you move $$3$$ steps to the right (delta $$x = 3$$), you go down $$2$$ steps (delta $$y = -2$$).
- So, the slope $$m$$ is $$ \frac{-2}{3} $$.
- Now, find the y-intercept. If you follow the line, you find it crosses the y-axis at roughly $$(0, \frac{4}{3})$$.
- Therefore, the equation for line $$A$$ is $$ y = \frac{-2}{3}x + \frac{4}{3} $$.

Next, line $$B$$:
- Move 1 step right (delta $$x = 1$$) and 3 steps up (delta $$y = 3$$).
- The slope $$m$$ is $$3$$.
- The y-intercept is at $$(0, 1)$$.
- So, the equation for line $$B$$ is $$ y = 3x + 1 $$.

And for line $$C$$:
- The y-intercept is at $$(0, -2)$$.
- Moving 4 steps right (delta $$x = 4$$) and 2 steps up (delta $$y = 2$$), the slope $$m$$ is $$ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $$.
- The equation for line $$C$$ is $$ y = \frac{1}{2}x - 2 $$.

Now, let's do it the other way around by graphing lines from their equations.

First, $$ y = 2x + 5 $$:
- The y-intercept is at $$(0, 5)$$.
- The slope is $$2$$, so for every step right, go 2 steps up.
- Connect these points to draw the line.

Next, $$ y = -\frac{1}{5}x + 7 $$:
- Y-intercept at $$(0, 7)$$.
- The slope is $$ -\frac{1}{5} $$: for every 5 steps right, go 1 step down.
- Connect these points for the line.

For $$ y = -x $$:
- The y-intercept is $$(0, 0)$$.
- The slope is $$-1$$: for each step right, go one step down.
- Draw this line.

Finally, $$ y = 3.75 $$:
- The y-intercept is at $$(0, 3.75)$$.
- The slope is 0, which means it's just a horizontal line at $$ y = 3.75 $$.

I hope this makes things clearer! Keep practicing and it will get even easier. Let me know if you have any questions!
