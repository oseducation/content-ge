Sure, let's break it down together! 

Let's talk about the temperature, which we'll call $$T(t)$$, in New York City. Here, $$T$$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius, and lowercase $$t$$ represents the hours after midnight on a certain day. 

We're looking at a graph of this function. There's also a table with some true statements about the temperature. We'll match these statements to the graph. 

At $$t = 0$$ hours (midnight), the temperature is -3 degrees Celsius. Eight hours later, at $$t = 8$$ (8 AM), the temperature reaches 0 degrees Celsius. The temperature then continues to rise, hitting a high point at $$t = 14$$ (2 PM). After that, the temperature starts to drop again. 

So, when we talk about different times: 
- $$t = 0$$ is midnight,
- $$t = 8$$ is 8 AM,
- $$t = 12$$ is noon,
- $$t = 14$$ is 2 PM,
- etc.

The Y-intercept of a graph is where it crosses the vertical axis. Here, it shows the temperature at midnight, which is -3 degrees Celsius. So, at the start of the day, New York City was -3 degrees Celsius. That matches one of the statements.

Next, we look at the "positive or negative interval." This tells us if the temperature was above or below zero. From midnight to 8 AM, the temperature was below zero (negative). From 8 AM to 8 PM, the temperature was above zero (positive). This means the temperature stayed above zero between 8 AM and 8 PM. That's another statement we can match.

Finally, let's consider the "increasing or decreasing interval." This tells us if the temperature was rising or falling. From 2 AM to 2 PM, the temperature increases as time goes on. So, it was getting warmer from 2 AM to 2 PM. This matches the last statement.

In summary:
- The Y-intercept at $$t = 0$$ shows -3 degrees Celsius at midnight.
- The positive interval from 8 AM to 8 PM shows the temperature above zero.
- The increasing interval from 2 AM to 2 PM shows the temperature rising.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
