Sure, let’s go through this together!

Teresa went skydiving. The graph below shows Teresa's height in meters as a function of time in seconds. So let's look at this graph. It’s pretty big, so I’ll zoom out a bit. 

At time zero, her height is 700 meters. As time goes forward (to the right), her height decreases. The rate at which her height drops gets faster and faster until she reaches 10 seconds. Then, suddenly, the rate of decrease slows down, though she’s still getting lower, just more slowly. It makes sense that she deploys her parachute at this point, around 10 seconds.

Now, let’s see what the question is asking. They ask us to complete the sentence: “Between 3 seconds and 8 seconds after Teresa jumped, her height decreased, on average, by approximately ___ meters per second."

First, let’s find her height at 3 seconds. Looking at the graph, her height at 3 seconds seems to be around halfway between 600 and 700 meters, so let’s say it’s about 650 meters.

Next, we look at her height at 8 seconds. It appears to be about halfway between 350 and 400 meters, so let’s say it’s approximately 375 meters.

To find the average rate of change, we need to calculate the slope of the line that connects these two points. The slope formula is:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{\text{change in height}}{\text{change in time}}
$$

Her change in height from 8 seconds to 3 seconds is:

$$
H(8) - H(3) = 375 - 650 = -275 \text{ meters}
$$

The change in time is:

$$
8 - 3 = 5 \text{ seconds}
$$

So, her average rate of change is:

$$
\frac{-275 \text{ meters}}{5 \text{ seconds}} = -55 \text{ meters per second}
$$

Since the rate of decline is already accounted for by the negative sign, it means her height is decreasing by 55 meters per second. 

Thus, the sentence should be completed as: “Between 3 seconds and 8 seconds after Teresa jumped, her height decreased, on average, by approximately 55 meters per second.”

I hope this makes sense! If you have any questions or need more help, feel free to ask!
