Sure! Let's break this down step by step together. You're wondering what happens if you add a rational number to an irrational number. Will the result be rational or irrational? Let's figure this out.

First, let's imagine the result is a rational number and see if that makes sense. So, suppose we have a rational number, which we can write as a fraction $$\frac{a}{b}$$ where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are integers (whole numbers). Let's call the irrational number $$x$$. If we add them together, we get another number. 

Now, let's assume this new number is rational too, which we can write as a fraction $$\frac{m}{n}$$ where $$m$$ and $$n$$ are also integers.

So, we have:
$$\frac{a}{b} + x = \frac{m}{n}$$

If we subtract $$\frac{a}{b}$$ from both sides, we get:
$$x = \frac{m}{n} - \frac{a}{b}$$

Next, let's get a common denominator for these fractions to combine them. The common denominator would be $$b \cdot n$$:
$$x = \frac{m \cdot b - n \cdot a}{n \cdot b}$$

Here, $$m \cdot b$$ and $$n \cdot a$$ are both integers, and $$n \cdot b$$ is an integer too. So, the numerator (top part) and the denominator (bottom part) are both integers, meaning $$x$$ can be written as a fraction of two integers.

Now, here's the contradiction: we assumed $$x$$ was irrational, but we just showed it can be written as a fraction, which means it is rational. That doesn't make sense because we know $$x$$ is irrational.

So, our initial assumption that the result is rational must be wrong. Therefore, if you add a rational number to an irrational number, the result must be irrational.

To summarize:
A rational number plus an irrational number must be irrational.
