Hey there! Let's go through this Math problem together. It's from Khan Academy and involves Mason on a ladder. Here's the scenario:

- Mason is standing on the 5th step of a ladder that has 15 steps.
- Each step is 0.5 meters apart.
- Mason can move up, down, or stay where he is.

Let's draw this ladder to make it clearer. Imagine a vertical ladder with 15 steps. The distance between each step is 0.5 meters. Mason is currently on the 5th step. 

Now, let's talk about the height function, $$ h(n) $$, which represents Mason's height above the ground after moving $$ n $$ steps. If Mason moves down, $$ n $$ is negative. 

1. If Mason doesn't move at all ($$ h(0) $$), he's still on the 5th step. Each step is 0.5 meters, so $$ 5 \times 0.5 = 2.5 $$ meters above the ground. So, $$ h(0) = 2.5 $$ meters.
2. If Mason moves up one step ($$ h(1) $$), he's on the 6th step. The height would be $$ 6 \times 0.5 = 3 $$ meters. So, $$ h(1) = 3 $$ meters.

Now, let's discuss the domain of the function. The domain is the set of possible inputs (values of $$ n $$) for the function $$ h(n) $$. Mason can only move whole steps, either up or down, so $$ n $$ must be an integer. He can't move half a step, or $$ \pi $$ steps, or $$ \sqrt{2} $$ steps, because those aren't whole steps.

Next, we define the interval for $$ n $$:

1. The lowest step Mason can go down to is the ground level, which is 5 steps down from his starting position on the 5th step. So, $$ n $$ can be as low as $$ -5 $$.
2. The highest step Mason can move up to is the top of the ladder, which is 10 steps up from the 5th step. So, $$ n $$ can be as high as $$ +10 $$.

Therefore, the interval for $$ n $$ is from $$ -5 $$ to $$ 10 $$, inclusive. We write this interval using brackets: $$ [-5, 10] $$.

In the exercise, you would select "integers" for the domain type and set the interval from $$ -5 $$ to $$ 10 $$ to get the correct answer.

Great job working through this problem! Keep practicing, and you'll get even better at understanding how to work with functions and their domains.
