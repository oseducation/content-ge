Sure, let's break it down together! Imagine you're sitting at a cozy café in Paris with a friend. You notice a local ahead of you pays 5.30 Euros ($5) for a cup of coffee and a croissant. When you and your friend order two cups of coffee and two croissants, you get charged 14 Euros. It makes you wonder if we can figure out the prices of one cup of coffee and one croissant.

To solve this, let's use a system of equations. We'll use $$x$$ to represent the price of a cup of coffee and $$y$$ to represent the price of a croissant.

From the local’s purchase:
1. One cup of coffee and one croissant costs 5.30 Euros.
   That gives us the equation: $$x + y = 5.30$$

For your purchase:
2. Two cups of coffee and two croissants cost 14 Euros.
   That gives us another equation: $$2x + 2y = 14$$

We now have a system of equations:

1. $$x + y = 5.30$$
2. $$2x + 2y = 14$$

To solve these, let's simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:

$$x + y = 7$$ (after dividing the second equation by 2)

Now, we have:

1. $$x + y = 5.30$$
2. $$x + y = 7$$

This shows something interesting: the same combination (one cup of coffee and one croissant) cannot equal two different amounts—5.30 Euros and 7 Euros at the same time. This means there’s a discrepancy.

To see this mathematically, let's subtract the first equation from the second:

$$(x + y) - (x + y) = 7 - 5.30$$
This simplifies to:

$$0 = 1.70$$

Since 0 cannot equal 1.70, this tells us there's no solution that fits both equations at the same time. The best explanation here is that the local got a cheaper rate for their coffee and croissant compared to what you were charged.

So, the math shows us quite clearly that you were charged more—maybe a tourist rate!
