Sure! Let's work through this together in a simpler way.

We want to find the height and base of a triangle. We know two things:
1. The height is 4 inches less than the base.
2. The area of the triangle is 30 square inches.

We'll use the formula for the area of a triangle:
$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} $$

Let’s call the base $$ b $$ and the height $$ h $$. Since the height is 4 inches less than the base, we can say:
$$ h = b - 4 $$

We know the area is 30 square inches, so we can write:
$$ 30 = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h $$

Now, substitute $$ h $$ with $$ b - 4 $$:
$$ 30 = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times (b - 4) $$

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
$$ 60 = b \times (b - 4) $$

This simplifies to:
$$ 60 = b^2 - 4b $$

We now have a quadratic equation. To solve it, rearrange it to equal 0:
$$ b^2 - 4b - 60 = 0 $$

We need to factor this quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to -60 and add to -4. The numbers are 6 and -10. So we can write:
$$ (b + 6)(b - 10) = 0 $$

Setting each factor to zero gives us:
$$ b + 6 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad b - 10 = 0 $$

So,
$$ b = -6 \quad \text{or} \quad b = 10 $$

Since a length can't be negative, we ignore $$ b = -6 $$. Therefore, the base $$ b = 10 $$ inches.

We know the height is 4 inches less than the base, so:
$$ h = b - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 $$ inches.

Therefore, the base is 10 inches and the height is 6 inches.

Let’s check this. The area should be:
$$ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 6 = 30 \, \text{square inches} $$

Everything checks out! Great job!
