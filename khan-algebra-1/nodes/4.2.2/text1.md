Hey there! Let's talk about slope and how we measure it. The slope is basically how much something goes up or down as you move sideways. We use a little triangle called delta (âˆ†) to mean "change in."

To find the slope, we look at the change in the vertical direction (up or down) and divide it by the change in the horizontal direction (side to side). This is a simple way to see how steep a line is.

So, let's say we're looking at a graph with an $$xy$$ plane. The change in the vertical direction is a change in the $$y$$ value, and the change in the horizontal direction is a change in the $$x$$ value. That's why we say the slope $$=\frac{{\Delta y}}{{\Delta x}}$$.

Imagine you have a line with a slope of 1. This means for every 1 step you take to the right (increasing $$x$$ by 1), you also go up 1 step (increasing $$y$$ by 1). It would look like this:

\[
\text{If } \Delta x = 2, \Delta y = 2 \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
\]

Now, what if the slope is 2? It should be steeper. For every 1 step you take to the right, you go up 2 steps. It looks like this:

\[
\text{If } \Delta x = 1, \Delta y = 2 \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
\]

Now let's talk about a negative slope. A negative slope means that as you move to the right, you go down instead of up. For example, if the slope is -1, for every 1 step to the right, you go down 1 step. It looks like this:

\[
\text{If } \Delta x = 1, \Delta y = -1 \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-1}{1} = -1
\]

If the slope is -2, it's even steeper going down. For every 1 step to the right, you go down 2 steps. It looks like this:

\[
\text{If } \Delta x = 1, \Delta y = -2 \Rightarrow \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-2}{1} = -2
\]

So, the bigger the slope, the steeper the line. If the slope is positive, the line goes up as you move right. If it's negative, the line goes down as you move right. I hope this helps you understand slope better!
