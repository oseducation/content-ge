Hey there! Let's look at this quadratic expression: $$X^2 + 16X + 9$$. We want to change it into a different but useful form. You might wonder, why bother? Well, it's good math practice and helps us with something important called "completing the square." This will also help us understand the quadratic formula later on.

So, how do we change $$X^2 + 16X + 9$$ into the form $$(X + A)^2 + B$$? Let's start by breaking it down.

First, remember if we expand $$(X + A)^2$$, we get:
$$(X + A)^2 = X^2 + 2AX + A^2$$,
and then we have a $$+ B$$ added at the end.

We want $$X^2 + 16X + 9$$ to look like that. So, let's write it with a bit more space:
$$X^2 + 16X + 9$$.

Now, let’s match things up. If $$2AX = 16X$$, what’s $$A$$? Well, $$2A = 16$$, so $$A = 8$$. 

We need $$A^2$$ here, which is $$8^2 = 64$$. But we can’t just add 64 out of nowhere. To keep the expression the same, we also subtract 64.

So, let's rewrite our expression like this:
$$X^2 + 16X + 9 + 64 - 64$$.

Now, let's focus on the part that looks like $$(X + A)^2$$:
$$X^2 + 16X + 64$$
This fits the pattern of $$(X + 8)^2$$ because $$A = 8$$.

What about the $$9 - 64$$ part? That’s:
$$9 - 64 = -55$$.

So, we end up with:
$$(X + 8)^2 - 55$$.

And there you go! We’ve rewritten $$X^2 + 16X + 9$$ as $$(X + 8)^2 - 55$$, which is also known as "completing the square." Great job!
