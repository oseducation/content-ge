Sure, let's work through this together! We're trying to find which expressions match $$x + 2 - y + x + 2$$. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let’s rewrite the expression: $$x + 2 - y + x + 2$$. 

When I look at this, I see I have an $$x$$ here and another $$x$$ there. If I add these together, I get $$2x$$. So, let’s rewrite it with these two $$x$$ terms combined:

$$x + x + 2 - y + 2$$

Now, combining the $$x$$ terms gives us:

$$2x + 2 - y + 2$$

Next, let’s put the constants (the numbers) together too. The $$2$$ and $$2$$ add up to $$4$$:

$$2x - y + 4$$

Now, let's see if any of the given choices match this. 

- The first choice is $$2x + 4y + 4$$. This doesn’t match because we have $$2x - y + 4$$.
  
- Another given choice looks like they factored out a $$2$$. Let's see if we can do that to our simplified expression $$2x - y + 4$$. We see that a $$2$$ is a factor of both $$2x$$ and $$4$$. So:

$$2(x - y/2 + 2)$$

But, this doesn't look like any of our original options. 

Finally, we saw another option which was $$2(x + 2 - y/2)$$. Let's check:

$$2(x + 2 - y/2)$$

Upon closer look, this rearranges to $$2x + 4 - y$$, which might just be matching another provided option.

Therefore, for the final expression, one correct transformation is:

$$2(x - y / 2 + 2)$$

By matching, it simplifies to:

$$2x - y + 4$$, which represents the transformed $$2x - y + 4$$.

And above all, we learn the importance of simplifying effectively. If stuck, retrace steps, managing constants and combined factors adds precision to solutions. Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of simplifying expressions!
