Sure! Let's go over this together.

First, we have a function, which we'll call $$f(x)$$, and it's shown on a graph. We need to find what $$f$$ of negative 1 is, written as $$f(-1)$$.

We use the graph to understand our function. The graph shows us what the function gives us for different $$x$$ values. Now, we need to see what happens when $$x = -1$$.

On the graph, we locate the point where $$x = -1$$. We see that at this point, the graph reaches a value of 6. So, the output of our function when $$x = -1$$ is 6.

We can write this as $$f(-1) = 6$$.

There you go! $$f(-1) = 6$$ is our answer.
