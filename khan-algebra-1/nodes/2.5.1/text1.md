Hi! Let's work on solving for \( p \) in the inequality \(-3p - 7 < p + 9\). Our goal is to get \( p \) by itself on one side of the inequality, preferably the left side, just to make it easier to read. Here’s how we can do this step by step:

First, we need to get rid of the \( p \) on the right-hand side. To do this, we'll subtract \( p \) from both sides:

$$
-3p - 7 - p < p + 9 - p
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
-4p - 7 < 9
$$

Next, we want to get rid of the \(-7\) on the left side, so we'll add \( 7 \) to both sides:

$$
-4p - 7 + 7 < 9 + 7
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
-4p < 16
$$

Now, we need to get rid of the \(-4\) that’s multiplied by \( p \). The best way to do this is to divide both sides by \(-4\). Remember, when we divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the inequality sign:

$$
\frac{-4p}{-4} > \frac{16}{-4}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
p > -4
$$

So, the solution to the inequality is \( p > -4 \).

Let's plot this on the number line to better understand it. Imagine a number line with numbers like \(-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0\). Our solution doesn't include \(-4\) (so we’ll leave an open circle at \(-4\)), but includes every number greater than \(-4\) (indicated by an arrow moving to the right).

Now, to make sure our solution is correct, let's test some values:

1. Try \( p = -3 \) (which is in our solution set):

$$
-3(-3) - 7 < -3 + 9
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
9 - 7 < 6 \Rightarrow 2 < 6 \, \text{(True!)}
$$

2. Try \( p = -5 \) (which is not in our solution set):

$$
-3(-5) - 7 < -5 + 9
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
15 - 7 < 4 \Rightarrow 8 < 4 \, \text{(False!)}
$$

Finally, let's check the boundary point \( p = -4 \). Plugging it into the original inequality:

$$
-3(-4) - 7 < -4 + 9
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
12 - 7 < 5 \Rightarrow 5 < 5 \, \text{(False!)}
$$

So, \( p = -4 \) doesn’t work for the inequality but satisfies the boundary condition perfectly.

We’ve confirmed that \( p > -4 \) is indeed our correct solution!
