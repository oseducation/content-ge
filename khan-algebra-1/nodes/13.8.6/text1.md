Sure! Let's break this down step by step to make it easier to understand.

So we have two quadratic expressions: $4x^2 + 12x + 9$ and $4x^2 - 9$. They share a common binomial factor. Let’s figure out what that common factor is. Feel free to pause and try it on your own first!

First, let's look at $4x^2 + 12x + 9$:

1. Notice the $4$ in front of $x^2$. $4$ is a perfect square ($2^2$).
2. Notice the $9$ at the end. $9$ is also a perfect square ($3^2$).

So, we can rewrite the expression:

$$4x^2 + 12x + 9 = (2x)^2 + 2 \cdot 2x \cdot 3 + 3^2$$

We wanted to check if this fits the pattern of a perfect square trinomial, and it does. When we have:

$$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$

Here, $a = 2x$ and $b = 3$, so it matches perfectly. 

This means:

$$4x^2 + 12x + 9 = (2x + 3)^2$$

Now, let's look at the second expression: $4x^2 - 9$.

This looks like a difference of squares. A difference of squares has the form:

$$a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)$$

Here:

$$4x^2 - 9 = (2x)^2 - 3^2$$

So, it can be factored as:

$$(2x + 3)(2x - 3)$$

Now, let’s see the factors:

- For $4x^2 + 12x + 9$, we have $(2x + 3)^2$.
- For $4x^2 - 9$, we have $(2x + 3)(2x - 3)$.

Both expressions have the common binomial factor $(2x + 3)$.

So, the common binomial factor is:

$$2x + 3$$
