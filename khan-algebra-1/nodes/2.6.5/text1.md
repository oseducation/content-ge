Hey there! Let's dive into some compound inequality problems. These problems just have more than one rule to follow. You'll see what I mean in a bit. 

First problem: 
$$-5 \leq x - 4 \leq 13$$

This means there are two rules for $$x$$. We can split it into:
$$-5 \leq x - 4$$ 
and 
$$x - 4 \leq 13$$

To solve each part, we treat them separately but remember to combine the results at the end. Let's start with:
$$-5 \leq x - 4$$ 
Add 4 to both sides:
$$-5 + 4 \leq x$$ 
which simplifies to:
$$-1 \leq x$$

Now for the second part:
$$x - 4 \leq 13$$ 
Add 4 to both sides:
$$x \leq 13 + 4$$ 
which simplifies to:
$$x \leq 17$$

So, combining both parts:
$$-1 \leq x \leq 17$$

If we put this on a number line, it looks like this:
- From -1 to 17, including both -1 and 17.

In interval notation:
$$x \in [-1, 17]$$

Now, letâ€™s try another one:
$$-12 < 2 - 5x \leq 7$$

First, split it again:
$$-12 < 2 - 5x$$ 
and 
$$2 - 5x \leq 7$$

For the first part:
$$-12 < 2 - 5x$$
Subtract 2 from both sides:
$$-14 < -5x$$
Divide by -5 (remember to flip the sign):
$$\frac{-14}{-5} > x$$ 
which simplifies to:
$$2.8 > x$$ 
or 
$$x < 2.8$$

For the second part:
$$2 - 5x \leq 7$$
Subtract 2 from both sides:
$$-5x \leq 5$$
Divide by -5 (flip the sign):
$$x \geq -1$$

So, combining both:
$$-1 \leq x < 2.8$$

On the number line:
- From -1 to just less than 2.8, including -1 but not 2.8.

In interval notation:
$$x \in [-1, 2.8)$$

Finally, letâ€™s look at an "or" problem:
$$4x - 1 \geq 7$$
or 
$$\frac{9x}{2} < 3$$

For the first part:
$$4x - 1 \geq 7$$ 
Add 1 to both sides:
$$4x \geq 8$$ 
Divide by 4:
$$x \geq 2$$

For the second part:
$$\frac{9x}{2} < 3$$ 
Multiply by 2/9:
$$x < \frac{6}{9}$$ 
which simplifies to:
$$x < \frac{2}{3}$$

So, we have:
$$x \geq 2$$
or
$$x < \frac{2}{3}$$

On the number line:
- From 2 onwards, including 2.
- Or less than 2/3.

In interval notation:
$$x \in [2, \infty)$$
or
$$x \in (-\infty, \frac{2}{3})$$

I hope this makes everything clearer for you! Let me know if you have any questions or if you want to try another problem. ðŸ˜Š
