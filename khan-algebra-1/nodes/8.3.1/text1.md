Hey there! I’m happy to help answer your question. I'm going to break down some interesting thoughts from a chat between Salman Khan and Jesse Roe. Jesse teaches algebra, geometry, and algebra II. He spent some time in the summer helping with new content and exercises on a learning site.

One question Jesse often gets from his algebra students is: "What's the difference between an equation and a function?" It’s a great question and Salman Khan had some thoughts on this. Let’s dig in!

When thinking about equations and functions, there are some important things to understand. 

**Equations**:
- An equation is like a statement that says two things are equal. For example, $$x + 3 = 10$$.
- In this example, we aren’t talking about inputs and outputs or how one thing depends on another. We’re just stating that "if you add 3 to $$x$$, you get 10.”

**Functions**:
- A function, on the other hand, talks about relationships between variables. It’s like a rule that says, "If you give me an input, I’ll give you exactly one output."
- We can show a function in many ways. For instance, by using a graph or by other means like making a table.

Here’s a quick drawing of a function as a graph:
- Let’s say we have some $$x$$ values like 1, 2, 3, and on the vertical axis, we show the function values (which we’ll call $$f(x)$$). We can even mark where $$x = 2$$ and see what $$f(x)$$ equals at that point.

There are also different ways to show a function, like in computer code:
- Imagine a program where you input a day of the week, and it outputs what you’re eating that day. If you input "Monday," it might output "cereal." If it’s not Monday, it might output "meatloaf."

**Mixing Equations and Functions**:
- Sometimes, you can use an equation to define a function. For instance: 
$$	y = 4x - 10	$$
- Here, for any value of $$x$$ you plug in, the equation gives you a corresponding $$y$$ value, which means this equation defines $$y$$ as a function of $$x$$.

I hope this clears things up! Remember that a function is a special kind of equation—one that makes a clear link between inputs and outputs. An equation can be part of defining that function. Happy learning!
