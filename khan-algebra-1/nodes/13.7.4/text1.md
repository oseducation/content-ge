Sure, let's go through this step-by-step. 

We're given two quadratic expressions: 
$$m^2 - 4m - 45$$ 
and 
$$6m^2 - 150$$
and we need to find a common binomial factor. Let's do this together!

First, let's start with the expression $$m^2 - 4m - 45$$.

We want to factor it into the product of two binomials. When the coefficient in front of $$m^2$$ is 1, we can use the format:
$$(m + a)(m + b)$$

Here, $$a + b$$ needs to equal the coefficient of $$-4m$$, and $$a \times b$$ needs to equal $$-45$$.

So, $$a + b = -4$$ and $$a \times b = -45$$.

Let's think about what values of $$a$$ and $$b$$ can make this true. 

If the product of two numbers is negative, one number has to be positive and the other negative. And if their sum is negative, it means the negative number has a bigger absolute value.

Let's try some pairs:
- $$(1, -45)$$ doesn't work because 1 + (-45) = -44
- $$(3, -15)$$ doesn't work because 3 + (-15) = -12
- $$(5, -9)$$ works because 5 + (-9) = -4

So, we can write $$m^2 - 4m - 45$$ as:
$$(m + 5)(m - 9)$$

Great! Now let's factor the second expression, $$6m^2 - 150$$.

First, notice that both terms are divisible by 6. So, we can factor out the 6:
$$6m^2 - 150 = 6(m^2 - 25)$$

Now, look at $$m^2 - 25$$. This is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:
$$(m + 5)(m - 5)$$

So, we get:
$$6(m^2 - 25) = 6(m + 5)(m - 5)$$

Now, let's see what common binomial factor both expressions share.

- For $$m^2 - 4m - 45$$, we factored it as $$(m + 5)(m - 9)$$.
- For $$6m^2 - 150$$, we factored it as $$6(m + 5)(m - 5)$$.

Both expressions have $$(m + 5)$$ as a common factor!

So, the binomial factor they share is:
$$(m + 5)$$
