Hey there! Let's work through finding the vertex and the axis of symmetry of a parabola together. The goal is to understand what these terms mean and how they relate to the graph.

First, let's recall what a vertex and an axis of symmetry are. For a parabola that opens upwards, the vertex is the lowest point, or the minimum. For a parabola opening downwards, the vertex is the highest point, or the maximum. The axis of symmetry is a vertical line that splits the parabola into two mirror images.

To determine if a parabola opens upwards or downwards, look at the coefficient of the $$x^2$$ term. A positive coefficient means the parabola opens upwards, while a negative coefficient means it opens downwards.

Now, let’s find the vertex using an example. At first, this might seem tricky, but we’ll take it step-by-step. We can use the method of completing the square. Although it may seem strange, let's break it down.

Given the equation:

$$y = -2x^2 + 8x - 4$$

First, factor out $$-2$$ from the $$x^2$$ and $$x$$ terms:

$$y = -2 (x^2 - 4x) - 4$$

Next, complete the square inside the parentheses. To complete the square, find the number that makes $$x^2 - 4x$$ a perfect square. This number is $$4$$ because:

$$ (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4$$

Add and subtract $$4$$ inside the parentheses:

$$y = -2 (x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4) - 4$$

This simplifies to:

$$y = -2 [(x - 2)^2 - 4] - 4$$

Distribute the $$-2$$:

$$y = -2 (x - 2)^2 + 8 - 4$$

Simplify further:

$$y = -2 (x - 2)^2 + 4$$

Now, you can see that the equation is in the form $$y = a(x - h)^2 + k$$ where \((h, k)\) is the vertex. Here, the vertex is at:

$$ (2, 4) $$

So, the vertex is at \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 4 \). 

The axis of symmetry is the line \( x = 2 \).

To finalize, if you ever need a quick shortcut, use the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:

$$x = \frac{-b}{2a}$$

Given our original equation:

$$ y = -2x^2 + 8x - 4 $$

Here, \( a = -2 \), and \( b = 8 \). Plugging these in:

$$ x = \frac{-8}{2(-2)} = \frac{-8}{-4} = 2 $$

So, when \( x = 2 \), \( y \) is \( 16 \) when put back into the equation.

Hope that helps clarify things!
