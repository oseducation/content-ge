Hey there! Let's get comfortable with the idea of an interval and how we can show or write an interval. Here's a number line. Imagine we're talking about the interval from -3 to 2. This means we care about all the numbers between -3 and 2. 

To be precise, we need to decide: are we including -3 and 2, or not? If we include both -3 and 2, we fill in the circles at these numbers. This is called a closed interval. 

On a number line, we show a closed interval by filling the endpoints. So, $$-3 \leq x \leq 2$$ includes both -3 and 2. Another way to write it is with brackets: $$[-3, 2]$$. These brackets tell us that we're including -3 on the left and 2 on the right.

Sometimes, we use fancy math language. We can say that $$x$$ is a member of the real numbers, written as $$x \in \mathbb{R}$$, and write $$-3 \leq x \leq 2$$ inside curly brackets like this: $$\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid -3 \leq x \leq 2 \}$$. This means we're talking about all $$x$$ values from -3 to 2, including the endpoints.

Next, let's look at an open interval. Suppose we want to show all numbers between -1 and 4, but not including -1 and 4. We use open circles on the number line for an open interval. 

So for $$-1 < x < 4$$, we don't include -1 and 4. We can also write this with parentheses: $$(-1, 4)$$. The parentheses tell us that -1 and 4 are not included.

Now, what if one endpoint is included and the other isn't? That's called a half-open or half-closed interval. For example, if $$-4 < x \leq -1$$, we don't include -4 but we do include -1. This can be shown as $$(-4, -1]$$ with a parenthesis on the left and a bracket on the right.

Lastly, let's talk about excluding just one number. Suppose we want all numbers except 1. We show it with an open circle at 1. One way to write it is $$x \neq 1$$. Another way is using interval notation: $$(-\infty, 1) \cup (1, \infty)$$. This combines two intervals: from negative infinity to 1, and from 1 to positive infinity, using parentheses because we never actually reach infinity.

By understanding these different ways of showing intervals, you can clearly communicate which numbers you're talking about. Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it!
