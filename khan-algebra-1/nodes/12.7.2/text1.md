Sure, let me help you understand this! Let's go through the given problem step-by-step.

We have a table that shows how the temperature of a glass of warm water changes over time after being placed in a freezer. The goal is to find out which model, $$C(t)$$, best fits the temperature data, where $$t$$ is the time in minutes.

First, we need to understand the two types of models: linear and exponential. 

1. **Linear Model**: 
   - The temperature changes by a fixed amount every certain period of time.
   - For example, if you have a fixed time change, the temperature should decrease by the same number each time.

2. **Exponential Model**:
   - The temperature changes by the same factor over each fixed time period.
   - This means the percentage change of the temperature is consistent over time.

Let's look at the provided data and try to decide which model fits best:

- **Time Change**: 2 minutes

- **Temperature Change from 0 to 2 minutes**:
  - Initial Temperature: 80
  - Temperature after 2 minutes: 64.3
  - Absolute Change: $$80 - 64.3 = -15.7$$
  - Factor Change: $$\frac{64.3}{80} \approx 0.8$$

- **Temperature Change from 2 to 4 minutes**:
  - Temperature after 4 minutes: 52.7
  - Absolute Change: $$64.3 - 52.7 = -11.6$$
  - Factor Change: $$\frac{52.7}{64.3} \approx 0.82$$

From this, the absolute changes are $$-15.7$$ and $$-11.6$$, which are not consistent. Thus, a **linear model** doesn't fit well.

But the factor changes are roughly $$0.8$$ and $$0.82$$, indicating an **exponential model** might be the right choice.

Now, to model this:
- If our initial temperature is 80, and every 2 minutes the temperature is multiplied by roughly $$0.8$$, we can use the following formula: $$C(t) = 80 \times 0.8^{\frac{t}{2}}$$.

Let's simplify it:
- $$C(t) = 80 \times (0.8^{0.5})^t$$
- $$0.8^{0.5}$$ is the square root of 0.8, which is approximately $$0.89$$. 
- So, our model looks like $$C(t) \approx 80 \times 0.89^t$$.

Among the given choices, we look for something close to this model. One of the options might be similar to $$C(t) \approx 80 \times 0.89^t$$.

In short:
- Given data suggest using an exponential model because temperatures change by a consistent factor.
- The model is close to $$C(t) \approx 80 \times 0.89^t$$.
- This model best fits our data.

Remember, real-world data is never perfect, but this gets us very close!
