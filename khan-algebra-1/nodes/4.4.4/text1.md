Hey there! Let's chat about finding the y-intercept of a linear function from a table of values. Firstly, the y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis. So if we imagine a graph with the $$y$$-axis and the $$x$$-axis, the y-intercept occurs when $$x = 0$$. This means we're looking for the y-coordinate when $$x$$ is zero.

Now, given the table of values:

- When $$x = -2$$, $$y = 8$$
- When $$x = 1$$, $$y = 2$$
- When $$x = 2$$, $$y = 0$$ (which is also the x-intercept)
- When $$x = 4$$, $$y = -4$$

We want to find what happens when $$x = 0$$. 

Let's look at the changes in $$y$$ as $$x$$ changes. Notice that when $$x$$ increases by 1, $$y$$ decreases by 2. So, this change is constant.

- From $$x = -2$$ to $$x = -1$$, $$y$$ changes from 8 to 6 (decreases by 2).
- From $$x = -1$$ to $$x = 0$$, $$y$$ changes from 6 to 4 (again decreases by 2).

Therefore, when $$x = 0$$, $$y = 4$$.

So, the y-intercept of this graph is 4. This means our y-intercept point is $$(0, 4)$$. If we were to graph this, it would look something like this:

- At $$(0, 4)$$ on the y-axis.
- As $$x$$ increases, $$y$$ decreases at a constant rate.

I hope that makes it clearer! Feel free to ask more questions if you have them!
