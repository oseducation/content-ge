Hey there! In this chat, I'm excited to introduce you to a concept called a "geometric sequence." I've got plenty of more advanced videos on this topic, but let's start simple, so you can understand what a geometric sequence is.

First, let's talk about sequences in general. A sequence is just a list of numbers in a specific order. For example, if I list the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, that's a sequence. It's not a geometric sequence, but it's still a sequence.

A geometric sequence is a special type of sequence where each number after the first is found by multiplying the previous number by a fixed amount. Let me show you what I mean. 

Say the first number in my sequence is 2. If I multiply 2 by 3, I get 6. Then, if I multiply 6 by 3, I get 18. And if I keep doing this, multiplying each result by 3, I get 54, and so on. So, our sequence will be 2, 6, 18, 54... 

In this example, we started with 2, which we'll call $$a_1$$ (the first term), and we kept multiplying by 3, known as the common ratio. 

So, $$a_1 = 2$$, and our common ratio $$r = 3$$.

Now, if someone says you have a geometric sequence with $$a_1 = 90$$ and $$r = -\frac{1}{3}$$, it means the first term is 90. The second term would be 90 times -1/3, which is -30. The term after that would be -30 times -1/3, which is 10, and so on. 

Here’s what this sequence looks like: 90, -30, 10, -$$\frac{10}{3}$$, $$\frac{10}{9}$$...

It's important to know the difference between a sequence and a series. A sequence is just a list of numbers. A series is the sum of those numbers. So, in our example, the series would be
$$ 90 + (-30) + 10 + (-\frac{10}{3}) + \frac{10}{9} \cdots $$

Let's solve a word problem to make things clearer. Suppose Anne goes bungee jumping from a bridge. On her first jump, the cord stretches 120 feet. We’ll call this jump $$a_1$$. - So, $$a_1 = 120$$.

On the next bounce, the stretch is 60% of the first jump, and each later bounce is 60% of the bounce before. So, each bounce is 0.6 times the bounce before.

- The first bounce is 120 feet.
- The second bounce is $$0.6 \times 120 = 72$$ feet.
- The third bounce is $$0.6 \times 72 = 43.2$$ feet.

Every bounce is 0.6 times the previous one.

Now, let's write a general formula for the nth bounce. If $$a_1$$ is the first term and r is the common ratio (here, 0.6), the formula for the nth term is:
$$ a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1} $$.

For Anne's jumps, the nth bounce stretch is:
$$ a_n = 120 \times 0.6^{n-1} $$.

What about the 12th bounce? Using the formula:
$$ a_{12} = 120 \times 0.6^{12-1} = 120 \times 0.6^{11} $$.

Using a calculator, this is about 0.26 feet. So, after the 12th bounce, the stretch is very small, just about 3 inches.

I hope this helps you understand geometric sequences better! Feel free to ask if you have more questions.
