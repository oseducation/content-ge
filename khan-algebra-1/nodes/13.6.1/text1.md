Hey there! So today, I want to show you some new ways to factor polynomials, especially focusing on quadratics where the number in front of the $$x^2$$ term isn't 1. Let's take a look at how to factor an expression like $$4x^2 + 25x - 21$$.

In the examples we've done before, the leading number (the one in front of $$x^2$$) was either 1 or -1. But now, it’s 4. So, I’ll be teaching you a method called "factoring by grouping." This might seem a bit more tricky at first, but it's pretty neat and useful. Eventually, you might prefer using the quadratic formula because it's simpler, but let’s give this method a shot first.

Here’s how it works:
1. We need to find two numbers, let’s call them $$a$$ and $$b$$, so that $$a \cdot b = 4 \cdot (-21) = -84$$ and $$a + b = 25$$.
2. Let’s find factors of -84 that add up to 25. We try combinations like 4 and -21 (giving us -17), and -4 and 21 (giving us 17), but these don’t work. Keep trying until we see that -3 and 28 work because $$-3 + 28 = 25$$.

Next, we split the middle term using these numbers:
- So, we rewrite $$25x$$ as $$28x - 3x$$.
- Our expression now looks like this: $$4x^2 + 28x - 3x - 21$$.

Let's group these terms to make it easier:
- Group them: $$(4x^2 + 28x) + (-3x - 21)$$.
- Now, factor out common factors in each group: $$4x(x + 7) - 3(x + 7)$$.
- You’ll notice that both groups have $$(x + 7)$$, so factor that out: $$(x + 7)(4x - 3)$$.

And there you go! We’ve factored the quadratic. Let’s do another example to make sure you get it.

Example 2: Factor $$6x^2 + 7x + 1$$.
1. We need numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ so that $$a \cdot b = 6 \cdot 1 = 6$$ and $$a + b = 7$$.
2. Clearly, 1 and 6 work because $$1 + 6 = 7$$.

Rewrite the middle term:
- $$6x^2 + 6x + 1x + 1$$.

Group and factorize:
- Group them: $$(6x^2 + 6x) + (1x + 1)$$.
- Factor: $$6x(x + 1) + 1(x + 1)$$.
- Factor out $$(x + 1)$$: $$(x + 1)(6x + 1)$$.

Now, let's understand why this method works:
If we have $$(fx + g)(hx + j)$$, expanding it gives us $$fhx^2 + (fj + gh)x + gj$$. By comparing this with a quadratic $$ax^2 + bx + c$$, we see that our numbers must satisfy:
- $$a \cdot b = fh \cdot gj$$ (first term times the last term), and
- $$a + b = (fj + gh)$$(middle term coeff).

So, that's why the trick of finding $$a$$ and $$b$$ that fit those conditions helps us factor correctly!

Finally, let’s complete our understanding with a bit more practice. Sometimes, you may have terms that can be factored out first, like in:
$$-x^3 + 17x^2 - 70x$$. Notice that:
- Each term has an $$x$$. Factor out $$-x$$: $$-x(x^2 - 17x + 70)$$.
- Now factor the quadratic: $$-x(x - 10)(x - 7)$$.

I hope this helps you understand how to tackle these kinds of problems. Keep practicing, and soon it’ll become second nature!
