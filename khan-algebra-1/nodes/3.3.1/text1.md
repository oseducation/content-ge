Sure, let’s break it down together in a friendly and easy way!

The factory makes toys that sell for $10 each. The factory has 40 workers, and each worker makes 25 toys every day. The factory works 5 days a week. Our job is to find out the total value of toys the factory makes in just one day.

First, let's find out how much each toy is worth. They tell us each toy sells for $10, so we can write: $$10 \text{ dollars per toy}$$.

Next, we need to figure out how many toys are made in one day. We have:
- 40 workers
- Each worker makes 25 toys a day

So, we multiply the number of workers by the number of toys each worker makes: $$40 \text{ workers} \times 25 \text{ toys per worker}$$.

This will give us the total number of toys made in one day.

Now, the total value of the toys made in one day is the number of toys multiplied by the value of each toy. We already know each toy is worth $10.

So, the total value for one day is: $$10 \text{ dollars per toy} \times \left(40 \text{ workers} \times 25 \text{ toys per worker}\right)$$.

Let’s do the math:

1. $$40 \times 25 = 1000 \text{ toys per day}$$
2. $$10 \times 1000 = 10,000 \text{ dollars per day}$$

The factory makes toys worth $10,000 in just one day!

Now, you might wonder about the information that the factory is open 5 days a week. We don’t need that info for the question asked, which is about the total value of toys made in one day. 

If they asked us for the value of toys made in a week, then we would take our daily value, which is $10,000, and multiply by 5:

$$10,000 \text{ dollars per day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50,000 \text{ dollars per week}$$.

But since they only asked about one day, the weekly information is just extra and isn't necessary for our calculation right now.
