Sure! Let's break it down in a simple chat.

Hey there! So, we have 170 deer on a reservation, and their population is growing by 30% every year. We want to create a function that tells us how many deer there will be after $$t$$ years. Let’s work through this together.

First, let's think about the initial population. At time zero ($$t = 0$$), the number of deer, which we call $$P(0)$$, is just the starting number: 170 deer.

Now, what happens after one year ($$t = 1$$)? The population grows by 30%. So, we start with 170 deer and add 30% of that number. In math terms, that’s:
$$
170 + 0.3 \times 170
$$
We can factor out the 170:
$$
170 \times (1 + 0.3) = 170 \times 1.3
$$
This means after one year, we multiply our initial 170 by 1.3.

Continuing further, what about after two years? At the end of the first year, we have $$170 \times 1.3$$ deer. In the second year, this number grows by another 30%, so we multiply by 1.3 again:
$$
170 \times 1.3 \times 1.3 = 170 \times 1.3^2
$$
You can see the pattern here. Every year, we multiply the last year's population by 1.3.

So, if we want to know the population after $$t$$ years, we would use the following formula:
$$
P(t) = 170 \times 1.3^t
$$
This formula tells us that after $$t$$ years, we take our initial 170 deer and multiply by 1.3 raised to the power of $$t$$, to account for the 30% growth each year.

For example, to find the deer population after 100 years, plug in $$t = 100$$:
$$
P(100) = 170 \times 1.3^{100}
$$

I hope that makes sense! Feel free to ask any questions or let me know if you need more help.
