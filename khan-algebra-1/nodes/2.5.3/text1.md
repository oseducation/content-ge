Sure, let's break it down step by step. Ready? Here we go!

Let's do a few problems that use the ideas we learned before. 

First, we have the inequality $$4x + 3 < -1$$. We want to find all the $$x$$ values that make this true. 

1. First, we need to get rid of the 3, so we subtract 3 from both sides:
   $$4x + 3 - 3 < -1 - 3$$
   Now it's simpler: $$4x < -4$$

2. Next, we divide both sides by 4:
   $$\frac{4x}{4} < \frac{-4}{4}$$
   So, $$x < -1$$.

In interval notation, this means all the $$x$$s from negative infinity up to (but not including) -1, like this: $$( -\infty, -1)$$.

Now, let's try a bit harder one: $$5x > 8x + 27$$.

1. We need all the $$x$$s on one side, so let's subtract $$8x$$ from both sides:
   $$5x - 8x > 8x - 8x + 27$$
   This simplifies to:
   $$-3x > 27$$

2. Now, divide both sides by -3. Remember, dividing by a negative number flips the inequality:
   $$\frac{-3x}{-3} < \frac{27}{-3}$$
   So, $$x < -9$$.

In interval notation, this means all $$x$$s from negative infinity up to (but not including) -9: $$( -\infty, -9)$$.

Okay, let's tackle a more complex one: $$8x - 5(4x + 1) \geq -1 + 2(4x - 3)$$.

1. Simplify each side. Distribute the numbers:
   $$8x - 5 \cdot 4x - 5 \cdot 1 \geq -1 + 2 \cdot 4x + 2 \cdot -3$$
   This becomes:
   $$8x - 20x - 5 \geq -1 + 8x - 6$$

2. Combine like terms:
   $$8x - 20x - 5 \geq 8x - 7$$
   $$-12x - 5 \geq 8x - 7$$

3. Move all $$x$$s to one side by subtracting $$8x$$ from both sides:
   $$-12x - 8x - 5 \geq -7$$
   $$-20x - 5 \geq -7$$

4. Add 5 to both sides:
   $$-20x \geq -2$$

5. Finally, divide by -20, remembering to flip the inequality:
   $$\frac{-20x}{-20} \leq \frac{-2}{-20}$$
   So, $$x \leq \frac{1}{10}$$.

In interval notation, this means all $$x$$s from negative infinity up to (and including) 1/10: $$( -\infty, \frac{1}{10}]$$.

If we draw a number line, it would look like this:
- Start from negative infinity.
- Go up to and include 1/10.

See? Step by step, it's not so bad! Keep practicing, and it will get easier. You're doing great!
