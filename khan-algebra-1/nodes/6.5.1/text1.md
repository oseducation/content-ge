Sure! Let's break it down together in a simple way.

The king's advisor, Arbegla, is watching you, the king, and the bird discuss things. He starts to feel a bit jealous because he's supposed to be the wisest man in the kingdom. So, he steps in and says, "If you and this bird are so smart, how about you solve the Riddle of the Fruit Prices?" The king agrees and asks Arbegla to tell you the riddle.

Arbegla explains, "We want to keep track of how much our fruit costs, but we forgot to log the prices. We only know how much we spent in total and how much fruit we got. A week ago, we bought 2 pounds of apples and 1 pound of bananas for $3. Another time, we bought 6 pounds of apples and 3 pounds of bananas for $15. Can you figure out the cost of apples and bananas?"

So, you and the bird start to solve it. First, you need to define some variables to make it easier. Let's call:

- $$a$$ = the cost of apples per pound
- $$b$$ = the cost of bananas per pound

From the first trip, we know:
- 2 pounds of apples and 1 pound of bananas cost $$3$$
So, we can write this as an equation: $$2a + b = 3$$

From the second trip:
- 6 pounds of apples and 3 pounds of bananas cost $$15$$
So, we can write this as another equation: $$6a + 3b = 15$$

Now we have two equations to solve for $$a$$ and $$b$$.

We could use the elimination method. To do that, we might want to eliminate one variable, let's say $$a$$. Notice that if we multiply the first equation by $$-3$$, we can cancel out $$a$$ from both equations. So, let's do that:

$$-3 \cdot (2a + b = 3)$$
$$-6a - 3b = -9$$

Now, we add this to the second equation:

$$6a + 3b = 15$$
$$-6a - 3b = -9$$

When we add them, we get:

$$0 = 6$$ 

This is not possible! Something strange is going on. 

The bird whispers into the kingâ€™s ear, and the king says, "The bird thinks there's no solution. Maybe we should graph it to understand why."

So, you decide to graph the equations. First, let's solve each for $$b$$ in terms of $$a$$:

1. For the first equation: $$2a + b = 3$$
    $$b = -2a + 3$$

2. For the second equation: $$6a + 3b = 15$$
    Divide by 3:
    $$2a + b = 5$$
    $$b = -2a + 5$$

When we graph these, we notice both have the same slope ($$-2$$) but different intercepts ($$3$$ and $$5$$). This means the lines are parallel and do not intersect, indicating no solution.

The bird was right! These lines represent inconsistent information. The system of equations has no solution. So, Arbegla either made a mistake or the prices changed between your visits. 

The bird whispers once more to the king, who then acknowledges that you did a great job with the algebra!
