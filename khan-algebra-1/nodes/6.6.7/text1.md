Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Imagine we're chatting about this together:

An electronics warehouse sends out shipments of televisions and DVD players in certain combinations to stores across the country. Let's say they tell us that the weight of 3 TVs and 5 DVD players is 62.5 pounds. Also, they say the weight of 3 TVs and 2 DVD players is 52 pounds. We need to create a system of equations to represent this situation and then solve it to find out how much each TV and DVD player weighs.

First, let's set up our equations. Let’s let \( t \) represent the weight of one TV, and \( d \) represent the weight of one DVD player. From what they told us, we can write:

1. The weight of 3 TVs and 5 DVD players equals 62.5 pounds:
   $$3t + 5d = 62.5$$

2. The weight of 3 TVs and 2 DVD players equals 52 pounds:
   $$3t + 2d = 52$$

Now we have our system of equations. The next step is to solve it. 

A good method here is to eliminate one of the variables. Notice that both equations have \( 3t \) in them. We can use that to our advantage. If we subtract the second equation from the first, we can get rid of the \( t \) terms:

We start by subtracting the second equation from the first:

$$ (3t + 5d) - (3t + 2d) = 62.5 - 52 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ 3d = 10.5 $$

Now, we can solve for \( d \) by dividing both sides by 3:

$$ d = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5 $$

So, one DVD player weighs 3.5 pounds.

Next, we'll substitute \( d = 3.5 \) back into one of the original equations to find the weight of one TV:

Let’s use the first equation:

$$ 3t + 5 \cdot 3.5 = 62.5 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ 3t + 17.5 = 62.5 $$

Subtract 17.5 from both sides:

$$ 3t = 45 $$

Finally, divide both sides by 3:

$$ t = 15 $$

So, one TV weighs 15 pounds.

We've now solved the problem! A DVD player weighs 3.5 pounds, and a TV weighs 15 pounds.
