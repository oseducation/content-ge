Sure! Let's walk through this together.

We have a graph of the function $$f(x)$$ shown below. We need to find an input value, other than $$x = -5$$, where $$f(x)$$ is the same as $$f(-5)$$.

On the graph, the x-axis is the horizontal line, and the y-axis is the vertical line. The blue line represents $$y = f(x)$$. For example, when $$x = 1$$, $$f(x) = 1$$ because that’s where the blue line crosses the y-axis. When $$x = 7$$, $$f(7) = 5$$. And when $$x = 9$$, $$f(9) = 6$$.

Now, we need to find another x-value where $$f(x) = f(-5)$$. Let's see what $$f(-5)$$ is first. We look at the graph where $$x = -5$$ and move up to where the blue line is. Here, $$f(-5) = 4$$ because the blue line is at y = 4.

Next, we look for other places on the graph where y is also 4. Moving horizontally along y = 4, we see it happens again when $$x = 4$$. So, $$f(4) = 4$$, which is the same as $$f(-5)$$.

Therefore, the input value other than $$-5$$ is $$x = 4$$.

And that’s it! We found that $$x = 4$$ gives us the same value as $$f(-5)$$. Good job!
