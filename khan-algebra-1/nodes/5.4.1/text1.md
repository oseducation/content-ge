Sure! Let's break this down together:

What I've drawn here in yellow is a line. And let's say we know two things about this line. We know that it has a slope of $$m$$, and we know that the point $$(a, b)$$ is on this line. Now, the question is: Can we come up with an equation for this line using this information? Let's try it!

Any point $$(x, y)$$ on this line would have to satisfy the condition that the slope between the point $$(a, b)$$ and $$(x, y)$$ is equal to $$m$$. So let's use this information to construct an equation.

First, let's remember that slope is just the change in $$y$$ over the change in $$x$$. We can write this as:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
\]
The Greek letter Delta (Î”) means "change in."

For our specific points $$(a, b)$$ and $$(x, y)$$, the change in $$y$$ is:
\[
y - b
\]
And the change in $$x$$ is:
\[
x - a
\]
So we can plug these into our slope formula:
\[
\frac{y - b}{x - a} = m
\]
This equation describes any $$x$$ and $$y$$ that satisfy it as being on the line, because the slope between $$(a, b)$$ and $$(x, y)$$ is $$m$$.

To make this equation a bit more familiar, let's get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides by $$(x - a)$$:
\[
(x - a) \cdot \frac{y - b}{x - a} = m \cdot (x - a)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
y - b = m(x - a)
\]
This is called the point-slope form of the equation of a line. It is named this way because it uses a point $$(a, b)$$ and the slope $$m$$ to describe the line.

Now, let's see how useful this can be. For example, if someone tells you that a line has a slope of 2 and passes through the point $(-7, 5)$, you can use the point-slope form to write its equation:
\[
y - 5 = 2(x - (-7))
\]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
y - 5 = 2(x + 7)
\]
We can also convert this into slope-intercept form, which is the $$y = mx + b$$ form many of us are more familiar with. To do this, distribute the 2:
\[
y - 5 = 2x + 14
\]
Next, add 5 to both sides to isolate $$y$$:
\[
y = 2x + 19
\]
Now, we have the slope-intercept form of the line, $$y = 2x + 19$$.

So, there you have it! We've written and converted the equation of a line using different forms, making it easy to understand and use in various situations.
