Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

You asked if the point $$(2, 5)$$ is a solution for this system of inequalities:
1. $$y \geq 2x + 1$$
2. $$x > 1$$

For $$(2, 5)$$ to be a solution, it has to satisfy both inequalities. Let's check them one by one.

First inequality: $$y \geq 2x + 1$$

If $$x = 2$$ and $$y = 5$$, we put these values into the first inequality:
$$5 \geq 2 \cdot 2 + 1$$

Now, solve the right side:
$$5 \geq 4 + 1$$
$$5 \geq 5$$

This is true because 5 is equal to 5. So, $$(2, 5)$$ satisfies the first inequality.

Second inequality: $$x > 1$$

If $$x = 2$$, we check:
$$2 > 1$$

This is also true, so $$(2, 5)$$ satisfies the second inequality too.

Since $$(2, 5)$$ makes both inequalities true, it is a solution for the system.
