- [Instructor] Hey there! So, Kaya rode her bike toward a tree at a steady speed. We have a table showing how far she is from the tree based on her front tire's rotations. When the tire spins 4 times, she's 22.5 meters from the tree; at 8 spins, she's 12.5 meters away; and at 12 spins, she's just 2.5 meters from the tree. This means she's getting closer with each tire spin.

Now, let's answer some questions:

1. How far was the tree in the beginning?
2. How far does Kaya travel with each tire spin?
3. How many spins did it take to reach the tree?

First, let's figure out how far the tree was at the start. After 4 spins, Kaya was 22.5 meters away. If we add 4 more spins (a total of 8), she's 10 meters closer, or down to 12.5 meters from the tree. To find the starting distance (at 0 spins), we need to go back by those 4 spins. Since she gets 10 meters closer after 4 spins, she would be 10 meters further back at 0 spins. So, we add 10 meters to 22.5 meters, giving us 32.5 meters. So, Kaya was 32.5 meters away when she started.

Next, let's see how far she travels with each tire spin. We know she covers 10 meters with 4 spins. So, if we divide both by 4, we get that she travels $$\frac{10 \text{ meters}}{4 \text{ spins}} = 2.5 \text{ meters per spin}$$.

Finally, how many spins did it take to reach the tree? At 12 spins, she's 2.5 meters away. She moves 2.5 meters per spin, so she needs just 1 more spin to cover the last 2.5 meters. Adding this spin, we find she needed a total of 13 spins.

Now, let's visualize this on a graph. If we plot the tire spins on the x-axis and the distance to the tree on the y-axis, we'd have points like (0, 32.5), (4, 22.5), (8, 12.5), and (12, 2.5). This shows a straight line since she's moving at a steady rate. 

The y-intercept, where the line crosses the y-axis, is the distance to the tree at 0 spins, which is 32.5 meters. The slope of the line, which is how steep it is, is the change in distance over the change in spins. We already worked out that she travels $$-2.5 \text{ meters per spin}$$ (negative because she's getting closer).

The x-intercept, where the line meets the x-axis, tells us the number of spins needed to reach the tree, which is 13 spins.

So, to recap:
1. The tree was 32.5 meters away at the start.
2. Kaya travels 2.5 meters with each tire spin.
3. It took 13 spins to reach the tree.

Great job following along with these steps!
