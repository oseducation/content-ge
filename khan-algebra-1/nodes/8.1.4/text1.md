Hey there! Let's talk about what we have here, which is a picture showing a function. This function is written as $$Y = H(X)$$. Now, when people see this function notation, they might feel a bit scared. But don't worry! It’s actually pretty simple once you understand what it's saying.

A function is really just something that takes an input (in this case, X) and does something to it to give an output (which we call Y).

Let's try an example. Look at the graph and find what $$H(4)$$ is. Take a moment to think about it. 

Okay, so $$H(4)$$ just means that when we put 4 into our function $$H$$, what value of $$Y$$ do we get? Another way to say it is, when $$X = 4$$, what is $$Y$$? If you look at the graph, when $$X = 4$$, $$Y = 3$$. So, $$H(4) = 3$$.

Let’s do another one. What about $$H(0)$$? Pause and think about it. 

For $$H(0)$$, we see that when $$X = 0$$, $$Y$$ is 4. So, $$H(0) = 4$$. That’s all there is to it. Given an input, you find the output. Each point on the graph shows a different output for a given input.

Now, remember, one important thing about functions is that for any input $$X$$, you only get one output $$Y$$. For example, if we had two points for $$X = 6$$ with different $$Y$$ values, we wouldn’t know what $$H(6)$$ is. It could be 1, or it could be 3. That would mean it’s not a function anymore.

It’s also possible for different $$X$$ values to have the same $$Y$$ value. For instance, if we check what $$H(-4)$$ is, we see that when $$X = -4$$, $$Y = 2$$. So, $$H(-4) = 2$$. Similarly, when $$X = 2$$, $$Y$$ is also 2. So, $$H(2) = 2$$. This is okay!

But if one $$X$$ has two different $$Y$$ values, it stops being a function. However, the example we are looking at is a function, as long as we don't change it.

I hope this makes it clearer for you! Functions can be fun once you get the hang of them.
