Sure! It sounds like you're starting to learn how to draw graphs for equations. Let's take a look at the linear equation \(5x + 2y = 20\). A line on a graph is just the set of all \( (x, y) \) points that make this equation true. To make it easier, we'll create a table with some \(x\) values and find the \(y\) values that go with them.

First, let's solve for \(y\) in the equation \(5x + 2y = 20\). This will make finding \(y\) for different \(x\) values simpler. 

1. Start with: 
   \[
   5x + 2y = 20
   \]

2. Subtract \(5x\) from both sides: 
   \[
   2y = 20 - 5x
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2: 
   \[
   y = 10 - \frac{5}{2} x
   \]

Now, let's come up with some \(x\) values and calculate the corresponding \(y\) values:

1. **When \(x = 0\)**:
   \[
   y = 10 - \frac{5}{2} \cdot 0 = 10
   \]
   So, our point is \((0, 10)\). This means that when \(x\) is at 0 on the \(x\)-axis, \(y\) is at 10 on the \(y\)-axis.

2. **When \(x = 2\)**:
   \[
   y = 10 - \frac{5}{2} \cdot 2 = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]
   So, our point is \((2, 5)\). This means that when \(x\) is at 2 on the \(x\)-axis, \(y\) is at 5 on the \(y\)-axis.

3. **When \(x = 4\)**:
   \[
   y = 10 - \frac{5}{2} \cdot 4 = 10 - 10 = 0
   \]
   So, our point is \((4, 0)\). This means that when \(x\) is at 4 on the \(x\)-axis, \(y\) is at 0 on the \(y\)-axis.

With these points \((0, 10)\), \((2, 5)\), and \((4, 0)\), we can draw the line on a graph. 

To do this:
1. Plot these points on a graph.
2. Connect them with a straight line using a ruler.

And that's it! You have the graph for the linear equation \(5x + 2y = 20\). If you want to check more points, you can, but usually, just two points are enough to draw a straight line.
