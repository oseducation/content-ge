Alright, let’s work through this together!

We have a linear equation, and we're given two points on the line. When $$X = 4$$, $$Y = 9$$, which we plot on the $$(X, Y)$$ plane. We also know that when $$X = 6$$, $$Y = 1$$, and plot this point too. The green line represents all the solutions to this equation.

Now, our job is to find the equation of this line and express it in both point-slope form and slope-intercept form.

First, let’s talk about point-slope form. This form is very useful if you know a point on the line and the slope. We have two points that are solutions to the equation, so we can find the slope.

Slope is calculated as the change in $$Y$$ over the change in $$X$$, often described as "rise over run." If we take our two points $$(4, 9)$$ and $$(6, 1)$$:

- The change in $$Y$$ from $$(4, 9)$$ to $$(6, 1)$$ is $$1 - 9 = -8$$.
- The change in $$X$$ from $$(4, 9)$$ to $$(6, 1)$$ is $$6 - 4 = 2$$.

So, the slope $$m$$ is given by:
$$
m = \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4
$$

Now we have the slope, and we have two points. Let's use the point $$(4, 9)$$ to write the equation in point-slope form:
$$
Y - Y_1 = m(X - X_1)
$$

Substituting in our values ($$Y_1 = 9$$, $$X_1 = 4$$, and $$m = -4$$), we get:
$$
Y - 9 = -4(X - 4)
$$

This is our point-slope form!

Next, let’s convert this to slope-intercept form, which looks like:
$$
Y = mX + B
$$

We start with our point-slope form:
$$
Y - 9 = -4(X - 4)
$$

Distribute the $$-4$$:
$$
Y - 9 = -4X + 16
$$

To isolate $$Y$$, add 9 to both sides:
$$
Y = -4X + 25
$$

Now we have the linear equation in slope-intercept form. The slope $$m$$ is $$-4$$, and the y-intercept $$B$$ is 25. This means when $$X = 0$$, $$Y = 25$$.

So, we wrote the equation in both point-slope form:
$$
Y - 9 = -4(X - 4)
$$

And slope-intercept form:
$$
Y = -4X + 25
$$

I hope that made sense and was helpful!
