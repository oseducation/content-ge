Hey there! Let's look at how the number of branches of an oak tree and a birch tree have changed since 1950. They gave us some tables for the data. For the oak tree, when time is zero (at the start), it has 34 branches. After three years, it has 46 branches, and so it goes on. The birch tree data is similar. At the beginning, it has 8 branches. In 10 years, it has 33 branches, and so on.

What we're thinking about here is how to model this data using functions. We'll consider using either linear functions or exponential functions. Which one fits the data better?

Let's start with the oak tree. Notice that whenever we increase the time by a fixed amount (three years in this case), the number of branches changes. Is this change roughly constant, suggesting a linear model? Or does the change depend on how many branches we already have, suggesting an exponential model?

For the oak tree:
- From 34 to 46 branches: $$+12$$ branches
- From 46 to 59 branches: $$+13$$ branches
- From 59 to 70 branches: $$+11$$ branches
- From 70 to 82 branches: $$+12$$ branches

The change in branches is not exact, but it averages around $$+12$$ branches per three years. In real-world data, we rarely see exact numbers, but we need a model that approximates this behavior well. Here, a linear model seems suitable.

So, we start with 34 branches and add about 4 branches every year (since 12 branches over 3 years is 4 branches per year):

$$B(t) = 34 + 4t$$

For example, when $$t = 0$$ years, $$B(0) = 34$$ branches. At $$t = 12$$ years, $$B(12) = 34 + 48 = 82$$ branches. This linear model fits the oak tree data quite well.

Now, let's look at the birch tree. Again, time advances by a fixed amount (10 years), but the change in branches is very different:
- From 8 to 33 branches: $$+25$$ branches
- From 33 to 128 branches: $$+95$$ branches
- From 128 to 512 branches: $$+384$$ branches

Clearly, this is not linear. Let's consider an exponential model. How much do we multiply to get from one step to the next?

- From 8 to 33 branches is roughly $$ \times 4 $$
- From 33 to 128 branches is also roughly $$ \times 4 $$
- From 128 to 512 branches is exactly $$ \times 4 $$

We multiply by 4 every 10 years. To write this as a function:

$$ B(t) = 8 \cdot 4^{t/10} $$

Let's test this model. For $$ t = 30 $$ years:
$$ B(30) = 8 \cdot 4^{30/10} = 8 \cdot 4^3 = 8 \cdot 64 = 512 $$ branches.

So, this exponential model fits the birch tree data very well.

In summary:
- The oak tree fits a linear model: $$ B(t) = 34 + 4t $$
- The birch tree fits an exponential model: $$ B(t) = 8 \cdot 4^{t/10} $$
