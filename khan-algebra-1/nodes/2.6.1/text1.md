Sure, let's work through this together!

We need to solve for $$z$$. We have the compound inequality: 

1. $$5z + 7 < 27$$
2. $$-3z \leq 18$$

This means $$z$$ has to satisfy either one of these conditions.

Let's start by solving the first inequality:

1. $$5z + 7 < 27$$

First, we'll isolate $$z$$ on the left side. To do that, subtract 7 from both sides:

$$5z + 7 - 7 < 27 - 7$$

This simplifies to:

$$5z < 20$$

Now, divide both sides by 5:

$$\frac{5z}{5} < \frac{20}{5}$$

Which gives us:

$$z < 4$$

Now, let's solve the second inequality:

2. $$-3z \leq 18$$

To isolate $$z$$, we need to divide both sides by -3. Remember, when we divide or multiply by a negative number, we must flip the inequality sign:

$$\frac{-3z}{-3} \geq \frac{18}{-3}$$

Which simplifies to:

$$z \geq -6$$

So our two conditions are: 
- $$z < 4$$ 
- $$z \geq -6$$

This means $$z$$ can be less than 4 or greater than or equal to -6. Let's put this together:

$$z < 4 \text { or } z \geq -6$$

This actually covers all numbers, because any number will satisfy at least one of these conditions. Let's plot this on a number line to see:

- We'll mark 0, and then mark 4 and -6.
- For $$z < 4$$, put an open circle around 4 and shade everything to the left.
- For $$z \geq -6$$, put a filled circle around -6 and shade everything to the right, including 4.

We'll see that the entire number line is shaded. So any number you pick will work!

You can test it with examples:
- For $$z = 0$$: $$5(0) + 7 = 7$$ which is less than 27, and $$-3(0) = 0$$ which is less than 18.
- For $$z = 4$$: It only meets the second condition. $$-3(4) = -12$$ which is less than 18, but $$5(4) + 7 = 27$$ which is not less than 27.

So, any number on the number line works, meaning the solution set is all real numbers.
