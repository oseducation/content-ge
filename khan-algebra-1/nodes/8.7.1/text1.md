Sure, let's look at this together. We want to see if the points on this graph show a function. Remember, a function is just a way to pair up items from one set (the domain) with items from another set (the range). 

So, if we have something from the domain, let's call it $$x$$, and we put it into our function, it should tell us exactly one item from the range. This means if we give the function $$x$$, it should give us one clear answer from the range. If it gives us more than one answer or isn't clear, then it's not a function.

Now, let's think about this using an example graph. The numbers we can put into the function are the $$x$$ values where the function is defined. 

For example, if $$x = -1$$, and assuming the x-axis goes left-right and the y-axis goes up-down, the function tells us that $$y = 3$$. So when you put $$-1$$ into the function, it gives you 3. This is clear and makes sense.

Next, if $$x = 2$$, the function shows $$y = -2$$. So $$f(2) = -2$$. This shows that 2 from the x-axis (domain) points to $$-2$$ on the y-axis (range).

Now, if $$x = 3$$, the $$y$$ value is 2. Again, $$f(3) = 2$$, which looks clear.

But here’s where it gets tricky. When $$x = 4$$, the function seems to give two different $$y$$ values: 5 and $$-1$$. Normally, each x should match with only one y, but here we see 4 pointing to both 5 and $$-1$$. This means it is not a function because it’s not clear if $$f(4) = 5$$ or $$f(4) = -1$$.

We can also use what is called the vertical line test here. If you draw a straight line up and down (vertical) at $$x = 4$$, and it crosses the graph in more than one spot, that means $$x = 4$$ gives multiple $$y$$ values. This tells us it's not a function, just a relation. A function is a special kind of relation that behaves nicely and gives one clear result for each input.

So, because of this situation with $$x = 4$$, the graph shows a relation but not a function.
