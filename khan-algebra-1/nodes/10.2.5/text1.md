Sure, let's break it down in simpler terms! Here we go:

We have this special type of function called a piecewise linear function. It changes its "rule" depending on the value of $$x$$. So, let's talk about its domain first and then its range.

The domain is just all the $$x$$ values where this function is defined. Our function $$g(x)$$ isn't defined for $$x \leq -6$$. It only works for $$x$$ values greater than $$-6$$ and up to $$6$$. So, we can say:

$$-6 < x \leq 6$$ 

This covers all the $$x$$ values for our function.

Now, let's talk about the range. The range is all the possible output values of $$g(x)$$. To figure this out, we need to look at the different parts of our function:

1. For $$-6 < x \leq -3$$, $$g(x) = x + 7$$
   - When $$x$$ is close to $$-6$$ (but not equal), $$g(x) \approx 1$$
   - When $$x$$ is $$-3$$, $$g(x) = 4$$

2. For $$-3 < x < 4$$, $$g(x) = 1 - x$$
   - When $$x$$ is close to $$-3$$, $$g(x) \approx 4$$
   - When $$x$$ is close to $$4$$ (but not equal), $$g(x) \approx -3$$

3. For $$4 \leq x \leq 6$$, $$g(x) = 2x - 11$$
   - When $$x$$ is $$4$$, $$g(x) = -3$$
   - When $$x$$ is $$6$$, $$g(x) = 1$$

So, $$g(x)$$ can take any value from $$-3$$ to $$4$$. This means our range is:

$$-3 \leq g(x) \leq 4$$

Hope this helps you understand piecewise linear functions better!
