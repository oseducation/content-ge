Sure! Let's break this down step-by-step together in a simpler way, so it's easier to understand.

First, we're going to find the slope of the line that goes through two points: $$(7, -1)$$ and $$(-3, -1)$$. To help us visualize, let's draw a quick graph:

1. **Plot the points**:
   - The first point is $$(7, -1)$$. On the x-axis (horizontal line), go to 7, and on the y-axis (vertical line), go down to -1.
   - The second point is $$(-3, -1)$$. On the x-axis, go back to -3, then on the y-axis, you stay at -1.

2. **Draw the line**:
   - Connect these two points with a straight line. It should look completely flat, going from left to right.

3. **Understanding slope**:
   - Slope is how steep a line is. It's calculated by "rise over run", which means how much the y-value (up/down) changes compared to how much the x-value (left/right) changes.

4. **Calculate the slope**:
   - To find the slope $$m$$, use the formula:
     $$ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$
   - Here, $$\Delta y$$ (change in y) is $$y_2 - y_1$$, which means the second y-point minus the first y-point.
   - And $$\Delta x$$ (change in x) is $$x_2 - x_1$$, which means the second x-point minus the first x-point.

5. **Apply the formula**:
   - In our case, the y-values are the same: $$y_1 = -1$$ and $$y_2 = -1$$. So, the change in y is:
     $$ \Delta y = -1 - (-1) = 0 $$
   - For the x-values, we have: $$x_1 = 7$$ and $$x_2 = -3$$. So, the change in x is:
     $$ \Delta x = -3 - 7 = -10 $$
   - Now, we plug these values into the slope formula:
     $$ m = \frac{0}{-10} = 0 $$

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The slope of the line is 0. This means the line is perfectly horizontal and has no steepness at all.

No matter which point you start with and which one you end with, you will get the same result because the y-values don't change. The line stays flat, so the slope remains 0.
