Sure, let's try that together! We're going to figure out what $$ (x + 3)(x - 3) $$ is. I encourage you to pause and see if you can work it out first. Okay, one way to solve this is by using the distributive property twice, like we've done before with multiplying binomials.

First, take the whole $$(x + 3)$$ and multiply it by each term in $$(x - 3)$$. We'll start by multiplying it by $$x$$. So, we get $$x(x + 3)$$. Next, we multiply it by $$-3$$, giving us $$-3(x + 3)$$.

Now let's apply the distributive property one more time. Distributing $$x$$ in $$(x + 3)$$ gives us $$x \cdot x + x \cdot 3$$, which is $$x^2 + 3x$$. On the other side, distributing $$-3$$ in $$(x + 3)$$ gives us $$-3 \cdot x + (-3) \cdot 3$$, which is $$-3x - 9$$.

Putting it all together, we get:
$$ x^2 + 3x - 3x - 9 $$

Notice that $$3x$$ and $$-3x$$ cancel each other out, leaving us with:
$$ x^2 - 9 $$

See the pattern here? We added 3 and then subtracted 3, and the middle terms canceled out, leaving us with $$ x^2 - 9 $$. This pattern works for any number we add and subtract like this.

Let's try it more generally. Instead of $$x + 3$$ and $$x - 3$$, let's use $$x + a$$ and $$x - a$$. Following the same steps:

First, distribute $$(x + a)$$ over both terms in $$(x - a)$$:
$$ (x + a)x - (x + a)a $$

Next, distribute $$ x $$ and $$ -a $$ across $$(x + a)$$:
$$ x^2 + ax - ax - a^2 $$

Again, $$ax$$ and $$-ax$$ cancel out, leaving us with:
$$ x^2 - a^2 $$

So, when you have something like $$ (x + a)(x - a) $$, it always simplifies to $$ x^2 - a^2 $$.

For example, if you need to find $$ (x + 10)(x - 10) $$, you can quickly see that it fits our pattern. Here, $$ a $$ is 10, so:
$$ (x + 10)(x - 10) = x^2 - 10^2 = x^2 - 100 $$

I hope this helps you see the pattern and simplify these kinds of problems quickly!
