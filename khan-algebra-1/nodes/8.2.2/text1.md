Hi there! Let's look at this question together. We're given a function $$g$$ and its graph. The question asks us to find the input value where $$ g(x) = -2 $$.

To understand this, remember that the x-axis on the graph represents the inputs (x-values), and the graph itself shows the outputs (y-values or $$ g(x) $$).

Let's go through a few points on the graph to see how it works:
- When $$ x = 7 $$, the graph shows $$ g(7) = 1 $$.
- When $$ x = 9 $$, the graph shows $$ g(9) = 2 $$.
- When $$ x = 6 $$, the graph shows $$ g(6) = 0 $$.

Now, we need to find the x-value where the graph shows $$ g(x) = -2 $$, which means the y-coordinate is -2. 

Looking at the graph, we find the point where the y-value is -2. It looks like this happens when $$ x = -9 $$.

So, $$ g(-9) = -2 $$, which means the input value we're looking for is $$ -9 $$.

Great job!
