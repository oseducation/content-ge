Sure, let's break this down together. Imagine that Arjun put some money in a savings account a year ago. We'll use $$M(t)$$ to show how much money is in his account $$t$$ days after he opened it. Now, what does $$M(30) - M(0) = 100$$ mean?

First, let's understand what $$M(30)$$ and $$M(0)$$ are. When $$t = 30$$, we input that into our function $$M$$ to get $$M(30)$$. This is the balance of his account 30 days after he opened it, so we'll call this the balance after 30 days. Similarly, $$M(0)$$ is what we get when $$t = 0$$. This is the balance right at the start, or the initial balance.

So, $$M(30) - M(0) = 100$$ means we're taking the balance after 30 days and subtracting the initial balance, and the difference is $100. This can mean two things: either the balance 30 days later is $100 more than the initial balance, or he added $100 to the account in those 30 days.

Now, let's look at the choices given:

1. **"30 days after it was opened, the balance of Arjun's account was equal to 100."**
   This isn't right. This statement would mean $$M(30) = 100$$, but that's not what we're told.

2. **"Arjan had the initial amount of money in his account 30 days after he opened it."**
   This is also not correct. This would mean $$M(0) = M(30)$$, which again is not what we have.

3. **"Arjan made a profit of over 100 dollars over the first 30 days since the account was opened."**
   This makes sense. It means his account balance is $100 higher after 30 days compared to his initial balance. This matches with what we know about $$M(30) - M(0) = 100$$.

So, the correct interpretation is the third choice: Arjun made a profit of $100 in the first 30 days since opening his account. This could be from interest or other earnings in the account during that time.
