Hey there! Let's chat about this problem together. 

So, Glen is draining the water from his baby's bathtub, and the graph shows the relationship between the amount of water left in the tub (in liters) and the time that has passed (in minutes) since Glen started. We need to figure out a few things:

1. How much water was in the tub when Glen started draining?
2. How much water drains every minute? Every two minutes?
3. How long does it take for the tub to drain completely?

Let's break it down step-by-step.

### How much water was in the tub when Glen started draining?

When we talk about the start, that's at $$t = 0$$ minutes. On the graph, look at where $$t = 0$$. The point where this line meets the vertical axis (y-axis) tells us how much water was in the tub at the start. This point even has a special name: the $$y$$-intercept. From the graph, we can see that at $$t = 0$$, the amount of water is 15 liters.

### How much water drains every minute? Every two minutes?

This is about the rate at which water is draining. Let's find clear points on the graph. 

- At 1 minute, there's 12 liters left.
- At 2 minutes, there's 9 liters left.

So, from 1 minute to 2 minutes (which is a 1-minute change), the water goes from 12 liters to 9 liters, meaning it loses 3 liters. So, the water is draining at a rate of 3 liters per minute.

For every two minutes, it would drain twice as much: $$2 * 3 = 6$$ liters every two minutes.

### How long does it take for the tub to drain completely?

This happens when there's no water left in the tub, so the $$y$$ value (amount of water) is 0. On the graph, this is where the line meets the horizontal axis (x-axis), known as the $$x$$-intercept. 

From the graph, we see that the water is all gone at $$t = 5$$ minutes. It makes sense because if you start with 15 liters and drain 3 liters per minute, it takes 5 minutes to drain all the water ($$15 / 3 = 5$$ minutes).

And that's it! Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions!
