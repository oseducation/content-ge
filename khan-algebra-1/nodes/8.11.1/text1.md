Sure! Let's chat about this step-by-step.

So, we are looking at $$d(t)$$, where $$d$$ stands for distance and $$t$$ stands for time. This means distance changes with time. On the left side, we have $$d(t) = 3t + 1$$. If you remember from algebra, this is a straight line. The rate at which this line changes is called the slope. We can find out how distance changes with time by looking at the slope.

If we go from $$t = 1$$ to $$t = 2$$, the change in time, $$\Delta t$$, is 1 second. Now, let’s see how the distance changes. At $$t = 1$$, the distance is 4 meters, and at $$t = 2$$, it’s 7 meters. So, the change in distance, $$\Delta d$$, is 3 meters.

To find the slope, we divide the change in distance by the change in time:
$$ \text{slope} = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{3 \text{ meters}}{1 \text{ second}} = 3 \text{ meters per second} $$
This slope is also known as speed, which means we are moving at 3 meters per second.

For a straight line, this slope doesn’t change, no matter which two points you choose. 

But on the right side, the situation is different. The rate of change is not constant. This is a sneak peek into what we study in differential calculus. Here, we are interested in how quickly something is changing at a very specific moment, called the instantaneous rate of change.

Imagine we draw a line that just touches the curve at a point (called a tangent line). The slope of this tangent line shows how fast distance is changing at that specific moment. As $$t$$ increases, the slope gets steeper, meaning the rate of change is also increasing.

Although we will explore this more deeply in calculus, right now, we can think about the average rate of change. This is similar to finding the slope but for a secant line (a line that touches the curve at two points).

Let's say our secant line touches the curve at $$t = 0$$ and $$t = 1$$:
1. The change in time, $$\Delta t$$, is 1 second.
2. At $$t = 0$$, the distance, $$d(0)$$, is 1 meter.
3. At $$t = 1$$, the distance, $$d(1)$$, is 2 meters.
   
So, the change in distance, $$\Delta d$$, is 1 meter. The slope of our secant line (average rate of change) would be:
$$ \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{1 \text{ meter}}{1 \text{ second}} = 1 \text{ meter per second} $$

Now, let’s find the average rate of change from $$t = 2$$ to $$t = 3$$:
1. The change in time, $$\Delta t$$, is still 1 second.
2. At $$t = 2$$, the distance, $$d(2)$$, is 5 meters.
3. At $$t = 3$$, the distance, $$d(3)$$, is 10 meters.
   
So, the change in distance, $$\Delta d$$, is 5 meters. The slope of our secant line (average rate of change) would be:
$$ \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} = \frac{5 \text{ meters}}{1 \text{ second}} = 5 \text{ meters per second} $$

This shows that our average rate of change is higher in the second interval than in the first one. 

If we look at smaller and smaller intervals, we're getting closer to finding that instantaneous rate of change, which we will study using calculus later on.
