Sure! Let's break this down together.

We're looking at the graph of the line given by the equation $$2y + 3x = 7$$. Our goal is to find its x-intercept.

The x-intercept is where the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, the y value is zero. In other words, we need to find the x value when $$y = 0$$.

If we look at the graph, we see it's crossing the x-axis somewhere a bit over 2 but less than 3. It's also a bit less than 2.5. But to find the exact x value, we need to solve the equation.

Let's start by setting $$y = 0$$ in the equation:

$$
2 \cdot 0 + 3x = 7
$$

Simplifying this, we have:

$$
3x = 7
$$

Now, we solve for $$x$$ by dividing both sides by 3:

$$
x = \frac{7}{3}
$$

Is $$\frac{7}{3}$$ the value we're looking for? Let's break it down:
$$7/3$$ can be thought of as $$6/3 + 1/3$$. And since $$6/3$$ is 2, this is the same as $$2 \frac{1}{3}$$ or 2 and 1/3. This matches what we saw on the graph.

So, the x-intercept is $$\frac{7}{3}$$ or 2 and 1/3.

If you are doing this on an exercise, like on Khan Academy, it's easier to enter $$\frac{7}{3}$$ as the answer.

I hope that helps! Do you have any other questions?
