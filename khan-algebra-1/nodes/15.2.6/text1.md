Hey there! Let's chat about some fun Math concepts. We'll talk about rational and irrational numbers, and see what happens when we mix them together using different operations. Ready? Here we go!

### Rational Numbers and Division

Let's start by saying $$a$$ and $$b$$ are rational numbers, and $$b$$ is not zero (we need $$b$$ to be non-zero because we're about to divide by $$b$$). Now, is $$\frac{a}{b}$$ going to be rational or irrational?

1. Since $$a$$ and $$b$$ are rational, we can write $$a$$ as $$\frac{m}{n}$$ and $$b$$ as $$\frac{p}{q}$$, where $$m, n, p,$$ and $$q$$ are integers.
2. So, $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is the same as $$\frac{\frac{m}{n}}{\frac{p}{q}}$$.
3. When we divide by a fraction, it's the same as multiplying by its reciprocal: $$\frac{m}{n} \times \frac{q}{p} = \frac{m \cdot q}{n \cdot p}$$.
4. The product of two integers is an integer, so both $$mq$$ and $$np$$ are integers.
5. Therefore, we've shown that $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is a ratio of two integers, which makes it rational. 

So, $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is definitely rational. Neat, right?

### Irrational Numbers and Division

Now, let's switch it up and say $$a$$ and $$b$$ are irrational numbers. Is $$\frac{a}{b}$$ going to be rational or irrational?

1. Imagine $$a = 2\sqrt{2}$$ and $$b = \sqrt{2}$$.
2. Then, $$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 2$$, which is rational.
3. But what if $$a = \sqrt{2}$$ and $$b = \sqrt{7}$$?
4. Then, $$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{7}}$$, which is irrational.

So, depending on the numbers, $$\frac{a}{b}$$ can be either rational or irrational. Interesting, isn't it?

### Rational Number Times Irrational Number

Let's say $$a$$ is a non-zero rational number. What happens when we multiply $$a$$ by the square root of 8? Is it rational or irrational?

1. The square root of 8 can be written as $$2\sqrt{2}$$, which is irrational.
2. When you multiply a rational number by an irrational number, the result is always irrational.
3. So, $$a \times \sqrt{8}$$ is definitely irrational.

### Adding a Rational Number to an Irrational Number

Lastly, let $$a$$ be an irrational number. Is $$-24 + a$$ rational or irrational?

1. Suppose $$a = -\pi$$, which is roughly $$-3.14159$$.
2. Then, $$-24 + a$$ becomes $$-24 - \pi$$, which is approximately $$-27.14159$$ and is irrational.
3. Or if $$a = \sqrt{2}$$, then $$-24 + a = -24 + \sqrt{2}$$, which is also irrational.

So, whenever you add a rational number to an irrational number, the result will be irrational.
