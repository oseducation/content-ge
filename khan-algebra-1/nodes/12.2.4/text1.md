Hey there! Let's break this down together. We have an expression: $$5 \times 2^T$$, which tells us the number of leaves on a plant depending on the number of weeks since it was planted. The question is, what does the number 2 represent in this expression?

Take a moment to think about it and see if you can figure it out.

Okay, let’s look at the function a bit closer. We can write it as a function:
$$L(T) = 5 \times 2^T$$
This means the number of leaves, $$L$$, as a function of time, $$T$$, is equal to $$5 \times 2^T$$.

Let's test this. What is $$L(0)$$? This is when $$T = 0$$, which represents the moment the plant was planted. So we get:
$$L(0) = 5 \times 2^0$$

Since anything to the power of 0 is 1, this becomes:
$$L(0) = 5 \times 1 = 5$$

So, right when the plant was planted, it had 5 leaves. This "5" is called the initial value, meaning the starting amount.

Now, what about $$L(1)$$, one week after planting? That’s:
$$L(1) = 5 \times 2^1 = 5 \times 2 = 10$$

So, after one week, we have 10 leaves. This shows that from week 0 to week 1, the number of leaves doubled.

Next, let’s find $$L(2)$$, two weeks after planting:
$$L(2) = 5 \times 2^2 = 5 \times 4 = 20$$

This means the number of leaves quadrupled in two weeks. Notice how each week, the number of leaves is multiplied by 2. That’s why the number 2 is important—it’s called the "common ratio."

The common ratio tells us how much the number of leaves changes from one week to the next. 

Now, let’s look at the multiple-choice answers:

1. "There were initially two leaves on the plant." Well, we know this isn’t right because our initial value was 5 leaves, not 2.

2. "The number of leaves is multiplied by 2 each week." This matches what we observed – the leaves double each week. So, this seems correct.

3. "The plant was planted two weeks ago." We don’t have any information about when exactly the plant was planted; our function only talks about the number of weeks after planting.

So, the correct choice is that the number of leaves is multiplied by 2 each week. This means our common ratio, 2, represents the doubling of leaves each week. Neat, right?
