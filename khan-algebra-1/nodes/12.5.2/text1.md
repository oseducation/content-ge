Hey there! Let's talk about how to graph basic exponential functions. We’re looking at a function from Khan Academy: $$h(x) = 27 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^x$$. 

1. **Understanding the function**: 
   - The initial value here is 27. This means when $$x = 0$$, $$h(x)$$ will be 27.
   - The common ratio is $$\frac{1}{3}$$, which means for every step you take to the right on the graph (increasing x by 1), you multiply the value by $$\frac{1}{3}$$.

2. **Plotting points**:
   - When $$x = 0$$: 
     $$h(0) = 27 \cdot 1 = 27$$. So, one point is (0, 27).
   - When $$x = 1$$: 
     $$h(1) = 27 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 9$$. So, another point is (1, 9).

3. **Thinking about the asymptote**:
   - As $$x$$ becomes really big, like 10, 100, or even 1000, $$\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^x$$ gets really, really small, almost zero.
   - So, $$h(x)$$ will approach zero but never actually touch it. This is called a horizontal asymptote and here it’s at $$y = 0$$.

Let’s verify with another point:
- When $$x = 2$$: 
  $$h(2) = 27 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{9}\right) = 3$$. So, another point is (2, 3).

We can use these points and the asymptote to draw the graph of $$h(x)$$.

Let's do another example:

Say we have another function: $$g(x) = -30 \cdot 2^x$$.

1. **Understanding the function**:
   - The initial value is -30. When $$x = 0$$, $$g(x)$$ is -30.
   - The common ratio is 2, meaning for each step right (increasing x by 1), you multiply the value by 2.

2. **Plotting points**:
   - When $$x = 0$$: 
     $$g(0) = -30 \cdot 1 = -30$$. So, one point is (0, -30).
   - When $$x = 1$$: 
     $$g(1) = -30 \cdot 2 = -60$$. So, another point is (1, -60).

3. **Thinking about the asymptote**:
   - As $$x$$ gets really negative (like -10, -100), $$2^x$$ gets close to zero.
   - So, $$g(x)$$ will also approach zero but from the negative side. Here, the horizontal asymptote is at $$y = 0$$, but $$g(x)$$ gets closer to 0 from below.

Using these points and the idea of the asymptote, you can draw the graph of $$g(x)$$.
