Hey there! Imagine Diana the dog gets five dog biscuits for fetching each frisbee and three dog biscuits for each ball she fetches. Pretty sweet deal, right? Diana wants to get at most $$D$$ dog biscuits before she starts chasing her tail, which sounds like a good plan to me.

Now, look at the graph below: it shows all the combinations of frisbees ($$F$$) and balls ($$B$$) Diana can fetch to get at most $$D$$ dog biscuits. Our goal is to figure out what $$D$$ is, or in other words, how many dog biscuits Diana wants before she gives up and chases her tail.

First, let's understand the graph. The horizontal axis shows the number of frisbees $$F$$ she catches, and the vertical axis shows the number of balls $$B$$ she fetches. 

For each frisbee, she gets five biscuits. So, $$5F$$ is the total biscuits from frisbees. For each ball, she gets three biscuits, so $$3B$$ is the total from balls. Adding these two, the total number of biscuits Diana gets from fetching $$F$$ frisbees and $$B$$ balls is:
$$5F + 3B$$.

Now, look at the graph carefully. The points below the line represent all the combinations where Diana fetches less than or equal to $$D$$ biscuits. The maximum number of biscuits she can get is right on the line. We'll find the easiest point on this line to figure out $$D$$.

One such point is when she catches 0 frisbees and 10 balls. So, letâ€™s do the math:
- If $$B = 10$$ and $$F = 0$$,
  $$5F + 3B = 5(0) + 3(10) = 0 + 30 = 30$$ biscuits.

So, at this point, Diana would get 30 biscuits. Let's check another point for confirmation. If $$F = 6$$ and $$B = 0$$:
- $$5F + 3B = 5(6) + 0 = 30$$ biscuits.

Both points confirm that the maximum number of biscuits Diana gets before chasing her tail is 30. Therefore, $$D = 30$$. We can represent this with the inequality:
$$5F + 3B \leq 30$$.

Now, let's answer another question: Can Diana stick to her plan by fetching 4 frisbees and 2 balls? 

Calculate:
$$5(4) + 3(2) = 20 + 6 = 26$$.

Since 26 biscuits are less than the maximum 30, Diana can fulfill her plan. So, yes!
