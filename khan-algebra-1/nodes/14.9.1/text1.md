Great, let's chat about some troubles you might run into when solving a quadratic equation. Why is it called a quadratic equation? Well, it's because it has a term with $$x^2$$, which is a second-degree term. It's also an equation because it has something on both sides of an equal sign.

One common strategy people try is taking the square root of both sides. But if you take the square root of $$x^2 + 4x + 3$$ and try to equate it to the square root of -1, you’ll see problems right away. $$\sqrt{x^2 + 4x + 3} = \sqrt{-1}$$ is tricky because square roots of negative numbers are complex. Even if it was positive, you’d still hit a dead end trying to isolate $$x$$.

Another strategy is to isolate $$x^2$$ first. You might subtract 4x from both sides and subtract 3 from both sides:
$$x^2 + 4x + 3 = -1$$
becomes
$$x^2 = -4x - 4$$
Then, taking the square root of both sides gives:
$$\sqrt{x^2} = \pm \sqrt{-4x - 4}$$
But this doesn’t help much either because you still can't find $$x$$ easily. This method only works sometimes, especially if there is no $$x$$ term, like if it was just $$x^2 + 4 = -1$$.

Another common approach is factoring. When you have something like this:
$$x^2 + 4x + 3 = -1$$
you might think of two numbers that add to 4 and multiply to 3, such as 1 and 3. So you factor it to:
$$(x + 1)(x + 3) = -1$$
But just knowing the product equals -1 doesn’t solve $$x$$ directly. Factoring works better if the equation equals zero, because then you can use the zero product property:
$$(x + 1)(x + 3) = 0$$
Then $$x$$ could be -1 or -3.

If you want to use the quadratic formula, it also requires the equation to be set to zero. The formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
where $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ come from $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$. But our example doesn’t fit this yet since it equals -1, not zero. If we convert it by adding 1 to both sides:
$$x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0$$
Now you can use the quadratic formula or factor. In this case, it factors nicely:
$$(x + 2)(x + 2) = 0$$
So $$x = -2$$. 

Overall, the key tip is to always set the equation to zero to make solving easier, whether you factor or use the quadratic formula.
