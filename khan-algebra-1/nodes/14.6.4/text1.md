Sure! Let's chat about this problem step by step.

We want to find out how many solutions there are for the quadratic equation $$x^2 + 14x + 49 = 0$$.

There are a few ways we can solve this, like we could factor it or use the quadratic formula. But for now, let's use the quadratic formula and think about how it helps us find the number of solutions without solving it completely.

The quadratic formula is:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

This formula works for all quadratic equations in the form $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$. Here, $$a = 1$$, $$b = 14$$, and $$c = 49$$.

The key part to knowing how many solutions we have is the part under the square root sign: $$b^2 - 4ac$$. This part is called the *discriminant*.

- If the discriminant is greater than 0, we have two different solutions because:
  $$ \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$ and 
  $$ \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
  will give us two different numbers.

- If the discriminant is equal to 0, we have exactly one solution because adding or subtracting 0 gives the same result. So, it's like:
  $$ x = \frac{-b + 0}{2a} \text{ or } \frac{-b - 0}{2a} $$
  which both are the same: 
  $$ x = \frac{-b}{2a} $$.

- If the discriminant is less than 0, we have no real solutions because we cannot take the square root of a negative number in the real number system. 

Now, letâ€™s apply this to our problem:
- Here $$a = 1$$, $$b = 14$$, and $$c = 49$$.
- Calculate the discriminant:
  $$ b^2 - 4ac = 14^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 49 $$

- First, let's find $$14^2$$:
  $$ 14 \times 14 = 196 $$

- Next, calculate $$4 \cdot 49$$:
  $$ 4 \cdot 49 = 196 $$

- So, the discriminant:
  $$ 196 - 196 = 0 $$

Since the discriminant is 0, there is exactly one solution to the equation.

We can find this one solution:
$$ x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-14}{2 \cdot 1} = -7 $$

So, the only solution is $$x = -7$$.

You could also notice that $$x^2 + 14x + 49$$ can be factored as $$(x + 7)^2 = 0$$, which also shows that the solution is $$x = -7$$.

Does that make sense? Let me know if you have any questions!
