Alright! Let's take a look at the two different relationships between $$x$$ and $$y$$. We want to figure out if these relationships are linear, exponential, or neither.

First, let's look at the first set of points. Let's see if changing $$x$$ by a constant amount results in $$y$$ changing by a consistent amount or ratio. 

When $$x$$ increases by 3 (for each step):
- From $$-2$$ to $$5$$, $$y$$ increases by $$7$$.
- From $$5$$ to $$12$$, $$y$$ again increases by $$7$$.
- From $$8$$ to $$15$$, $$y$$ again increases by $$7$$.

So, every time $$x$$ increases by $$3$$, $$y$$ increases by $$7$$. This means we have a **linear relationship**. In a linear relationship, when $$x$$ changes by a fixed amount, $$y$$ also changes by a fixed amount.

Now, let's look at the second set of points. Here, $$x$$ increases by $$1$$ each time:
- From $$1$$ to $$3$$, $$y$$ increases by $$2$$.
- From $$3$$ to $$9$$, $$y$$ increases by $$6$$.
- From $$9$$ to $$27$$, $$y$$ increases by $$18$$.

Since $$y$$ doesn't increase by the same amount every time, it's not a linear relationship.

Next, let's check if it's an exponential relationship. In an exponential relationship, $$y$$ should multiply by a constant factor as $$x$$ increases by a constant amount.

- From $$1$$ to $$3$$, we multiply by $$3$$.
- From $$3$$ to $$9$$, we again multiply by $$3$$.
- From $$9$$ to $$27$$, we multiply by $$3$$ again.

So, when $$x$$ increases by $$1$$ each time, $$y$$ is multiplied by $$3$$. This means we have an **exponential relationship**, where $$y$$ is multiplied by the same amount each time $$x$$ increases by a fixed amount.
