Hey there! Let's break this down to understand the problem. Ksenia wants to chop both broccoli and carrots for a competition. She needs to chop at least 20 vegetables in total, but she only has 540 seconds to do it. She takes the same amount of time to chop each carrot and each broccoli head.

The graph shows all possible combinations of carrots and broccoli she can chop. Let's use two inequalities:

**Inequality A**: This represents the combinations where she chops at least 20 vegetables. The blue shaded area and the solid blue line show all possible combinations of carrots and broccoli where she chops 20 or more vegetables.

**Inequality B**: This represents the combinations she can chop within her time limit of 540 seconds. The green shaded area and the solid green line show all combinations of carrots and broccoli that she can chop without exceeding her time limit.

Now, Ksenia's goal is to find the least number of carrots she can chop while meeting both conditions: chopping at least 20 vegetables and staying within 540 seconds.

To do this, we need to look at the overlap between the blue and green areas in the graph. That overlap shows us the combinations where she meets both goals.

For the least number of carrots, you might first think about chopping 20 carrots and no broccoli, but that's not the smallest. If we look closely, the least number she can chop while still meeting both conditions is where the blue and green areas meet at one point. This point is at 10 carrots and 10 broccoli heads.

So, the minimum number of carrots Ksenia can chop to meet her goals is 10. If you tried fewer than 10 carrots, you wouldnâ€™t stay in the overlapping area that meets both conditions.

In short, by chopping 10 carrots and 10 broccoli heads, Ksenia meets both her goals of chopping at least 20 vegetables and not exceeding 540 seconds. Neat, right?
