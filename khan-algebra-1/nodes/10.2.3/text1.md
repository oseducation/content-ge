Hey there! Let's walk through this step-by-step. We have a piecewise function with different sections for different parts of \(x\). Each section behaves like a line, even with all the decimals and negative signs. Let's try to graph it together. If you have graph paper, feel free to try this on your own first!

First, let's look at the interval where \(-10 \leq x < -2\). The function here is given by $$-0.125x + 4.75$$. This is a downward-sloping line. To graph it, we'll plot the endpoints of this interval.

1. When \(x = -10\):
   \[
   -0.125 \cdot -10 + 4.75 = 1.25 + 4.75 = 6
   \]
   So, we have the point \((-10, 6)\).

2. When \(x = -2\):
   \[
   -0.125 \cdot -2 + 4.75 = 0.25 + 4.75 = 5
   \]
   But since it doesn't include \(-2\) (just approaches it), we place an open circle at \((-2, 5)\).

Now, draw a line between these two points.

Next, let's check the second interval \(-2 \leq x < -1\). Here, the function is \(x + 7\).

1. When \(x = -2\):
   \[
   -2 + 7 = 5
   \]
   So, we plot the point \((-2, 5)\) and fill it in since it includes this point.

2. When \(x = -1\):
   \[
   -1 + 7 = 6
   \]
   Similar to before, it's an open circle at \((-1, 6)\).

Now, draw a line between \((-2, 5)\) and \((-1, 6)\).

Finally, for \(-1 \leq x \leq 10\), the function is:
\[
\frac{12}{11} x + \frac{54}{11}
\]

1. When \(x = -1\):
   \[
   \frac{12}{11} \cdot -1 + \frac{54}{11} = -\frac{12}{11} + \frac{54}{11} = \frac{42}{11} = \approx 3.82
   \]
   So, point \((-1, 3.82)\), fill it in.

2. When \(x = 10\):
   \[
   \frac{12}{11} \cdot 10 + \frac{54}{11} = \frac{120}{11} + \frac{54}{11} = \frac{174}{11} \approx 15.82
   \]
   So, point \((10, 15.82)\).

And that's it! Connect these points as best as you can, paying attention to whether they are filled or open circles.

In the end, we should have a piecewise graph that clearly shows different behaviors over different intervals. Great job! If you feel like trying another example, I'm here to help!
