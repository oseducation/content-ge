Sure! Let's break this down together in simple words.

Thomas has 400 candy bars in his shop, and each candy bar costs 50 cents. We use $$p(b)$$ to show the price in dollars for buying $$b$$ candy bars. If you want to know the price of buying a certain number of candy bars, you input that number as $$b$$, and $$p(b)$$ will give you the price in dollars.

Now, let's talk about what kind of numbers we can use for $$b$$. The domain of a function means all the possible inputs for which the function is defined. So for $$p(b)$$, the domain is all the possible numbers of candy bars you can buy.

Think about it: can you buy 0.372 of a candy bar? No, because candy bars are sold as whole units, right? So you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3, up to 400 candy bars, but not fractions like 0.372. That means the domain should be whole numbers, which we call integers.

To explain it with a bit more detail, the smallest number of candy bars you can buy is 0, and the most you can buy is 400, since that's all the shop has. When we write this interval, we use brackets to show that both 0 and 400 are included in the possible numbers you can buy. So the interval for the domain is written with brackets like this: [0, 400].

In simple math terms, we say that $$b$$ is an integer between 0 and 400, including both 0 and 400.
