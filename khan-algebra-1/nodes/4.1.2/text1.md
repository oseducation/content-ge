Sure! Let's break this down together in a simple way. Let's find out which of the given pairs makes the equation true: $$ -3x - y = 6 $$.

First, remember that in an ordered pair, the first number is $$ x $$ and the second number is $$ y $$. So, for the pair $$ (-4, 4) $$, we have $$ x = -4 $$ and $$ y = 4 $$.

Let's plug these values into the equation:
$$ -3(-4) - 4 \quad \text{needs to equal} \quad 6 $$

First, multiply $$ -3 $$ and $$ -4 $$:
$$ -3 \times -4 = 12 $$

So now we have:
$$ 12 - 4 $$

Which equals:
$$ 8 $$

But, we need it to be $$ 6 $$, so this pair doesn't work.

Next, let's try the pair $$ (-3, 3) $$.

Here, $$ x = -3 $$ and $$ y = 3 $$.

Plug these into the equation:
$$ -3(-3) - 3 \quad \text{needs to equal} \quad 6 $$

First, multiply $$ -3 $$ and $$ -3 $$:
$$ -3 \times -3 = 9 $$

So now we have:
$$ 9 - 3 $$

Which equals:
$$ 6 $$

This matches our equation. So, the pair $$ (-3, 3) $$ is a solution to the equation.

Great work! Feel free to ask if you have more questions.
