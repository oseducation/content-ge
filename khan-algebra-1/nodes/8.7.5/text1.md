Hey there! Let's go over this problem together. 

Jada is ordering Mother's Day gifts online. The shipping costs depend on how much she spends. Here’s how it breaks down:
- For orders less than $20, the shipping costs $4.
- For orders $20 or more, the shipping is $7.

The question is: Can the dollar amount of the order be shown as a function of the shipping costs? Let’s dig into this!

To represent this as a function, if we input the shipping cost, we should get exactly one dollar amount of the order. 

Let's check this out with the given shipping costs:
- For shipping cost $$4$$: The order amount can be anything less than $$20$$. That means it could be $$1$$, $$1.50$$, $$7$$, or even $$19.99$$. There are many possible dollar amounts.
- For shipping cost $$7$$: The order amount has to be $$20$$ or more. So, it could be $$20$$, $$800$$, or even $$1,000,000$$. Again, there are many possible dollar amounts.

Since you get many possible dollar amounts for each shipping cost, if someone tells you the shipping cost, you can’t know exactly what the order size is. This means we can’t describe the order amount as a function of the shipping cost.

So, the answer is no, the order amount cannot be represented as a function of the shipping cost.
