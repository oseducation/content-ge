Hey there! I have a piecewise defined function here, and I'm hoping you can help me find its domain and range. 

First, let's talk about the domain. The domain is just a fancy way of saying all the possible input values (or $$x$$ values) that we can put into our function to get an output. 

Here, our input variable is $$x$$. So, we need to figure out all the $$x$$ values that make our function work. 

- When $$0 < x \leq 2$$, our function follows one rule.
- When $$2 < x \leq 6$$, our function follows a different rule.
- When $$6 < x \leq 11$$, our function follows yet another rule.

Past $$x = 11$$ or at $$x \leq 0$$, our function isn't defined. This means that we don't know what our function does for those $$x$$ values.

So to sum up, for our function to work, $$x$$ needs to be greater than 0 but less than or equal to 11. 

We can write the domain as:  
$$0 < x \leq 11$$

Next, let's think about the range. The range is the set of all possible output values (or $$f(x)$$ values) our function can take.

For this piecewise function, it only produces three possible output values: 1, 5, and -7. That means no matter what $$x$$ value you put in (as long as it's in the domain), the function will only give you 1, 5, or -7.

So we can write the range as:  
$$\{1, 5, -7\}$$

In other words, $$f(x)$$ can be 1, 5, or -7.

Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
