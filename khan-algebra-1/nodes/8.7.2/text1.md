Alright, let's see if we can figure out if $$y$$ is a function of $$x$$ based on the graph we have. 

To start, for $$y$$ to be a function of $$x$$, each input of $$x$$ should give us exactly one output of $$y$$. Think of it like a machine: you put $$x$$ into the machine, and it should give you one clear result for $$y$$. If it gives you more than one result for the same $$x$$, then it’s not working as a proper function.

Now, let’s say we have a function written as $$y = f(x)$$. If we input a value of $$x$$, we should get only one value for $$y$$. But if it spits out multiple values of $$y$$, that means we don’t know what $$f(x)$$ is exactly, because it could be any one of those values.

Let's look at our graph. The function seems to have a domain where $$x$$ is equal to $$-2$$. This means our function is only defined when $$x$$ is $$-2$$.

If we plug $$-2$$ into our function, we want to see if we get just one result for $$y$$. But when we check the graph, we see that $$x = -2$$ maps to multiple $$y$$ values. For example, the points (-2, 9), (-2, 8), (-2, 7), (-2, 7.5), and even (-2, 3.14159) are all on the graph. That’s a lot of different $$y$$ values for the same $$x = -2$$!

So, when we input $$-2$$, we don’t get a single $$y$$ value; we get an infinite number of possible values. Because it gives us many different outputs, this tells us that $$y$$ is not a function of $$x$$ on this graph.
