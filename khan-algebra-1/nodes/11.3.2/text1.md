Hey there! Let's chat about how to simplify the expression, $$3 \times \sqrt{500 \times x^3}$$. We'll also look at some comments from YouTube for new ideas on simplifying this.

First, let's review what we did before. We said that this expression is the same as $$3 \times \sqrt{500} \times \sqrt{x^3}$$.

Now, we'll do it a bit differently to make it interesting. We can break $$500$$ into $$10^2 \times 5$$ because $$500 = 100 \times 5$$ and $$100 = 10^2$$. So, the expression becomes:
$$3 \times \sqrt{10^2 \times 5} \times \sqrt{x^2 \times x}$$.

Next, we notice that:
- $$\sqrt{10^2} = 10$$, and 
- For the $$\sqrt{x^2}$$ part, if $$x$$ can be negative, we use the absolute value and write $$\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$$, just to be safe.

So, putting it together, we have:
$$3 \times 10 \times \sqrt{5} \times |x| \times \sqrt{x}$$,
which simplifies to:
$$30 \times |x| \times \sqrt{5x}$$.

And this is what we got in the last video. However, there's an interesting point about the values $$x$$ can take, known as the domain.

If we only work with real numbers (not complex ones), $$x$$ must be greater than or equal to $$0$$. Why? If you plug in a negative number into $$x^3$$, it stays negative, and taking the square root of a negative number doesn't give a real number.

So, with $$x \geq 0$$, $$|x| = x$$. Therefore, the expression becomes:
$$30x \times \sqrt{5x}$$.

But if we were dealing with complex numbers (don't worry if this is new to you), the absolute value would still be needed. For now, just remember:
- For real numbers, use $$30x \times \sqrt{5x}$$.

I hope this helps you understand better! Feel free to ask more questions.
