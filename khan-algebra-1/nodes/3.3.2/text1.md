Hey there! Let's break down the problem Ricky has with his road trip in simple words.

Ricky's trip is 100 kilometers long, and he drives at an average speed of 70 kilometers per hour. His car uses one liter of fuel to drive five kilometers. The fuel costs 0.60 dollars per liter, which is the same as 60 cents per liter.

Here's what we need to do:

1. Figure out how much fuel Ricky will use for the trip.
2. Multiply that amount by the cost per liter of fuel to find out the total cost.

First, let's see how much fuel Ricky needs. He will drive 100 kilometers. Since his car goes five kilometers for every liter, we can find out how many liters he needs by doing this:

$$ \text{Fuel used} = \frac{100 \text{ kilometers}}{5 \text{ kilometers per liter}} $$

When we divide 100 by 5, we get 20 liters. So, Ricky's car will use 20 liters of fuel for the trip.

Next, we calculate the cost. Since each liter of fuel costs 0.60 dollars, we multiply the number of liters by the cost per liter:

$$ \text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ liters} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars per liter} $$

When we multiply 20 by 0.60, we get 12 dollars. So, the cost of fuel for Ricky's trip is 12 dollars.

We didn't actually use the information about his speed (70 kilometers per hour) to solve the problem. We only needed to know how much fuel his car uses per kilometer, which is given by the fuel efficiency (five kilometers per liter).

I hope that helps! Just remember to break the problem down step by step.
