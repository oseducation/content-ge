Sure! Let's walk through this step by step together.

We have a table of values for two functions: a linear function $$f(x)$$ and an exponential function $$g(x)$$. The linear function is in the form $$f(x) = mx + b$$, and the exponential function is in the form $$g(x) = a \cdot r^x$$. Our goal is to find the equations for each function.

To begin, let's focus on the linear function $$f(x)$$. To find the equation of a line, we need two pieces of information: the slope (m) and the y-intercept (b).

First, we can find the y-intercept by looking at the value of $$f(x)$$ when $$x = 0$$:

$$f(0) = m \cdot 0 + b = b$$.

From the table, we see that $$f(0) = 5$$, so:

$$b = 5$$.

Next, we find the slope (m). The slope is the change in y (or $$f(x)$$) over the change in x. To calculate this, we'll use two points from the table. Let's use the points (0, 5) and (1, 7):

$$m = \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(1) - f(0)}{1 - 0} = \frac{7 - 5}{1 - 0} = 2$$.

Now we know the slope (m) is 2. So the equation for $$f(x)$$ is:

$$f(x) = 2x + 5$$.

Next, let's find the equation for the exponential function $$g(x)$$. We need to determine the values of $$a$$ and $$r$$.

We start by finding $$a$$, which is the initial value when $$x = 0$$:

$$g(0) = a \cdot r^0 = a$$,

From the table, we see that $$g(0) = 3$$, so:

$$a = 3$$.

Now, we use another value from the table to find $$r$$. Let's use the point where $$x = 1$$ and $$g(1) = 2$$:

$$g(1) = 3 \cdot r^1 = 3r$$,

From the table, we know that:

$$3r = 2$$,

Solving for $$r$$, we get:

$$r = \frac{2}{3}$$.

So the equation for $$g(x)$$ is:

$$g(x) = 3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^x$$.

Let's summarize:

- The linear function is $$f(x) = 2x + 5$$.
- The exponential function is $$g(x) = 3 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^x$$.
