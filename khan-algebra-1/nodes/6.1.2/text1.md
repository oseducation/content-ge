Sure! Let's go through this together in a fun and simple way:

We left off last time on our big adventure: we need to get to the castle and save someone important. But first, we have to cross a bridge, and there's a troll there. He gave us some clues because we don't have any money. And if we can't solve his riddle, he's going to push us into the water! So, we need to work under pressure. 

In the last lesson, we did pretty well. We turned his clues into a system of equations. This time, let's see if we can solve these equations. There are many ways to do this, but we'll do it visually because it helps us understand better.

First, let's draw some axes. We'll draw an f-axis (that's for the number of $5 bills) and a t-axis (that's for the number of $10 bills). Imagine that on the f-axis, 500 means 500 fives and 1000 means 1000 fives. On the t-axis, 500 means 500 tens and 1000 means 1000 tens.

Alright, let's think about all the combinations of fives (f) and tens (t) that satisfy the first equation. If we have no tens, then we need 900 fives. So, that's the point where t = 0 and f = 900. On the other hand, if we have no fives, we need 900 tens. So, that's where t = 900 and f = 0.

All these combinations form a line. I'll draw it as a dotted line. This line shows all the possible fives and tens that satisfy the first clue.

But we're not done yet. We have a second clue. Let's see what happens here. If we have no tens, then $$5f = 5500$$. Let’s make a little table:

- For the second equation:
  - If $$t = 0$$, then $$5f = 5500$$, so $$f = 1100$$. 
  - If $$f = 0$$, then $$10t = 5500$$, so $$t = 550$$.

Let’s plot these points. When $$t = 0$$, $$f = 1100$$. That’s a point on the line for the second clue. When $$f = 0$$, $$t = 550$$. That’s another point on the line.

Now, every point on this blue line shows combinations of fives and tens that satisfy the second clue.

To find the answer, we need to find the point where the two lines meet. This point gives us the number of fives and tens that fit both clues. 

Looking at our graph, where the lines intersect, it seems like we have about 700 fives and 200 tens.

Let’s check if this is right:
- 700 + 200 = 900
- 5 times 700 is $3500 (for the fives)
- 10 times 200 is $2000 (for the tens)
- Adding these together, we get $5500. 

So, it looks like we figured it out! We can tell the troll that he has 700 $5 bills and 200 $10 bills. The troll is so impressed that he lets us cross the bridge and continue our adventure!

Great job solving the troll’s riddle!
