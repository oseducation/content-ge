Hey there! Today, we're going to talk about sequences. You might have already come across sequences before. If not, you can always check out videos on Khan Academy to get a better idea. Our main focus will be on how we can create the same sequence using different functions and domains. Let’s dive into an example to make this clear.

Imagine we have a sequence: 6, 12, 24, 48, and so on. This could be the sequence you are considering. The first term here is 6. Some people might call 6 the zeroth term. The second term is 12, the third is 24, and the fourth is 48, and it goes on like that.

Now, let’s see how we can create this sequence using different functions. Notice that each term is 6 times a power of 2. We can write it like this:
- 6 is \(6 \times 2^0\)
- 12 is \(6 \times 2^1\)
- 24 is \(6 \times 2^2\)
- 48 is \(6 \times 2^3\)

From this, one way to define the sequence is by using a function \(a(n)\) where \(n\) represents the position or term number in the sequence. We can write:

\[
a(n) = 6 \times 2^n
\]

Here, \(n\) starts at 0 and increases by 1. It's important to say that \(n\) is an integer starting from 0 because if we use a non-integer or start from a different number, we won’t get the same sequence.

But this is not the only way we can define this sequence. Let’s try another function, \(b(n)\). Suppose we want to start at \(n = 1\). We can write:

\[
b(n) = 6 \times 2^{(n-1)}
\]

Here, \(n\) starts at 1. When \(n = 1\), we have:

\[
b(1) = 6 \times 2^{(1-1)} = 6 \times 2^0 = 6
\]

For \(n = 2\):

\[
b(2) = 6 \times 2^{(2-1)} = 6 \times 2^1 = 12
\]

Even though the functions and their domains are different, they produce the same sequence!

We can also define the sequence using a different way called recursion. In a recursive sequence, each term is based on the previous term. For our sequence, each term is twice the previous term. We can write:

\[
t(0) = 6
\]

and for \(n \geq 1\),

\[
t(n) = 2 \times t(n-1)
\]

This means:
- \(t(1) = 2 \times t(0) = 2 \times 6 = 12\)
- \(t(2) = 2 \times t(1) = 2 \times 12 = 24\)

If you want to start at \(n = 1\), you can adjust it:

\[
t(1) = 6
\]

with \(n \geq 1\):

\[
t(n) = 2 \times t(n-1)
\]

So, there are different ways, using normal functions or recursion, to define the same sequence. The key point is to think about the domain; it changes how we define the sequence.

I hope this makes the concept clearer for you! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
