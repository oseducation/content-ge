Alright, let's figure out if each x-value is in the domain of the function \( f \). Here's the function definition for \( f(x) \). Take a moment to try it on your own before we do it together. 

First, let's review what it means for an x-value to be in the domain of \( f \). If you can plug \( x \) into the function and get a valid result, then \( x \) is in the domain. If the function gives an undefined result, then \( x \) isn't in the domain.

Let's start with \( x = -5 \). Is it in the domain of \( f \)? 
We'll evaluate \( f(-5) \): 
\[ f(-5) = \frac{-5 + 5}{-5 - 3} = \frac{0}{-8} \]
The numerator is zero, and the denominator is \(-8\). This simplifies to 0, which is a valid number. So, \( x = -5 \) is in the domain of \( f \).

Next, let's check \( x = 0 \). Pause and try to figure it out. 
\[ f(0) = \frac{0 + 5}{0 - 3} = \frac{5}{-3} = -\frac{5}{3} \]
This simplifies to \(-\frac{5}{3}\), which is valid. So, \( x = 0 \) is in the domain of \( f \) too.

Now, let's see what happens with \( x = 3 \). Pause and try it yourself. 
\[ f(3) = \frac{3 + 5}{3 - 3} = \frac{8}{0} \]
We get a zero in the denominator here. Division by zero isn't defined in math, so \( x = 3 \) is not in the domain of \( f \).

Let's do another example with function \( g \). Check if each x-value is in the domain of \( g \).

First, \( x = -3 \). 
\[ g(-3) = \sqrt{3 \cdot (-3)} = \sqrt{-9} \]
We can't take the square root of a negative number in this context, so \( x = -3 \) is not in the domain.

Next, \( x = 0 \). 
\[ g(0) = \sqrt{3 \cdot 0} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \]
This is a valid result, so \( x = 0 \) is in the domain.

Lastly, \( x = 2 \). 
\[ g(2) = \sqrt{3 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{6} \]
\(\sqrt{6}\) is a valid number, so \( x = 2 \) is in the domain.

One more example with function \( h \). We need to see if these x-values are in the domain.

First, \( x = -1 \). 
\[ h(-1) = (-1 - 5)^2 = (-6)^2 = 36 \]
This gives us 36, a valid number, so \( x = -1 \) is in the domain.

Next, \( x = 5 \). 
\[ h(5) = (5 - 5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \]
This simplifies to zero, which is valid. So, \( x = 5 \) is in the domain.

Lastly, \( x = 10 \). 
\[ h(10) = (10 - 5)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \]
This gives us 25, a valid result, so \( x = 10 \) is in the domain.

And we're done!
