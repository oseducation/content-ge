Sure thing! Let's break this down together in simple words:

We know that the box has a volume of 405 cubic units. This could be in any unit like cubic feet, meters, centimeters, or even miles, but let's just keep it as "units".

The length of the box is $$x$$ units, the width is $$x + 4$$ units, and the height is 9 units. Let’s visualize it: 

Imagine a box where the length is $$x$$, the width is $$x + 4$$, and the height is 9. We're asked to find the dimensions of the box. We also know the volume, which is 405. 

The formula for the volume of a box is:
$$\text{volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}$$

So, we have:
$$405 = x \times (x + 4) \times 9$$

To solve for $$x$$, we first write the equation as:
$$405 = 9x \times (x + 4)$$

Expanding it:
$$405 = 9x^2 + 36x$$

To make it easier to solve, we'll move everything to one side of the equation:
$$9x^2 + 36x - 405 = 0$$

Now, let's simplify it by dividing everything by 9:
$$x^2 + 4x - 45 = 0$$

Next, we need to factor this equation. We're looking for two numbers that multiply to -45 and add to 4. Those numbers are 9 and -5. 

So, we factor it as:
$$(x + 9)(x - 5) = 0$$

For the product to be zero, either:
$$x + 9 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 5 = 0$$

This means:
$$x = -9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 5$$

However, we can't have a negative dimension for the length, so $$x = -9$$ is not valid in our real-world context.

Therefore, $$x = 5$$ is the valid solution. Let’s check the dimensions:
- The length is 5 units
- The width is $$5 + 4 = 9$$ units
- The height is 9 units

To confirm, let's calculate the volume:
$$5 \times 9 \times 9 = 405$$

So, the dimensions that work are:
- Length: 5 units
- Width: 9 units
- Height: 9 units

Great job working through this!
