Hey there! Today, I want to show you why the square root of 2 is an irrational number. To do that, I’m going to use something called a “proof by contradiction.” This means we start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove. So, our goal is to prove that the square root of 2 is irrational, but let's start by assuming the opposite: that the square root of 2 is rational. We will then see if this leads us to a contradiction, proving our initial assumption wrong. 

So, let’s assume that the square root of 2 is rational. If it’s rational, we can write it as a fraction of two whole numbers, say $$\frac{a}{b}$$, where $$a$$ and $$b$$ have no common factors other than 1. In other words, $$\frac{a}{b}$$ is in its simplest form. This is important for our proof. 

If $$\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$$, we can square both sides to get:

$$
2 = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
$$

By multiplying both sides of the equation by $$b^2$$, we get:

$$
2b^2 = a^2
$$

This equation tells us that $$a^2$$ is twice $$b^2$$. Since $$b^2$$ is a whole number, $$2b^2$$ is an even number, which means $$a^2$$ must also be even. 

If $$a^2$$ is even, then $$a$$ must be even. That’s because only an even number squared is even. Let’s say $$a$$ is equal to $$2k$$ for some whole number $$k$$. 

So, we replace $$a$$ with $$2k$$ in our equation to get:

$$
2b^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2
$$

Then we divide both sides by 2:

$$
b^2 = 2k^2
$$

This tells us that $$b^2$$ is also even, which means $$b$$ is even, too. 

But here’s the problem: we started by saying that $$a$$ and $$b$$ have no common factors other than 1. However, we just found out that both $$a$$ and $$b$$ are even, which means they both have 2 as a common factor. This is a contradiction because we assumed that $$\frac{a}{b}$$ was in simplest form. 

Since our assumption that the square root of 2 is rational led to a contradiction, the opposite must be true: the square root of 2 is irrational. 

And there you have it! We’ve shown that the square root of 2 cannot be written as a simple fraction of two whole numbers. It’s irrational!
