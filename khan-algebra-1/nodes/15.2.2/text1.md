Hey there! Let's talk about a neat proof that shows if you take a rational number and multiply it by an irrational number, you'll always get an irrational number. Why don't you pause for a moment and see if you can figure it out yourself?

Here's a hint: try using a proof by contradiction. This means we'll assume that a rational number times an irrational number somehow gives us a rational number, and then we'll see where that leads us. If we find that something doesn't make sense, we'll know our assumption was wrong. Ready? Let's dive in!

Start by assuming that a rational number times an irrational number gives you a rational number. Let's write that down:

- A rational number can be written as the ratio of two integers, $$\frac{a}{b}$$.
- An irrational number, we'll call it $$x$$.

We are saying that:
$$\frac{a}{b} \times x = \frac{m}{n}$$ 

Here, $$\frac{m}{n}$$ is another rational number. Now, let's try to solve for $$x$$.

Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of $$\frac{a}{b}$$, which is $$\frac{b}{a}$$:

$$x = \frac{m \cdot b}{n \cdot a}$$

Notice that if $$m$$, $$b$$, $$n$$, and $$a$$ are all integers, then $$\frac{m \cdot b}{n \cdot a}$$ is a ratio of two integers. This would make $$x$$ appear as a rational number.

But wait! We started by assuming that $$x$$ is an irrational number. Yet, our assumption leads us to the conclusion that $$x$$ is rational. That's a contradiction!

Because this contradiction happened, it means our original assumption must be false. So, a rational number times an irrational number must be irrational.

Hope that helps! Feel free to ask more questions if you have any.
