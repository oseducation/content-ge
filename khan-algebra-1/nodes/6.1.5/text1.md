Hey there! Let's get some practice setting up systems of linear equations from a word problem. We’re not going to solve them just yet, but we’ll make sure we can set them up correctly.

So here's the problem:

Lauren mixes dark roast beans and light roast beans to make coffee at her cafe. She needs a total of 80 kilograms of beans for her next order. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, and light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram. Someone wants to spend $220 in total. Let's use $$D$$ for the kilograms of dark roast beans and $$L$$ for the kilograms of light roast beans.

From this info, we need to create a system of equations with two unknowns, $$D$$ and $$L$$. Try pausing for a moment and see if you can set up the equations.

All right, let's do it together. 

First, we know she needs 80 kilograms of beans in total. This can be written as:
$$
D + L = 80
$$

This means the kilograms of dark roast beans plus the kilograms of light roast beans add up to 80.

Now, we need another equation. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she plans to spend $220 total. 

To figure out the total cost, we calculate how much Lauren spends on dark and light roast beans and add them up:

For the dark roast beans:
$$
3D
$$
For the light roast beans:
$$
2L
$$

When we add these together, it should equal $220:
$$
3D + 2L = 220
$$

So now we have our two equations:
$$
\begin{cases}
    D + L = 80 \\
    3D + 2L = 220
\end{cases}
$$

There you go! These two equations can now be solved to find out the right number of dark and light roast beans Lauren should use. The important part was understanding how to use the given info to set up the equations. Solving them is another fun task you can try on your own!
