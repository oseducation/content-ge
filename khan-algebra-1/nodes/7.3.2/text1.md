Sure! Let's break it down together.

Ezra loves gardening. Each sunflower plant needs 0.7 liters of water, and each lily plant needs 0.5 liters. Ezra has 11 liters of water in total. 

Here's the inequality we use:

$$0.7S + 0.5L \leq 11$$

where $$S$$ is the number of sunflower plants and $$L$$ is the number of lily plants.

Now, if Ezra decides to water 10 lily plants, we can plug in $$L = 10$$ into the inequality. This is how it looks:

$$0.7S + 0.5 \times 10 \leq 11$$

Watering 10 lily plants uses:

$$0.5 \times 10 = 5$$ liters of water.

So now, we change the inequality to:

$$0.7S + 5 \leq 11$$

Next, let's isolate $$S$$:

1. Subtract 5 from both sides:
$$0.7S \leq 6$$

2. Divide both sides by 0.7:
$$S \leq \frac{6}{0.7}$$

This division gives:
$$S \leq \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57$$

Since Ezra can only water whole plants, the most sunflower plants he can water is 8. So, with the remaining water, Ezra can water up to 8 sunflower plants.

Hope that makes more sense now! Feel free to ask if you have more questions.
