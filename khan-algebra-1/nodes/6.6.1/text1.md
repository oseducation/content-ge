Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step together. Imagine we're chatting, and I'm here to help you understand this. Here we go!

We're given this information: in 40 years, Imran will be 11 times as old as he is right now. The question we're trying to answer is: how old is Imran right now?

First, letâ€™s start by calling his current age $$x$$. So, $$x$$ is the unknown we're trying to figure out.

Next, we think about his age in 40 years. In 40 years, he will be his current age plus 40. So we can write that as $$x + 40$$.

The problem tells us that in 40 years, his age will be 11 times his current age. This means that $$x + 40$$ will be 11 times what $$x$$ is right now. We can write an equation to show this:

$$x + 40 = 11x$$

Now, let's solve this equation to find $$x$$. We need to get all the $$x$$ terms on one side. We have more $$x$$ terms on the right, so let's move the $$x$$ from the left to the right. To do this, we subtract $$x$$ from both sides:

$$x + 40 - x = 11x - x$$

This simplifies to:

$$40 = 10x$$

To find $$x$$, we divide both sides by 10:

$$x = \frac{40}{10} = 4$$

So, Imran is 4 years old right now.

Finally, let's check our answer to make sure it's correct. If Imran is 4 years old right now, then in 40 years, he will be:

$$4 + 40 = 44$$

And 44 is indeed 11 times 4. So it all fits!

Imran is 4 years old. Great job!
