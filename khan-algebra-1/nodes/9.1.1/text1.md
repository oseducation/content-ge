Hey there! Let's chat about something cool in Math called sequences. A sequence is just an ordered list of numbers. Let me give you an example.

We can have a sequence that stops after a few numbers, which is called a finite sequence. For example, if we start with 1 and keep adding 3, we get 1, 4, 7, and 10. This sequence stops at 10, so it's finite.

On the other hand, we can also have sequences that go on forever. These are called infinite sequences. For instance, if we start at 3 and keep adding 4, we get 3, 7, 11, 15, and so on. This goes on forever, so I'll put three dots at the end (like this: 3, 7, 11, 15, ...) to show it never stops. This is an infinite sequence.

When we keep adding the same amount each time, like in the examples above, it's called an arithmetic sequence. Don't worry about the fancy name; it just means we keep adding the same number over and over.

Now, let's talk about how to write these sequences using some different methods. 

### Finite Sequence Example

Take that finite sequence (1, 4, 7, 10). We can show the steps like this:
- $$a_1 = 1$$
- $$a_2 = 4$$
- $$a_3 = 7$$
- $$a_4 = 10$$

Here, the numbers $$a_1, a_2, a_3,$$ and $$a_4$$ are the terms in our sequence. 

Another way to write them is using a formula. For our sequence, if we start at 1 and keep adding 3, we can use:
$$a_k = 1 + (k-1) \times 3$$

This means:
- For $$k=1$$: $$a_1 = 1 + (1-1) \times 3 = 1$$
- For $$k=2$$: $$a_2 = 1 + (2-1) \times 3 = 4$$
- For $$k=3$$: $$a_3 = 1 + (3-1) \times 3 = 7$$
- For $$k=4$$: $$a_4 = 1 + (4-1) \times 3 = 10$$

### Infinite Sequence Example

Now, take that infinite sequence (3, 7, 11, 15, ...). We can write:
- $$a_1 = 3$$
- $$a_2 = 7$$
- $$a_3 = 11$$
- $$a_4 = 15$$
- And so on...

Using a similar formula:
$$a_k = 3 + (k-1) \times 4$$

This means:
- For $$k=1$$: $$a_1 = 3 + (1-1) \times 4 = 3$$
- For $$k=2$$: $$a_2 = 3 + (2-1) \times 4 = 7$$
- For $$k=3$$: $$a_3 = 3 + (3-1) \times 4 = 11$$
- And it keeps going...

### Recursive Definitions

Another interesting way to define sequences is by using something called recursion. Here, each term is defined based on the previous one.

For our finite sequence (1, 4, 7, 10):
- Start with $$a_1 = 1$$
- Then, $$a_k = a_{k-1} + 3$$ for the next terms.

So,
- $$a_2 = a_1 + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4$$
- $$a_3 = a_2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$$
- $$a_4 = a_3 + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10$$

For our infinite sequence (3, 7, 11, 15, ...):
- Start with $$a_1 = 3$$
- Then, $$a_k = a_{k-1} + 4$$ for the following terms.

So,
- $$a_2 = a_1 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7$$
- $$a_3 = a_2 + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11$$
- And so on...

I hope this makes sequences clear and fun! If you have any questions or want more examples, just let me know!
