Sure! Let's chat about this Math challenge using simple words.

You've just returned from saving the prince or princess and brought them back to their father, the King. The King is so happy that he wants to have a brunch party in your honor. But he has a problem: he needs to figure out how many cupcakes to order. He doesn't want to waste any but wants to make sure there's enough for everyone.

You ask him, "What's the problem?"

The King explains, "Adults eat a different number of cupcakes than children do. In my kingdom, each adult always eats the same amount, and each child always eats the same amount."

You say, "Okay, King. What information can you give me? I might be able to help you."

The King replies, "At the last party, we had 500 adults and 200 children, and they ate a total of 2,900 cupcakes."

You think that's interesting, but you need more information, so you ask, "Have you thrown other parties?"

The King says, "Yes, I love to throw parties. At another party, we had 500 adults and 300 children, and they ate 3,100 cupcakes."

Now you start to feel that some algebra could help. Your goal is to figure out two things: the number of cupcakes each adult eats and the number of cupcakes each child eats. Let’s call the number of cupcakes each adult eats $$a$$ and the number of cupcakes each child eats $$c$$.

Given this information, let's represent it with Math:

1. From the first party:
   $$500a + 200c = 2900$$

2. From the second party:
   $$500a + 300c = 3100$$

Now we have two equations to work with. Let's try to solve them step by step.

First, let’s rewrite the first equation:
$$500a + 200c = 2900$$

We need to find a way to eliminate one of the variables. We can subtract the second equation from the first:

$$500a + 300c = 3100$$

Let's subtract these equations:

$$(500a + 200c) - (500a + 300c) = 2900 - 3100$$

This simplifies to:
$$-100c = -200$$

Now, divide both sides by -100:
$$c = 2$$

Great! Now we know each child eats 2 cupcakes. Let’s use this information to find out how many cupcakes each adult eats. Plug $$c = 2$$ back into the first equation:

$$500a + 200(2) = 2900$$

This simplifies to:
$$500a + 400 = 2900$$

Subtract 400 from both sides:
$$500a = 2500$$

Divide both sides by 500:
$$a = 5$$

So, each adult eats 5 cupcakes. Now, based on how many adults and children will come to the brunch, you can tell the King exactly how many cupcakes to order:

- Each child will eat 2 cupcakes.
- Each adult will eat 5 cupcakes.

You have solved the King's problem! Great job!
