Sure, let's take this step by step together!

We need to rewrite the equation $$Y = \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{4}{7}$$ in standard form. The standard form of an equation is written as $$Ax + By = C$$, where $$A$$, $$B$$, and $$C$$ are whole numbers with no common factors other than one.

Okay, so let's start with our given equation: $$Y = \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{4}{7}$$.

Right now, this is in the slope-intercept form, which is written as $$Y = mx + b$$, where $$m$$ is the slope ($$\frac{2}{3}$$) and $$b$$ is the y-intercept ($$\frac{4}{7}$$).

Now, our goal is to convert it into standard form. The first thing we need to do is get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides by a common multiple of the denominators. The denominators here are 3 and 7. So, the least common multiple is 21.

Let's multiply both sides by 21:
\[ 21Y = 21 \left( \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{4}{7} \right) \]

When we distribute the 21 on the right-hand side:
\[ 21Y = 21 \cdot \frac{2}{3}x + 21 \cdot \frac{4}{7} \]

Next, we simplify each term:
\[ 21Y =  \left( 21 \div 3 \cdot 2 \right) x + \left( 21 \div 7 \cdot 4 \right) \]
\[ 21Y = 7 \cdot 2x +  3 \cdot 4 \]
\[ 21Y = 14x + 12 \]

Now that we have no fractions, we want all terms on one side to match the standard form $$Ax + By = C$$. So, we will move $$14x$$ to the left side by subtracting $$14x$$ from both sides:
\[ 21Y - 14x = 12 \]
or
\[ -14x + 21Y = 12 \]

Finally, let's check if $$14$$, $$21$$, and $$12$$ have any common factors other than one. They don't, so our equation is in its simplest form.

Our standard form equation is:
\[ -14x + 21Y = 12 \]

Great, we did it!
