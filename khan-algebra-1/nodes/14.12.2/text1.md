Sure! Let's go through this together step by step:

First, we want to find out which quadratic has the lowest maximum value. We'll check each one and compare.

Let's start with the first one, $$h(x)$$. We can look at its graph. The highest point, or maximum, happens when $$x = 4$$. At this point, $$h(4)$$ is equal to -1. So, the maximum value of $$h(x)$$ is -1.

Next, let's look at $$g(x)$$. We have some given points to help us. The highest value given is 5, and this happens when $$x = 0$$. So, the maximum value of $$g(x)$$ is 5.

Now, the last one is $$f(x)$$. It's given as an expression: $$f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 1$$. To find the maximum, we need to do some work, and weâ€™ll use "completing the square".

Starting with $$f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 1$$, we want to make it easier by factoring out the negative sign: $$f(x) = -(x^2 - 6x) + 1$$. 

Next, we'll complete the square. We look at the coefficient of $$x$$, which is -6. Half of -6 is -3, and squaring -3 gives us 9. We add and subtract this 9 inside the parenthesis to keep the value the same: $$f(x) = -(x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9) + 1$$.

This simplifies to: $$f(x) = -(x - 3)^2 + 9 + 1 \rightarrow f(x) = -(x - 3)^2 + 8$$.

To find the maximum value, we look at $$-(x-3)^2$$, which will always be less than or equal to 0 because a square is never negative. So the highest value of this term happens when it equals 0, which is when $$x = 3$$. Plugging in $$x = 3$$, we get $$f(3) = 8$$. So, the maximum value of $$f(x)$$ is 8.

Comparing all the maximum values:
- $$h(x) = -1$$
- $$g(x) = 5$$
- $$f(x) = 8$$

So, the quadratic with the lowest maximum value is $$h(x)$$ with -1.
