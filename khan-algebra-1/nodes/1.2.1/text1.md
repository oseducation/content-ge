Let's imagine you work at a restaurant and you make $10 per hour. On top of that, you also get some tips each hour. The total amount you make in an hour can be written like this: $$10 + \text{tips}$$.

Now, the amount of tips you get can change a lot from one hour to the next. For example, during lunchtime, you might get a lot of tips because more people are eating and spending more money. But in the next hour, there might be very few customers, so your tips might be really low.

So, the "tips" part of our expression is something that can changeâ€”it's a variable. Let's see how this works with some numbers:

1. If it's lunchtime and you get $30 in tips, then your total earnings for that hour would be:
    $$10 + 30 = 40$$
   You would make $40 that hour.

2. But if the restaurant is not busy and you only get $5 in tips, then your total earnings for that hour would be:
    $$10 + 5 = 15$$
   You would make $15 that hour.

As you can see, the total amount you make each hour depends on the tips, which can change.

In algebra, instead of writing out whole words like "tips," we use simpler symbols or letters. So, instead of $$10 + \text{tips}$$, we can write $$10 + t$$, where $$t$$ stands for the tips you get in an hour.

Let's use this shorter form:

1. If $$t$$ is 30 (you make $30 in tips), then:
    $$10 + t = 10 + 30 = 40$$

2. If $$t$$ is 5 (you make $5 in tips), then:
    $$10 + t = 10 + 5 = 15$$

We didn't have to use the letter $$t$$. We could use any symbol or letter to stand for tips, like $$x$$ or even a star $$\star$$. But using a letter like $$t$$ helps us understand it better.

So, a variable is just a symbol that can stand for different values. And that's why we call it a "variable" because it can vary.
