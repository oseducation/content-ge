Sure! Let's chat about how to figure out how many solutions a system of linear equations has. I'll break it down step by step.

First, you can think of it graphically. There are three possibilities:
1. If the lines are the same, they overlap completely, so there are an infinite number of solutions.
2. If the lines are parallel, they never meet, which means there are no solutions.
3. If the lines cross at exactly one point, there is just one solution.

But instead of drawing them, let's solve it using algebra.

### Example 1:
The first equation is $$5x - 9y = 16$$. Let's change the second equation so that we can cancel out the $$x$$ terms when we add them.

Our second equation is $$5x - 9y = 16$$. If we multiply it by $$-1$$, we get $$-5x + 9y = -36$$.

Now, add the two equations:
$$5x - 5x + (-9y + 9y) = 16 - 36$$

This simplifies to:
$$0 = -20$$

This is clearly not true, so there are no solutions. This means the lines are parallel and never meet.

### Example 2:
This time, our system is:
$$-6x + 4y = 2$$
Let's manipulate the second equation by multiplying by $$2$$ to cancel out $$x$$:
$$3x - 2y = -1 \rightarrow 6x - 4y = -2$$

When you add the equations:
$$-6x + 6x + (4y - 4y) = 2 + (-2)$$

This simplifies to:
$$0 = 0$$

This is always true. So, we have infinitely many solutions because the lines are the same.

### Example 3:
If solving a system leads you to something like $$-5 = 20$$, that's also clearly not true. It means there are no solutions, and the lines are parallel again.

### Example 4:
If your solution steps lead you to $$5y = -5$$, you can find $$y$$ by dividing both sides by 5:
$$y = -1$$

Substitute $$y = -1$$ back into the system to get the value of $$x$$, and you'll find one unique solution.

### Example 5:
If solving steps lead you to $$0 = 0$$ again, it means infinite solutions because it's always true.

So, in these examples:
- A false statement like $$0 = -20$$ or $$-5 = 20$$ means no solutions.
- A true statement like $$0 = 0$$ means infinite solutions.
- Specific values for $$x$$ and $$y$$ like $$y = -1$$ mean there is exactly one solution.

I hope this makes it clearer! Feel free to ask if you have more examples or questions.
