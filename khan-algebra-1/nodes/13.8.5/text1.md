Hey there! Let's take a look at this problem together. We have a quadratic expression, $$x^2 + 5x + c$$, which is a perfect square. This means we can factor it as $$(x + d)^2$$. Here, both $$c$$ and $$d$$ are positive rational numbers. Our goal is to figure out the values of $$c$$ and $$d$$ based on this information. Ready? Let's dive in!

We start with the expression $$x^2 + 5x + c$$ and we're saying it can be written as $$(x + d)^2$$. So, write down:

$$x^2 + 5x + c = (x + d)^2$$.

To expand the right side, we get:

$$(x + d)^2 = x^2 + 2dx + d^2$$.

If this part seems tricky, I suggest checking out some videos on squaring binomials or perfect square polynomials to see the patterns clearly.

Now, comparing both expressions, we can see:

1. The $$x^2$$ terms are the same.
2. The middle term $$5x$$ should be equal to $$2dx$$.
3. The constant term $$c$$ should be equal to $$d^2$$.

From $$5x = 2dx$$, we can solve for $$d$$:

$$2d = 5 \implies d = \frac{5}{2}$$.

Great! We found that $$d = \frac{5}{2}$$. Next, we need to find $$c$$, which is $$d^2$$. So,

$$c = d^2 = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{4}$$.

And there you have it! 
- $$d = \frac{5}{2}$$ 
- $$c = \frac{25}{4}$$. 

We did it! I hope this helps you understand the problem better. ðŸ˜Š
