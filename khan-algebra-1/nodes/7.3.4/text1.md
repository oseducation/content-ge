Sure thing! Let's break this down step-by-step in a friendly chat.

Hey there! Let's work on this problem together. So, Luis has a $25 gift card to buy digital music and games. Each song costs $0.89 and each game costs $1.99. He wants to get at least 15 items. We need to make a system of inequalities to show this and then see the possible ways Luis can use his gift card.

First, let's pick some variables:
- Let $$s$$ be the number of songs.
- Let $$g$$ be the number of games.

Luis wants to buy at least 15 items. So, the equation for the number of items is:
$$s + g \geq 15$$

Next, we know he can't spend more than $25. The cost equation would be:
$$0.89s + 1.99g \leq 25$$

To graph these, we'll use a coordinate system. We'll only use the first quadrant because Luis can't buy negative songs or games. Here's how we do it:

1. **Draw the Axes:**
   - The vertical axis (up and down) is for the number of songs, $$s$$.
   - The horizontal axis (left to right) is for the number of games, $$g$$.

2. **Mark the Scale:**
   - Let's make each box equal to 2 units to fit larger numbers.

3. **Graph the First Constraint:**
   - For $$s + g \geq 15$$:
     - When $$g = 0$$, $$s \geq 15$$. So, at $$g = 0$$, point is $$(15, 0)$$.
     - When $$s = 0$$, $$g \geq 15$$. So, at $$s = 0$$, point is $$(0, 15)$$.
     - Draw a line through these points and shade above the line because we want the values greater than or equal to 15.

4. **Graph the Second Constraint:**
   - For $$0.89s + 1.99g \leq 25$$:
     - When $$s = 0$$, solve for $$g$$: 
       $$1.99g = 25 \Rightarrow g \approx 12.56$$
     - When $$g = 0$$, solve for $$s$$: 
       $$0.89s = 25 \Rightarrow s \approx 28.08$$
     - Draw a line from $$(0, 12.56)$$ to $$(28.08, 0)$$ and shade below the line because we want the values less than or equal to 25.

5. **Find the Overlap:**
   - The solution is where the shaded areas from the two inequalities overlap. This area shows the combinations of songs and games Luis can buy.

For example:
- If he buys 4 games ($$g = 4$$), he can buy 16 songs ($$s = 16$$) which is 4 games + 16 songs = 20 items ($$20 \geq 15$$) and costs $24.36 ($$0.89 \times 16 + 1.99 \times 4$$).
- If he buys 2 games ($$g = 2$$), he can buy 18 songs ($$s = 18$$) which is 2 games + 18 songs = 20 items ($$20 \geq 15$$) and costs $21.22 ($$0.89 \times 18 + 1.99 \times 2$$).

And that's it! With this, we can see all possible combinations Luis can choose to use up his gift card wisely.
