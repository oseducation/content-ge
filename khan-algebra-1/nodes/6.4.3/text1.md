Sure! Let's break this down together and figure out if Scarlett or Hansol has a system of equations that matches the teacher's. An equivalent system means it has the same solution or solutions.

Let's start with Scarlett's work. Scarlett's second equation is:

$$14x - 7y = 2$$

The teacher’s corresponding equation is:

$$14x - 7y = 7$$

Notice that both equations have the same $$x$$ and $$y$$ terms, but different constants. This tells us that the lines are parallel. 

Let's break this equation down to see why. We can change the teacher's equation into a form that shows the slope and $$y$$-intercept. By rearranging the teacher's equation:

$$
14x - 7y = 7 \\
-7y = -14x + 7 \\
y = 2x - 1
$$

Now, let's do the same for Scarlett's equation:

$$
14x - 7y = 2 \\
-7y = -14x + 2 \\
y = 2x - \frac{2}{7}
$$

Both lines have the same slope (2), but different y-intercepts (-1 and $$-\frac{2}{7}$$). This means they are parallel and never meet. So Scarlett's system does not match the teacher’s because they have no common solutions.

Next, let's look at Hansol's work. Hansol's second equation is:

$$5x - y = -6$$

The teacher’s equation is:

$$5x - y = 3$$

Again, the $$x$$ and $$y$$ terms are the same, but the constants are different. This also means these lines are parallel and do not intersect. No common solutions here either.

So, neither Scarlett nor Hansol has a system equivalent to the teacher's. Both have parallel lines in their systems, meaning there are no points where these lines meet.
