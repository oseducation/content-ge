Hey there! If you've ever watched a movie where someone is showing off their math skills on a chalkboard, you've probably seen a special symbol that looks like this: $$\sqrt{}$$. This symbol is called the radical and it’s used to show the square root. But what does this really mean?

Now that we know a bit about exponents, let's break it down. We know that $$3^2$$ means $$3$$ times $$3$$, which equals $$9$$. But what if we start with $$9$$ and ask, "What number times itself equals $$9$$?" The answer is $$3$$. The radical symbol helps us express this. So, the square root of $$9$$ is written as $$\sqrt{9}$$ and equals $$3$$.

Notice these two important ideas:
- The square root of $$9$$ is asking "What squared equals $$9$$?" The answer is $$3$$.
- And, $$3^2$$ equals $$9$$. 

We can do this with other numbers as well:
- $$4^2$$ equals $$16$$, so the square root of $$16$$ is $$\sqrt{16}$$, which equals $$4$$.
- What about $$25$$? The square root of $$25$$ is $$\sqrt{25}$$, which equals $$5$$, because $$5^2$$ equals $$25$$.

You might wonder, "What about negative numbers?" If we square $$-3$$, we also get $$9$$. The same goes for $$-4$$ and $$16$$, or $$-5$$ and $$25$$. So why isn't the square root of $$9$$ negative $$3$$? By convention, when we see the radical symbol, it usually refers to the principal (main) square root, which is the positive one. 

For example:
- Negative square root of $$9$$ is written as $$-\sqrt{9}$$ and equals $$-3$$.

Both $$\sqrt{9} = 3$$ and $$-\sqrt{9} = -3$$ are correct, but the first one is the principal (positive) root.

To make it more general, if we write $$\sqrt{9} = x$$, then $$x$$ can only be $$3$$ because it’s the positive root. But if we write $$x^2 = 9$$, then $$x$$ can be either $$3$$ or $$-3$$ because both satisfy the equation.

Sometimes, to include both solutions, we use $$\pm\sqrt{9} = x$$ which means $$x$$ can be $$3$$ or $$-3$$.

I hope that clears things up! Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further examples.
