Sure! Let's break it down together. So, we have the equation:

$$ 7 - \frac{10}{x} = 2 + \frac{15}{x} $$

At first, this might seem different from the equations you're used to. But don't worry, we can simplify it. The main problem here is the $$ x $$ in the denominators. So let's handle that.

Whenever there’s an $$ x $$ in the denominator, we can multiply the whole equation by $$ x $$ to get rid of those fractions. Remember, if we multiply one side, we must multiply both sides to keep the equation balanced.

So, let's multiply both sides by $$ x $$:

$$ x \cdot (7 - \frac{10}{x}) = x \cdot (2 + \frac{15}{x}) $$

Distributing the $$ x $$ on both sides gives us:

$$ 7x - 10 = 2x + 15 $$

Now, it's starting to look more like a regular equation we know how to solve. We need to get all the $$ x $$ terms on one side. Let’s subtract $$ 2x $$ from both sides:

$$ 7x - 2x - 10 = 15 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ 5x - 10 = 15 $$

Next, we’ll get rid of the $$ -10 $$ by adding $$ 10 $$ to both sides:

$$ 5x - 10 + 10 = 15 + 10 $$

Which simplifies to:

$$ 5x = 25 $$

Now, we’re almost there! To solve for $$ x $$, divide both sides by 5:

$$ x = 5 $$

Let’s check to make sure this solution works. Going back to our original equation:

$$ 7 - \frac{10}{5} $$ should be equal to $$ 2 + \frac{15}{5} $$.

This simplifies to:

$$ 7 - 2 = 2 + 3 $$

And both sides equal 5, so the solution is correct! 

Well done!
