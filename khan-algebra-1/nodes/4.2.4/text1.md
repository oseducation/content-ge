Hey there! Let's figure out the slope of the line that goes through these points together. Before we jump in, try solving it on your own first if you can. Ready? Okay, let's get into it. 

First, let’s remind ourselves what slope means. The slope is the "change in y" divided by the "change in x." We use a symbol that looks like a triangle, $$ \Delta $$, to mean "change." So, slope can be written as $$ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$ or $$ \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$. Here, $$ (x_1, y_1) $$ is our starting point and $$ (x_2, y_2) $$ is our ending point.

We can choose any two points, assuming they are part of a line. Let’s take the first two points as an example. 

First, find the change in x:
- If we go from x = 2 to x = 3, the change in x is $$ 3 - 2 = 1 $$.

Next, find the change in y:
- If we go from y = 4 to y = 1, the change in y is $$ 1 - 4 = -3 $$.

Now, we have everything we need:
- The slope is $$ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-3}{1} = -3 $$. So, the slope here is -3.

Let’s try another example together. What’s the slope of a line that has different points? Again, see if you can work it out first.

Remember, the slope is $$ \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$. 

Let’s pick any two points for variety. We’ll use the middle two this time:
- To find the change in x from x = 1 to x = 5, it's $$ 5 - 1 = 4 $$.
- To find the change in y from y = 7 to y = 13, it's $$ 13 - 7 = 6 $$.

So, the change in y is 6, and the change in x is 4. Therefore:
- The slope is $$ \frac{6}{4} $$ which we can simplify. Both 6 and 4 can be divided by 2, so our slope is $$ \frac{6 \div 2}{4 \div 2} = \frac{3}{2} $$.

And there you go! The slope is $$ \frac{3}{2} $$.

Great job! Keep practicing, and slopes will become easier and easier for you.
