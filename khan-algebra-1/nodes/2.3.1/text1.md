Sure! Let's walk through the steps together to determine how many solutions each of these equations has. 

Before we dive into the equations, let's remind ourselves about the possible types of solutions we might encounter:
1. **One solution:** This occurs when you can simplify the equation to something like $$x =$$ some number (e.g., $$x = 5$$). This means there's only one specific value for $$x$$ that makes the equation true.
2. **No solutions:** This happens when, through legitimate steps, you end up with something impossible, like $$3 = 5$$. Since no value of $$x$$ can make such a statement true, the equation has no solutions.
3. **Infinite solutions:** This occurs when any value of $$x$$ satisfies the equation. For example, ending up with $$5 = 5$$, which is always true no matter what $$x$$ is.

Okay, now let's look at the given equations:

### First Equation
1. Start with the given equation.
2. Subtract 2 from both sides to simplify:
    $$
    -7x = 2x - 9x
    $$
    $$
    -7x = -7x
    $$
3. This statement is always true for any $$x$$, so we have infinite solutions.

### Second Equation
1. Start with the next equation:
    $$
    -7x + 3 = -7x + 2
    $$
2. Add 7x to both sides to see what happens:
    $$
    3 = 2
    $$
3. This is impossible because 3 can never equal 2, so this equation has no solutions.

### Third Equation
1. Simplify the given equation by subtracting 3 from both sides:
    $$
    -7x = 2x - 1
    $$
2. Subtract 2x from both sides:
    $$
    -9x = -1
    $$
3. Divide both sides by -9:
    $$
    x = \frac{1}{9}
    $$
4. We found a specific value for $$x$$ that satisfies the equation, so there is exactly one solution.

By working through each equation, we determined the number of solutions for each one:
- The first equation has infinite solutions.
- The second equation has no solutions.
- The third equation has exactly one solution.

Great job working through these with me!
