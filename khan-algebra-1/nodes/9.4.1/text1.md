Sure, let's break this down step-by-step so it's easy to understand. Ready? Let's go!

Okay, so we have a table with several values for $$N$$: $$N = 1, 2, 3, 4$$ and the matching values for $$G(N)$$. 

We can think of this function $$G$$ as a sequence where $$N$$ is the position in the sequence. So, for example, the sequence looks like this:

- First term: 168
- Second term: 84
- Third term: 42
- Fourth term: 21

And it continues like that. 

Now, let's think about what type of sequence this is. We start with 168, and to get from 168 to 84, we can either subtract 84 or multiply by 0.5 (which is the same as multiplying by one half). Doing it this way:

- From 168 to 84: $$168 \times \frac{1}{2}$$
- From 84 to 42: $$84 \times \frac{1}{2}$$
- From 42 to 21: $$42 \times \frac{1}{2}$$

Since we are multiplying by the same number (0.5) each time, this is a geometric sequence. We start with a term and then keep multiplying by what we call the "common ratio" (0.5 here).

So, how can we write $$G(N)$$ explicitly using $$N$$? Letâ€™s pause and think about it. We're starting at 168 and multiplying by 0.5 a certain number of times.

- For the first term ($$N = 1$$), we multiply by 0.5 zero times.
- For the second term ($$N = 2$$), we multiply by 0.5 once.
- For the third term ($$N = 3$$), we multiply by 0.5 twice.
- For the fourth term ($$N = 4$$), we multiply by 0.5 three times.

So, the number of times we multiply by 0.5 is $$N - 1$$.

Thus, we can define $$G(N)$$ like this: $$G(N) = 168 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{N-1}$$

When $$N = 1$$, we get $$1 - 1 = 0$$, and $$\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^0 = 1$$, so $$G(1) = 168 \times 1 = 168$$.

When $$N = 2$$, we get $$2 - 1 = 1$$, and $$\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^1 = 0.5$$, so $$G(2) = 168 \times 0.5 = 84$$.

And it continues like this.

Another way to write it is: $$G(N) = \frac{168}{2^{N-1}}$$.

Using properties of exponents, we can also write it a bit differently: 
$$G(N) = 168 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{N-1} = 168 \times 2 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^N = 336 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^N$$. Both forms are correct and mean the same thing.

But we can also define this function recursively. Recursion means defining something in terms of itself. So, let's do that:

For $$N = 1$$, $$G(1) = 168$$. 

For $$N > 1$$, $$G(N) = \frac{1}{2} \times G(N-1)$$.

You can check to see this makes sense:
- For $$N = 2$$, $$G(2) = \frac{1}{2} \times G(1) = \frac{1}{2} \times 168 = 84$$.
- For $$N = 3$$, $$G(3) = \frac{1}{2} \times G(2) = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42$$.

So, here we have two ways to describe this sequence: explicitly and recursively. Both are useful in different situations!

I hope this makes sense! Feel free to ask more questions if you have any.
