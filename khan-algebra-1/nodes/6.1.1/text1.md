Hey there! Imagine you're in a magical land, trying to get to a castle to save someone important. There's a river you can't swim across, so you need to use a bridge. But uh-oh, a troll appears! This troll is kind, sort of. He says you need to pay $5 to cross, and there's even a sign saying so. But guess what? You don’t have any money! 

Luckily, the troll offers a chance. He'll let you cross if you solve a riddle. The troll tells you he only takes $5 and $10 bills. He has 900 bills in total, and if you add up all his money, it equals $5,500. Your task is to figure out how many $5 and $10 bills he has.

First, let's check if this puzzle can be solved. Yes, it can be! We’ll use a bit of math to do it.

Let's call the number of $5 bills $$f$$, and the number of $10 bills $$t$$. 

The troll told us:
1. He has a total of 900 bills.
2. The total value of all his bills is $5,500.

We can write these facts as equations:

1. $$f + t = 900$$ (Total number of bills)
2. $$5f + 10t = 5500$$ (Total value of the bills)

We have two equations and two unknowns, $$f$$ and $$t$$. This set of equations is called a "system of equations." Using both equations together, we can find out how many $5 and $10 bills the troll has.

Think of it like this: just using one piece of info doesn't tell us enough. But using both, we can figure out how many of each type of bill there are. 

Let’s solve this together and cross that bridge safely!
