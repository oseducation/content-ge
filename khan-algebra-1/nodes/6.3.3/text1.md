Of course! Let's make this easy and chat about solving these math equations together.

Hi there! ðŸ˜Š We've got two math equations to work with here. The first equation is $$X - 4Y = -18$$, and the second one is $$-X + 3Y = 11$$. Our goal is to find values for $$X$$ and $$Y$$ that work for both equations at the same time. This is called solving the system.

First, let's think about what this means. Each equation has lots of possible $$X$$ and $$Y$$ pairs (solutions) that make it true. If you draw these solutions on a graph, you get a line for each equation. Where these lines cross is where both equations are true at the same time. So, we need to find that crossing point.

Let's rewrite the first equation: 
$$X - 4Y = -18$$

When we solve these equations, we can change them in the same way on both sides, and their equality will still hold true. Our aim here is to get rid of one of the variables (either $$X$$ or $$Y$$) to make it easier.

If we add the second equation, $$-X + 3Y$$, to the first one, we get:
$$X - 4Y + (-X + 3Y) = -18 + 11$$

The $$X$$ and $$-X$$ cancel each other out, leaving:
$$-Y = -7$$
If we divide or multiply both sides by -1, we get:
$$Y = 7$$

Now, we know $$Y$$ is 7. Let's find $$X$$. We can use either equation. Let's use the first one:
$$X - 4(7) = -18$$
$$X - 28 = -18$$
Add 28 to both sides to solve for $$X$$:
$$X = 10$$

So, the values that work for both equations are $$X = 10$$ and $$Y = 7$$. This pair, $$(10, 7)$$, is our solution.

If you substitute $$Y = 7$$ back into the second equation:
$$-X + 3(7) = 11$$
$$-X + 21 = 11$$
Subtract 21 from both sides:
$$-X = -10$$
$$X = 10$$

You see, it works for both equations! These values make both equations true.

To understand this better, imagine drawing these equations as lines on a graph. They cross each other at the point $$(10, 7)$$. This point is the solution to our system because it works in both equations.

I hope that helps! Feel free to ask if you have more questions! ðŸ˜Š
