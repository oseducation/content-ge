Sure, here's the simplified version:

Hey there! So, we're looking at Adam flying his remote-controlled drone from a platform. There's a function $$f$$ that shows the height of the drone in meters over time in seconds after takeoff. 

We're going to plot points on the graph for some specific things. Try to do it yourself first â€“ you can't really draw on your screen, but you can use your finger to point to the correct part on the graph. This is from a Khan Academy exercise.

First, let's find the height of the platform. The drone starts at the platform height right when it takes off. That means at time $$t = 0$$ seconds, the height is 60 meters. So, the height of the platform is 60 meters. Easy, right? That point tells us the platform is 60 meters high.

Next, let's look at the drone's highest point. As time goes on, the drone goes up, up, and up until it reaches 80 meters. This happens at 10 seconds. So, the highest point the drone reaches is 80 meters at 10 seconds.

Finally, we need to find when the drone lands on the ground. The ground is at a height of 0 meters. We see that this happens at $$t = 30$$ seconds. 

Now, you might notice that there's another point where the height is zero, at $$t = -10$$ seconds. But since time can't go backward, negative time doesn't make sense here. We should focus only on times from $$t = 0$$ onward. So, we don't consider the negative time part when thinking about the drone's takeoff and landing.

Does that make sense?
