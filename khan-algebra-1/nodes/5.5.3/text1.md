Hey there! We've talked about the standard form of a linear equation before, and today I want to clear up some differences you might see in different classes about what exactly "standard form" means.

Everyone agrees that the standard form looks something like $$A \cdot x + B \cdot y = C$$, where $$A$$, $$B$$, and $$C$$ are numbers. So if you see an equation like $$3x + 4y = 10$$ or $$2x + 5y = -10$$, that's definitely standard form.

But if you see something like $$3x = -4y + 10$$ or $$y = 3x + 7$$, those are not in standard form, even though they are equivalent equations.

Now, there are some small differences in opinion about what counts as standard form. For instance, if you see $$6x + 8y = 20$$, some people might say this isn't standard form because the numbers (6, 8, and 20) can all be divided by 2. They would say you need to simplify it to $$3x + 4y = 10$$. But on Khan Academy, we don't worry about that. We just want you to use the form $$A \cdot x + B \cdot y = C$$, without checking for common factors.

Some people also prefer that the first number (the coefficient of $$x$$) should be positive. So while we at Khan Academy consider $$-3x - 4y = -10$$ as standard form, others might not because the number in front of $$x$$ is negative.

Another example is if the numbers in the equation are not whole numbers. So $$1.25x + 5.50y = 10.5$$ might not be seen as standard form by some because the numbers aren't whole. But for us, that's okay too.

We at Khan Academy accept all these forms because sometimes the equation has specific meanings that are easier to understand in its original form, especially when solving real-life problems.

So remember, for Khan Academy, as long as it looks like $$A \cdot x + B \cdot y = C$$, it's in standard form. But be aware that in other places, you might need to watch out for common factors, the sign of the first number, and whether the numbers are whole.
