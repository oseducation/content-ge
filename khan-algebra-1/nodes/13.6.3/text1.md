Sure, let's go through this step-by-step together. We want to factor $$-12f^2 - 38f + 22$$. A good starting point is to check if there are any common factors for all three terms. When we look, we can see they are all even numbers. Also, we usually don't like to have a negative sign out front, so let's factor out $$-2$$ from the expression.

Let's do the division:

- $$-12f^2 \div -2 = 6f^2$$,
- $$-38f \div -2 = 19f$$,
- $$22 \div -2 = -11$$.

So, the expression becomes:

$$-2 (6f^2 + 19f - 11)$$.

Now, we will focus on factoring $$6f^2 + 19f - 11$$. Since we don't have a $$1$$ as the coefficient of $$f^2$$, we'll use a method called "factoring by grouping." To do this, we need to find two numbers that multiply to $$6 \times -11 = -66$$ and add up to $$19$$.

Let's try some numbers. We need two numbers that multiply to $$-66$$ and add up to $$19$$. 

How about $$22$$ and $$-3$$? 

- $$22 \times -3 = -66$$,
- $$22 + (-3) = 19$$.

So, we can break down $$19f$$ into $$22f$$ and $$-3f$$:

$$6f^2 + 19f - 11 = 6f^2 + 22f - 3f - 11$$.

Next, we group the terms:

$$(6f^2 + 22f) + (-3f - 11)$$.

Now, let's factor out the common factors from each group separately. From $$6f^2 + 22f$$, we can factor out $$2f$$:

$$2f(3f + 11)$$.

From $$-3f - 11$$, we can factor out $$-1$$:

$$-1(3f + 11)$$.

Now, our expression looks like this:

$$2f(3f + 11) - 1(3f + 11)$$.

Since both groups contain $$(3f + 11)$$, we can factor that out:

$$(3f + 11)(2f - 1)$$.

And don't forget that $$-2$$ we factored out at the beginning:

$$-2(3f + 11)(2f - 1)$$.

So, the factored form of $$-12f^2 - 38f + 22$$ is:

$$-2(3f + 11)(2f - 1).$$

And that's it! We've successfully factored the expression. If you have any questions or need more help, just let me know!
