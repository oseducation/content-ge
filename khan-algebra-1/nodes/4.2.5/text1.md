Sure! Let's go through this step-by-step together and find the slope of the line that goes through the points \((4, 2)\) and \((-3, 16)\).

First, let's recall what slope means. Slope is like the steepness of a hill. It's how much you go up or down (rise) for each step you take sideways (run). We can remember it as "rise over run." 

In math symbols, slope is often shown with the letter $$m$$ and it’s calculated using the change in $$y$$ over the change in $$x$$. This is written as:

$$
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
$$

Here, $$\Delta y$$ (the change in $$y$$) means how much the $$y$$ values differ, and $$\Delta x$$ (the change in $$x$$) means how much the $$x$$ values differ. 

Let’s use these points: (4, 2) and (-3, 16).
- Our starting point \((x_1, y_1) = (4, 2)\)
- Our ending point \((x_2, y_2) = (-3, 16)\)

To find the change in $$x$$:

$$
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = -3 - 4 = -7
$$

This means we moved 7 steps to the left (since it's negative). 

To find the change in $$y$$:

$$
\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 16 - 2 = 14
$$

This means we moved 14 steps up. 

Putting these into our slope formula:

$$
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{14}{-7} = -2
$$

So, the slope is -2.

Let's also try it the other way around, starting at \((-3, 16)\) and ending at \((4, 2)\):
- Our starting point \((x_1, y_1) = (-3, 16)\)
- Our ending point \((x_2, y_2) = (4, 2)\)

To find the change in $$x$$ this way:

$$
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 4 - (-3) = 4 + 3 = 7
$$

This means we moved 7 steps to the right (since it's positive). 

To find the change in $$y$$:

$$
\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 2 - 16 = -14
$$

This means we moved 14 steps down. 

Putting these into our slope formula:

$$
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-14}{7} = -2
$$

Again, we get the same slope: -2.

This confirms that no matter which point we start from, the slope will always be -2. If you sketch this on a graph, you'll see the line going downwards from left to right, showing that as $$x$$ gets bigger, $$y$$ gets smaller.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
