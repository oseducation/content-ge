Sure, let's go through this step by step together!

We need to find the value(s) of $$x$$ that satisfy two conditions:

1. $$5x - 3$$ is less than 12.
2. $$4x + 1$$ is greater than 25.

Since it's an "and" situation, $$x$$ has to meet both of these conditions at the same time.

First, let's deal with the inequality $$5x - 3 < 12$$. We want to find out what $$x$$ can be, so we'll isolate $$x$$. We start by getting rid of the -3. The way we do this is by adding 3 to both sides of the inequality:

$$ 5x - 3 + 3 < 12 + 3 $$

On the left side, the -3 and +3 cancel out, leaving us with:

$$ 5x < 15 $$

Next, we'll divide both sides by 5 to solve for $$x$$:

$$ \frac{5x}{5} < \frac{15}{5} $$

This simplifies to:

$$ x < 3 $$

So, one condition is that $$x$$ must be less than 3.

Now, let's work on the second inequality: $$4x + 1 > 25$$. Similarly, we start by getting rid of the +1 by subtracting 1 from both sides:

$$ 4x + 1 - 1 > 25 - 1 $$

On the left side, the +1 and -1 cancel out, leaving us with:

$$ 4x > 24 $$

Next, we'll divide both sides by 4 to solve for $$x$$:

$$ \frac{4x}{4} > \frac{24}{4} $$

This simplifies to:

$$ x > 6 $$

So, the second condition is that $$x$$ must be greater than 6.

Because it is an "and" situation, $$x$$ has to be both less than 3 and greater than 6 at the same time. But if we think about this, we realize it's not possible for a number to be both less than 3 and greater than 6 at the same time. If you look at the number line, there is no overlap between the numbers that are less than 3 and those that are greater than 6.

So, because there is no number that can satisfy both conditions at once, the solution to this problem is that there is no solution.
