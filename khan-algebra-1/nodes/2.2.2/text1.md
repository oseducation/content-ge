Hey there! Today we're going to explore an interesting concept related to equations called "equivalence" or "equivalent statements." We've solved many equations before, but let's now understand what's really happening. 

First, let’s think about the word "equivalence." It means that two statements are essentially the same for any value of the variable. I'll show you by using an example equation and rewriting it in different but equivalent ways, okay? 

Check out this equation:

$$3(X + 1) - X = 9$$

One way to rewrite this equation is by distributing the 3 to both the $$X$$ and the $$1$$ inside the parentheses:

$$3X + 3 - X = 9$$

Now, this new equation is equivalent to the original one. If you find a value of $$X$$ that makes the original equation true, it will also make this new one true. 

Let's combine like terms next. The $$3X$$ and $$-X$$ add up to:

$$2X + 3 = 9$$

This equation is also equivalent to the first two. Here’s a cool thing: You can do several operations that preserve equivalence, meaning these operations won't change the truth of the equation. For example, subtracting 3 from both sides:

$$2X + 3 - 3 = 9 - 3$$

This simplifies to:

$$2X = 6$$

Again, this maintains equivalence. Every solution for this new equation will solve the original one. Another common operation is dividing or multiplying both sides by a non-zero number. Let's divide both sides of:

$$2X = 6$$

by 2:

$$\frac{2X}{2} = \frac{6}{2}$$

which simplifies to:

$$X = 3$$

If $$X = 3$$ works here, it works in all the previous equations. 

But what if we didn't do the same operation on both sides? That messes up the equivalence. For example, if we start with:

$$ X = 2 $$

and just add one to one side:

$$X + 1 = 2$$

This equation isn't equivalent to $$X = 2$$ because it doesn't make $$X = 2$$ true anymore!

Another tricky part is dividing by a variable that could be zero. It's dangerous because dividing by zero is undefined. For example, look at:

$$5X = 6X$$

If you think of dividing both sides by $$X$$, you might get:

$$5 = 6$$

which makes no sense! Instead, subtract $$5X$$ from both sides:

$$5X - 5X = 6X - 5X$$

It simplifies to:

$$0 = X$$

This correctly keeps the equivalence. 

Remember, multiplying by zero also messes things up. For instance:

$$2X = 6$$

If you multiply both sides by zero, you get:

$$0 = 0$$

which is always true but doesn't tell us about $$X$$ anymore! 

So, keep in mind:
1. Adding or subtracting the same number on both sides preserves equivalence.
2. Multiplying or dividing by non-zero values preserves equivalence.
3. Be careful with zero, and dividing by variables can be tricky if they could be zero.

These rules help keep our equations true and make solving them much easier. Cool, right?
