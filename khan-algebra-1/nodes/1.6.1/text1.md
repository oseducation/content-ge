Hey there! So, there's this funny comedian named Steven Wright who once said, "Black holes are where God divided by zero." While we won't dive into the physics behind it, there's actually a neat connection between black holes and the idea of dividing by zero in math. 

Black holes represent places where our understanding of physics breaks down, and dividing by zero is where math doesn’t make any sense. When you see something "undefined" in math, it might seem odd or confusing, but it basically means that math experts haven't figured out a good way to explain it. 

Let's talk about why dividing by zero is "undefined." If you try to divide any non-zero number by zero, like $$\frac{7}{0}$$ or $$\frac{8}{0}$$, you'll find that math just can’t give a clear answer. Let’s try to figure out what could happen when we divide by a number really, really close to zero.

Let's start with the number 1 and divide it by smaller and smaller positive numbers:
- $$\frac{1}{0.1} = 10$$
- $$\frac{1}{0.01} = 100$$
- $$\frac{1}{0.000001} = 1,000,000$$

As the number we divide by gets smaller, our result gets bigger and bigger, reaching towards positive infinity. So it might seem like $$\frac{1}{0}$$ could be positive infinity.

But what happens when we divide by negative numbers close to zero?

- $$\frac{1}{-0.1} = -10$$
- $$\frac{1}{-0.01} = -100$$
- $$\frac{1}{-0.000001} = -1,000,000$$

In this case, as the negative numbers get closer to zero, our result goes towards negative infinity. So you could also argue that $$\frac{1}{0}$$ might be negative infinity.

Because there isn’t a single clear answer—and the answers can wildly differ—mathematicians decided it’s best to call division by zero "undefined." It’s not that they couldn't just pick a number, like 42, but any choice wouldn’t fit well with the rest of math.

So, when we see "undefined," it simply means there's no good, consistent way to define that operation. And that’s why dividing by zero is considered undefined in math!
