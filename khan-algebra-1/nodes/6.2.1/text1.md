Hey there! 

Remember when you were figuring out the potato chip problem in the last video? Well, imagine this: the king’s favorite magical bird flies over and starts whispering something to the king. You feel a bit unsure and ask the king what the bird is saying. The king tells you that the bird thinks there's another way to solve the problem. You’re not used to taking advice from birds, so you kind of challenge it, saying, "If the bird knows so much, let it solve the problem."

The bird keeps whispering to the king, and the king translates for you. The bird suggests using one of the equations to solve for a variable. Let’s say we use the blue equation to solve for a variable. This will make one variable depend on another.

To solve for $$m$$, we subtract $$400w$$ from both sides:  
$$100m = 1100 - 400w$$ 

Next, we divide everything by 100:  
$$m = -4w + 11$$

So now, we have expressed $$m$$ in terms of $$w$$. The bird, with the king’s help, suggests substituting this expression into the first equation to only have one variable to solve for.

Here’s what this looks like in the first equation:  
$$200(-4w + 11) + 300w = 1200$$

Do you see what we did there? Everywhere we saw an $$m$$, we replaced it with $$-4w + 11$$.

Now, the king writes out the math. We distribute the 200:  
$$200 \cdot (-4w) + 200 \cdot 11 + 300w = 1200$$  
$$-800w + 2200 + 300w = 1200$$

Next, we combine like terms:  
$$-800w + 300w = -500w$$  
$$-500w + 2200 = 1200$$

Now we subtract 2200 from both sides:  
$$-500w = -1000$$

Dividing both sides by -500, we get:  
$$w = 2$$

Wow, we got the same answer as before when we used a different method, called elimination. This substitution method, suggested by the bird, seems to work just as well!

If you want to know how many chips the men would eat, you can substitute $$w = 2$$ back into the equation for $$m$$ and solve for $$m$$ just like last time. You can try this yourself to see that you’ll get the same result for $$m$$.

Happy solving!
