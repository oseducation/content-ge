Hey there! Moussa and Fatu were given a math problem where they had to factor the quadratic expression $$16x^2 - 64$$. Let's look at how each of them did it and figure out if they did it correctly.

First, Moussa’s approach:
Moussa started by factoring out a 16. So he wrote the expression as $$16(x^2 - 4)$$. Notice $$x^2 - 4$$ is a difference of squares, which we can factor further as $$(x + 2)(x - 2)$$. This gives us:
$$16(x^2 - 4) = 16(x + 2)(x - 2)$$

Now, let's see how Fatu did it:
Fatu saw the original expression, $$16x^2 - 64$$, as a difference of squares from the beginning. He wrote:
$$(4x)^2 - 8^2$$
This can be factored as:
$$(4x + 8)(4x - 8)$$
So, Fatu wrote the expression as:
$$(4x + 8)(4x - 8)$$

Both Moussa and Fatu got different looking factored forms, but both are correct and equivalent to the original quadratic expression $$16x^2 - 64$$. If some parts of the factoring steps don’t make sense right away, you might want to review the basic concepts of factoring and difference of squares. They both used the idea that you can break down a $$a^2 - b^2$$ into $$(a + b)(a - b)$$. Great job to both Moussa and Fatu!
