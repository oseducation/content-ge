Sure, let's go through this step by step.

First, we're given the first four numbers in an arithmetic sequence: 
$$-8, -14, -20, -26$$

To find the next number, we need to understand that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between each number is always the same. 

Let's figure out this difference. From $$-8$$ to $$-14$$, we go down by $$6$$. From $$-14$$ to $$-20$$, we again go down by $$6$$, and from $$-20$$ to $$-26$$, we go down by $$6$$ again. So, to find the next term, we just go down by $$6$$ one more time. 

So:
$$-26 - 6 = -32$$

Thus, the fifth term in this sequence is $$-32$$.

Let's try another example. Here are the first five numbers of a sequence:
$$2, -1, -4, -7, -10$$

We need to find the sixth number.

Let's check the difference between these numbers. 
- From $$2$$ to $$-1$$, we go down by $$3$$.
- From $$-1$$ to $$-4$$, we go down by $$3$$.
- From $$-4$$ to $$-7$$, we again go down by $$3$$.
- Finally, from $$-7$$ to $$-10$$, we go down by $$3$$ again.

To find the sixth term, we follow the same pattern and go down by $$3$$ from $$-10$$. 

So:
$$-10 - 3 = -13$$

Therefore, the sixth term is $$-13$$.

I hope this helps you understand how to find the next terms in an arithmetic sequence! Feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
