Hey there! Today, I want to talk with you about what a Linear Equation is. To start, let's look at some examples.

Take the equation $$y = 2x - 3$$. This is a linear equation. You might wonder why we call it a "linear" equation. Well, if you take all the $$x, y$$ pairs that make this equation true and graph them on a coordinate plane, you will see they form a straight line. 

Let's check this out by plotting some pairs. If $$x = 0$$, then $$y = 2 \cdot 0 - 3 = -3$$. So, the point $$(0, -3)$$ is on our graph. Let's do another one: if $$x = 1$$, then $$y = 2 \cdot 1 - 3 = -1$$. This gives us the point $$(1, -1)$$. If we keep going, say $$x = 2$$, then $$y = 2 \cdot 2 - 3 = 1$$, giving us the point $$(2, 1)$$.

If you were to plot these and connect the dots, you would see a straight line. This line represents all the $$x, y$$ pairs that satisfy the equation $$y = 2x - 3$$. You can try more points like $$x = -1$$ or $$x = 3$$, and you'll find they all fall on this line.

What’s cool is that no matter what value of $$x$$ you use, the $$y$$ you calculate will always lie on this line. For example, if $$x = -0.5$$, then $$y = 2 \cdot -0.5 - 3 = -4$$, which is on our line.

This point $$(x, y)$$ is a solution to our linear equation. So, if you take all pairs $$(x, y)$$ that work in the equation, you get a line. That’s why it’s called a "linear" equation.

But there are other ways to write linear equations. For instance, $$4x - 3y = 12$$ is also linear. If you graph the points that satisfy this equation, you will again get a line.

Let’s plot some points for this one. If $$x = 0$$, then $$-3y = 12$$, so $$y = -4$$, giving us the point $$(0, -4)$$. If $$y = 0$$, then $$4x = 12$$, so $$x = 3$$, giving us the point $$(3, 0)$$. These points also form a straight line when connected.

Not every equation is a linear one. For example, $$y = x^2$$ or $$xy = 12$$ are not linear—they make curves when you graph them, not lines.

So, what makes an equation linear? If graphing all the $$x, y$$ pairs gives you a line, it's linear. Another way to check is looking at each term in the equation: if they're either constants (like 12, which doesn't change) or constants multiplied by a variable (like $$2x$$ or $$-3y$$ to the first power), it's linear. 

We don't have $$x$$ or $$y$$ raised to higher powers, and we don't multiply $$x$$ and $$y$$ together. This helps keep things simple and gives us a straight line graph.
