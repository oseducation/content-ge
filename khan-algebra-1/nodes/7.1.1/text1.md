Sure! Let's break this down in a simple and friendly way. We're trying to figure out if the pairs of numbers (3, 5) and (1, -7) work as solutions to the inequality $$5x - 3y \geq 25$$. 

Let's check each pair one by one.

### Trying (3, 5)
First, we set $$x = 3$$ and $$y = 5$$ in the inequality:
$$5(3) - 3(5) \geq 25$$

Let's work this out:
$$5 \times 3 = 15$$
$$3 \times 5 = 15$$
So, it becomes:
$$15 - 15 \geq 25$$
This simplifies to:
$$0 \geq 25$$

Is this true? No, because 0 is not greater than or equal to 25. So, (3, 5) is **not** a solution.

### Trying (1, -7)
Next, let's set $$x = 1$$ and $$y = -7$$:
$$5(1) - 3(-7) \geq 25$$

Working this out:
$$5 \times 1 = 5$$
$$3 \times (-7) = -21$$
So, it becomes:
$$5 - (-21) \geq 25$$
This simplifies to:
$$5 + 21 \geq 25$$
Adding them up gives:
$$26 \geq 25$$

Is this true? Yes, because 26 is greater than 25. So, (1, -7) is a solution.

### Visualizing on a Graph
To better understand, let's graph it. We'll rewrite the inequality in a more common form:

First, subtract $$5x$$ from both sides:
$$-3y \geq -5x + 25$$

Now divide everything by $$-3$$ (remember dividing by a negative flips the inequality sign):
$$y \leq \frac{5}{3}x - \frac{25}{3}$$

This will help us draw the line on a graph. The line $$y = \frac{5}{3}x - \frac{25}{3}$$ has a y-intercept at $$-\frac{25}{3}$$ (around -8.3) and a slope of $$\frac{5}{3}$$, meaning it rises 5 units up for every 3 units it goes to the right.

The inequality $$y \leq \frac{5}{3}x - \frac{25}{3}$$ means we're looking at the area below this line, including the line itself.

When we plot our points:
- (3, 5) falls **above** this line, so it's not part of the solution.
- (1, -7) falls **below** the line, so it is part of the solution.

I hope this makes things clearer! Feel free to ask more questions if you need further explanation.
