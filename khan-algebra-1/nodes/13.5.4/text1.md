Hello! Let's break down the problem step-by-step in a simple and friendly way.

Averil is trying to factor the expression $$6x^2 - 18x + 12$$. She found that the greatest common factor (GCF) of these terms is 6 and decided to use an area model. Our goal is to find the width of Averil's area model.

Pause here and give it a try yourself first!

Ready? Let's work through it together.

First, since the GCF is 6, Averil rewrote the expression like this: 
$$
6(x^2 - 3x + 2)
$$

To understand this better, she used an area model. Imagine a rectangle where the height is 6 and the width is something we need to find. If you multiply the height (6) by the width, you should get the area, which is our original expression: $$6x^2 - 18x + 12$$.

So, how do we figure out the width? Let’s see.

The expression is divided into three parts:
1. The pink section: $$6x^2$$
2. The blue section: $$-18x$$
3. The peach section: $$12$$

These parts represent smaller areas inside our big rectangle. Let’s find the width of each section.

For the pink section:
$$6 \times \text{width} = 6x^2$$
$$\text{width} = x^2$$

For the blue section:
$$6 \times \text{width} = -18x$$
$$6 \times (-3x) = -18x$$
$$\text{width} = -3x$$

For the peach section:
$$6 \times \text{width} = 12$$
$$6 \times 2 = 12$$
$$\text{width} = 2$$

Now, to find the total width of the rectangle, we just add the widths of these sections:
$$x^2 - 3x + 2$$

So, the width of Averil’s area model is $$x^2 - 3x + 2$$. If we multiply 6 by this width, we get back our original expression:
$$6(x^2 - 3x + 2) = 6x^2 - 18x + 12$$

And there we go, we've solved it! Great job!
