Sure, I'd be happy to help with that! Let’s break it down and make it simpler.

So, we have a function \(f\) that takes an input value \(b\) and gives us an output value \(a\). This output \(a\) needs to fit in the equation 

$$4a + 7b = -52.$$

We want to write a formula that tells us what \(a\) is when we know \(b\). In other words, we need to find \(f(b)\).

First, we start with the equation:

$$4a + 7b = -52.$$

To find \(a\), we need to get \(a\) on its own on one side of the equation. So, let's move \(7b\) to the other side by subtracting \(7b\) from both sides:

$$4a = -52 - 7b.$$

Now, we need to get rid of the 4 in front of \(a\). We do this by dividing everything by 4:

$$a = \frac{-52 - 7b}{4}.$$

Let’s break that down. Dividing \(-52\) by 4 gives us \(-13\), and dividing \(-7b\) by 4 gives us \(-\frac{7}{4}b\):

$$a = -13 - \frac{7}{4}b.$$

So, our function \(f(b)\) can be written as:

$$f(b) = -13 - \frac{7}{4}b.$$

This means if you give me a value for \(b\), I can use this formula to find \(a\). Just plug in the value of \(b\) into the formula, and you'll get the corresponding value of \(a\) that fits our original equation.

I hope this makes it clear. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
