Hi there! Let's look at Meredith's homework problem together. She is trying to solve:

$$2 \times (x + 4)^2 = 242$$

Her teacher tells her the correct answers are $$x = 7$$ and $$x = -15$$, but Meredith only found $$x = 7$$. Let's figure out where she made a mistake.

First, let's see her steps. In the first step, she gets rid of the number 2 on the left side by dividing both sides by 2:

$$\frac{2 \times (x + 4)^2}{2} = \frac{242}{2}$$

This simplifies to:

$$(x + 4)^2 = 121$$

So far, she is correct. Now, to make it easier, she decides to take the square root of both sides to solve for $$x + 4$$:

$$\sqrt{(x + 4)^2} = \sqrt{121}$$

She does it right by simplifying:

$$x + 4 = 11$$

But here's where she makes an important mistake. When you take the square root of something squared, it could be positive or negative. That means:

$$x + 4 = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 4 = -11$$

By missing the negative root, she missed one solution. Let's solve both parts to make it clear:

1. $$x + 4 = 11$$: Subtract 4 from both sides to get $$x = 7$$.
2. $$x + 4 = -11$$: Subtract 4 from both sides to get $$x = -15$$.

So, Meredith should have considered both the positive and negative square roots. She made the mistake in the step where she took the square root, and because of that, she only found one solution instead of two.

Hope that helps! Keep practicing, you're doing great!
