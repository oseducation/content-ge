Sure thing! Let's walk through this step by step:

You need to find the product of $$(2x + 8) (2x - 8)$$. What we're doing here is multiplying two binomials. There are a few ways to do this, like using FOIL or the distributive property. But here, it’s important to notice a pattern.

The expression $$(a + b)(a - b)$$ has a special pattern where $$a$$ is $$2x$$ and $$b$$ is $$8$$. So our problem becomes $$(2x + 8)(2x - 8)$$, which matches the form $$(a + b)(a - b)$$.

Let’s multiply it out to see what happens. First, distribute $$(a + b)$$:

$$a \cdot (a + b)$$ and $$-b \cdot (a + b)$$.

So, we have:

$$a \cdot a$$ + $$a \cdot b$$ + $$-b \cdot a$$ + $$-b \cdot b$$.

This simplifies to:

$$a^2 + ab - ab - b^2$$.

Notice here that $$+ab$$ and $$-ab$$ cancel each other out. So, we’re left with:

$$a^2 - b^2$$.

The general pattern is that $$(a + b)(a - b)$$ equals $$a^2 - b^2$$. This is a good shortcut to know!

Now, apply it to our problem. Here, $$a = 2x$$ and $$b = 8$$. Plug these into the pattern:

$$(2x)^2 - 8^2$$.

$$(2x)^2$$ is the same as $$2^2 \cdot x^2$$, which equals $$4x^2$$.

And $$8^2$$ is $$64$$.

So, we get:

$$ 4x^2 - 64$$.

And there you have it! The product of $$(2x + 8)(2x - 8)$$ is $$4x^2 - 64$$.
