Hey there! Let's work on setting up systems of equations together. We won't solve them right now, just focus on writing them out. Here’s the information we have:

1. Sanjay's dog weighs five times as much as his cat.
2. His dog is also 20 kilograms heavier than his cat.

Let's use $$c$$ to stand for the cat's weight and $$d$$ for the dog's weight.

First, let’s look at the sentence: Sanjay's dog weighs five times as much as his cat. This means the dog's weight $$d$$ is five times the cat's weight $$c$$. We can write this as:
$$ d = 5c $$

Next, the sentence says: His dog is also 20 kilograms heavier than his cat. This tells us that the dog's weight $$d$$ is the cat's weight $$c$$ plus 20 kilograms. We write this as:
$$ d = c + 20 $$

Now we have two equations:
1. $$ d = 5c $$
2. $$ d = c + 20 $$

These equations come from the information given in the word problem. If you want a challenge, you can try solving them, but for now, we’re just practicing setting them up. With more practice, translating words into math form will feel natural. Keep it up!
