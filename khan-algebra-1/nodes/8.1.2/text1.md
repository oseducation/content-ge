Sure! Let's break this down and make it simple.

The function $$f$$ of $$x$$, written as $$f(x)$$, is defined as:
$$f(x) = 49 - x^2$$

We need to find the value of $$f(5)$$. Here's how we do it step by step:

1. We start with our function $$f(x) = 49 - x^2$$.
2. When we see an $$x$$, we will replace it with 5 since that's our input.
3. So, $$f(5)$$ means we replace $$x$$ with 5 in the function, like this:

$$f(5) = 49 - 5^2$$

4. Next, we calculate the value inside the function. First, we find $$5^2$$ which is 25.
5. Now, we subtract this 25 from 49:

$$49 - 25$$

6. When we subtract 25 from 49, we get 24.

So, $$f(5) = 24$$. And we're done!
