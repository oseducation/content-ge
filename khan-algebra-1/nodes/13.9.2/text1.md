Hey there! Let's go over some factoring tricks we talked about in the last video. We saw three examples that showed different ways to factor and when to use them.

In the first example, we just needed to spot a shared factor. Once we did that, we were done. Easy, right?

In the second example, we started by spotting that all terms were divisible by 4. After taking that out, we used a basic trick to factor what's left by finding what two numbers add up to the middle number and multiply to the last number. We were able to factor the expression that way.

In the third example, we also started by finding a common factor, which was 3 this time. We could have done it like the second example, or recognized it was a perfect square and used that trick to factor it out.

Now, let's tackle another type of polynomial. Say we have the expression: $$7x^2 - 63$$. Pause and see if you can factor this one.

All terms are divisible by 7. So, if we factor out a 7, we get: $$7(x^2 - 9)$$. This might look familiar as a difference of squares, where $$x^2 - 9$$ is actually $$x^2 - 3^2$$. If this is new to you, check out videos on factoring the difference of squares. Here, you see that it can be written as: $$x^2 - 3^2 = (x + 3)(x - 3)$$. So the whole expression is: $$7(x + 3)(x - 3)$$.

Let's do one more example. Say we have: $$2x^2 + 7x + 3$$. If the coefficient on the $$x^2$$ term isn't 1, check for common factors. Here, there aren't any since 7 and 3 aren't divisible by 2, so we'd use grouping.

Grouping involves finding two numbers that add up to the middle coefficient (7 here) and multiply to the product of the constant term (3) and the leading coefficient (2). So, $$a + b = 7$$ and $$a \cdot b = 6$$. Two numbers that fit are 1 and 6. Rewrite the expression with these numbers: $$2x^2 + 6x + 1x + 3$$.

Now, group them: $$2x^2 + 6x + 1x + 3 = (2x^2 + 6x) + (1x + 3)$$. Factor out common parts: $$2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3)$$. Then factor out $$x + 3$$: $$ (x + 3)(2x + 1)$$.

And that's it!

Factoring by grouping can seem tough, but it's just about finding two numbers that match the rules and breaking the expression into parts you can factor. If these methods don't work, you might need the quadratic formula, but that's another fun topic!

I hope this helps! Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it. Feel free to ask any questions! ðŸ˜Š
