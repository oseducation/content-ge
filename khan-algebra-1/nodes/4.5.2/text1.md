Sure, let's break it down together!

Flynn's sister loaned him some money, and he paid her back over time. Flynn made a graph showing how much time, in weeks, had passed since the loan and how much money he still owed his sister. We need to find out what part of the graph shows how long it took Flynn to pay back the loan. Take a moment and try to figure it out on your own. Once you're ready, let's look at the possible answers together.

First, let's talk about the slope. The slope of a line tells us how much the y-value (amount owed) changes for a given change in the x-value (time in weeks). For example, if one week passes, we see his debt goes from $15 to $10. So, if $$\Delta x = 1$$ week, then $$\Delta y = -5$$ dollars, showing the loan decreased by $5 each week. This rate of repayment (the slope) is constant, which is why it's a straight line. Although the slope tells us how quickly Flynn is paying back the loan, it doesn't directly tell us how long it takes to finish paying it. So the slope isn't the answer.

Next, let's look at the x-intercept. This is where the graph crosses the x-axis. It tells us the x-value (time) when the y-value (amount owed) is zero. That means no more money is owed. This directly answers the question: how long did it take Flynn to pay back the loan? Looking at the graph, we see it took Flynn four weeks to pay back the loan. So, this is the right answer.

The y-intercept is where the graph crosses the y-axis. It tells us what happens when $$t = 0$$ (the very start before any time has passed). Here, Flynn owes $20 at the beginning. While this is helpful for knowing the initial amount owed, it doesnâ€™t tell us how long it took to pay back the loan.

Since we've found the right answer, we can ignore "none of the above" as well.

So, to summarize:
- The slope tells us the rate of repayment.
- The x-intercept tells us it took 4 weeks to repay the loan.
- The y-intercept tells us Flynn owed $20 at the start.

Great job working through this!
