Sure! Let's break this down step-by-step in a simple way.

Let's see if we can factor the expression \( 45x^2 - 125 \). When I see something like this with a second-degree term and a subtraction sign, I often think about the difference of squares. We have already seen that if we have something in the form \( a^2 - b^2 \), it can be factored into \( (a + b)(a - b) \).

Let's look at our expression. It’s not obvious that \( 45x^2 \) or \( 125 \) are perfect squares. So, it doesn’t look like a difference of squares right away. But what catches my eye is that both 45 and 125 have common factors. The number that stands out to me is 5. 

Let's see if we can factor out a 5. By doing that, maybe we can get something closer to our pattern of the difference of squares.

If we factor out a 5, the expression becomes:

\[ 5 \left( \frac{45x^2}{5} - \frac{125}{5} \right) \]

So, this simplifies to:

\[ 5(9x^2 - 25) \]

Now, this is interesting! \( 9x^2 \) is a perfect square since \( (3x)^2 = 9x^2 \). And 25 is also a perfect square since \( 5^2 = 25 \).

So, if we think of \( 9x^2 \) as \( a^2 \) where \( a = 3x \), and 25 as \( b^2 \) where \( b = 5 \), we can see this fits the pattern \( a^2 - b^2 \):

\[ (3x)^2 - 5^2 \]

Using the difference of squares formula, we can factor this as:

\[ (3x + 5)(3x - 5) \]

Don’t forget the 5 we factored out in the beginning. So, the final factored form is:

\[ 5(3x + 5)(3x - 5) \]

And that’s it! We have factored \( 45x^2 - 125 \) completely.
