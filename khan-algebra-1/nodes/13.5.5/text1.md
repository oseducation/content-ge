Sure! Let's have a chat about how to factor expressions completely. Here we go:

First, let's look at this expression and work on factoring it together. Here's the expression we need to factor:

$$ 4x^2 - 8x - 12 $$

To start, let's see if there's a common factor in all the terms. The greatest common factor is 4, as all the numbers (4, -8, and -12) are divisible by 4, but not by any larger number. So, we'll factor out a 4:

$$ 4(x^2 - 2x - 3) $$

Now, we need to factor the expression inside the parentheses, $$x^2 - 2x - 3$$. We look for two numbers that add up to -2 and multiply to -3. Those numbers are -3 and 1 because:

$$ -3 + 1 = -2 $$
$$ -3 \times 1 = -3 $$

So, we can rewrite the expression as:

$$4(x - 3)(x + 1)$$

And that's it! We've completely factored it.

Let's try another example. Suppose we have the expression:

$$ -3x^2 + 21x - 30 $$

First, let's find the greatest common factor. All terms are divisible by 3. But it's better to factor out the negative as well, so we'll factor out -3:

$$ -3(x^2 - 7x + 10) $$

Next, let's focus on $$x^2 - 7x + 10$$ and find two numbers that add up to -7 and multiply to 10. Those numbers are -5 and -2 because:

$$ -5 + (-2) = -7 $$
$$ -5 \times (-2) = 10 $$

So we can rewrite the expression as:

$$ -3(x - 5)(x - 2) $$

And there you go! We've completely factored it. If you have any questions or want to try more examples, let me know!
