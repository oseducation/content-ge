Let's solve the equation $$P^2 = 0.81$$ together. How can we think about this problem? One thing we can do is to realize that if $$P^2 = 0.81$$, another way to say this is that $$P$$ equals the positive or negative square root of 0.81. When we write the square root sign, it usually means the positive square root, but in this case, $$P$$ can be positive or negative because squaring a negative number still gives a positive result.

So we can write $$P = \pm \sqrt{0.81}$$. But what exactly could $$P$$ be? 

You might immediately think of the number 81 and recognize that $$9 \times 9 = 81$$ or $$9^2 = 81$$, which means $$9 = \sqrt{81}$$. This is true for 81. But what about 0.81?

0.81 has two digits after the decimal point. If we multiply a number with one digit after the decimal point by itself, we will get a result with two digits after the decimal point. Let's see what happens if we take 0.9 and square it. 

$$0.9^2$$ means $$0.9 \times 0.9$$. 

$$9 \times 9 = 81$$, and since there are two digits after the decimal points in the numbers we multiplied, the result will be $$0.81$$. 

So, $$0.81 = 0.9^2$$. We can write $$P = \pm \sqrt{0.9^2} = \pm 0.9$$. 

In other words, $$P$$ could be $$0.9$$ or $$-0.9$$. We can verify this by squaring both numbers:

$$0.9^2 = 0.81$$ and $$(-0.9)^2 = 0.81$$. 

So, $$P = 0.9$$ or $$P = -0.9$$.
