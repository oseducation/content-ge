Alright, let’s dive into this arithmetic sequence together! We have a sequence $$a_i$$ defined by the formula $$a_i = 4 + 3 \cdot (i - 1)$$. We need to find $$a_{20}$$, which is the 20th term of the sequence.

To do this, we just plug 20 into the formula wherever we see an $$i$$. So, we get:

$$a_{20} = 4 + 3 \cdot (20 - 1)$$

Now, let's simplify it step-by-step:

$$a_{20} = 4 + 3 \cdot 19$$

We know that $$3 \cdot 19 = 57$$, so:

$$a_{20} = 4 + 57 = 61$$

So, the 20th term in the sequence is 61! Great job!

Now, let’s tackle another sequence. We have an arithmetic sequence $$a_i$$ where the first term $$a_1$$ is given as -7, and each term is defined recursively by the formula $$a_i = a_{(i-1)} - 2$$.

Our task is to find $$a_5$$, the fifth term. 

Let’s start by breaking it down step-by-step:

1. We know $$a_1 = -7$$
2. To find $$a_2$$:
   $$a_2 = a_1 - 2 = -7 - 2 = -9$$
3. Next, find $$a_3$$:
   $$a_3 = a_2 - 2 = -9 - 2 = -11$$
4. Then, find $$a_4$$:
   $$a_4 = a_3 - 2 = -11 - 2 = -13$$
5. Finally, find $$a_5$$:
   $$a_5 = a_4 - 2 = -13 - 2 = -15$$

So, the fifth term in the sequence is -15. Well done!
