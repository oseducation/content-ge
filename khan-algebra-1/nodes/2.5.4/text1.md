Sure, let’s go through this step-by-step together. 

Kayla wants to visit a friend who lives eight kilometers away. She'll take the subway as far as she can and then walk the rest of the way. First, she must buy an access pass that costs $5.50. Also, there is a fee of $1.25 per stop. This is a pricey subway ride! Kayla doesn't want to spend more than $15 on the trip. She wants to know how many stops she can afford. Let's call the number of stops $$S$$.

First, let’s think about how much she spends. No matter what, she will spend $5.50 for the access pass. Then, on top of that, she will spend $1.25 per stop. So the total cost can be written as:
$$ 5.50 + 1.25S $$

Kayla doesn’t want to spend more than $15. So we need to write an inequality to show that the total cost should be less than or equal to $15:
$$ 5.50 + 1.25S \leq 15 $$

Now, let's solve this inequality to find out the largest number of stops Kayla can afford.

First, subtract 5.50 from both sides:
$$ 1.25S \leq 9.50 $$

Next, divide both sides by 1.25 to solve for $$S$$:
$$ S \leq \frac{9.50}{1.25} = 7.6 $$

Kayla cannot take a fraction of a stop, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the largest number of stops she can take is 7.

So, Kayla can take up to 7 stops on the subway. Great job working through this with me!
