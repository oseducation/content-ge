Absolutely, let's work through that together! We're going to take an expression like $$4x + 18$$ and see if we can rewrite it as a product of two expressions. This process is called factoring. Our goal is to find what common factors exist in both $$4x$$ and $$18$$. To put it simply, we’re going to reverse the distributive property.

First, let's find the largest number that can divide both $$4x$$ and $$18$$. We know $$4x$$ is divisible by 2 because 4 can be divided by 2, and $$18$$ is also divisible by 2. 

So, we can rewrite $$4x$$ as $$2 \times 2x$$ and $$18$$ as $$2 \times 9$$. Now, it might be clearer to see how this works. If we're using the distributive property to break it down, we'd get something like this:

$$4x + 18 = 2(2x) + 2(9)$$

Now, to factor it, we pull the 2 out. This means we write it like this:

$$2(2x + 9)$$

If we were to multiply this back out, we'd get:

$$2(2x) + 2(9)$$

Which simplifies back to our original expression, $$4x + 18$$. So there we have it! We've rewritten it as the product of two expressions: $$2(2x + 9)$$.

Let's try another example. Suppose we have $$12 + 32y$$. What's the largest number that can divide both 12 and 32? 2 works for both, but so does 4. In fact, 4 is the largest number that works for both.

So, we rewrite $$12$$ as $$4 \times 3$$ and $$32y$$ as $$4 \times 8y$$. Now, just like before, we pull out the common factor of 4:

$$12 + 32y = 4(3) + 4(8y)$$

Then factor out the 4, which gives us:

$$4(3 + 8y)$$

As you practice more, this process becomes quicker. You’ll look at $$12 + 32y$$ and recognize that the largest number divisible by both is 4, then divide each term by 4 to find:

$$12 / 4 = 3$$ and $$32y / 4 = 8y$$.

So in one quick step, you can factor:

$$4(3 + 8y)$$

And that's it! It's all about finding the common factors and then rewriting the expression using those. Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it in no time!
