Sure! Let's chat about this problem together.

The function $$m$$ is given to us in three different forms. We need to find out which form shows the $$y$$-intercept the quickest. 

First, let's remind ourselves. If we have a function, the graph is $$y = m(x)$$. All the forms are equivalent, meaning we can change any one of them to get the others through some math work. 

Imagine we want to graph $$y = m(x)$$, and it looks like a downward-opening parabola (a "U" shape that goes down). We know this because the term with $$x^2$$ has a negative number in front of it. 

When we talk about the $$y$$-intercept, we're asking where the graph crosses the $$y$$-axis. This happens when $$x = 0$$. So, we need to find $$m(0)$$.

Let's check the three forms:

1. In the first form, we substitute $$0$$ for $$x$$ and get $$-2 \times -3 \times -9$$. Some math is needed here.
2. In the second form, substituting $$0$$ for $$x$$ gives us $$-6^2 = 36$$. Then we multiply by $$-2$$ to get $$-72$$ and add $$18$$. This also needs some calculation.
3. In the third form (standard form), if we put $$x = 0$$, the terms with $$x$$ disappear, leaving $$m(0) = -54$$. This is the easiest.

So, the $$y$$-intercept is at $$(0, -54)$$. 

Be careful when looking at vertex form (the second form). It seems like you could just take $$18$$ as $$m(0)$$, but that's not right. Substituting $$0$$ for $$x$$ in the vertex form actually needs more work, and you get $$m(0) \ne 18$$.

Now, let's talk about the vertex (the highest or lowest point of the parabola). The form that makes it easiest to see the vertex is the vertex form. For our downward-opening parabola, the vertex is the maximum point. 

In the vertex form, $$x - 6^2$$ is always zero or positive. When multiplied by $$-2$$, it's zero or negative, meaning it reduces $$18$$. To find the vertex, we set $$x - 6 = 0$$, so $$x = 6$$. Then, $$m(6) = 18$$. So, the vertex is at $$(6, 18)$$.

For the other forms, finding the vertex is harder. Standard form needs techniques like completing the square, and the factored form would involve finding zeros first and then averaging them to find the vertex.

Lastly, let's explore finding the zeros or roots of the function (where the graph crosses the $$x$$-axis). This happens when the function equals zero.

The factored form is best for this because we can set each factor to zero. For example, if one form is $$(x + 1)(x + 11)$$, we solve $$(x + 1) = 0$$ and $$(x + 11) = 0$$, giving $$x = -1$$ and $$x = -11$$. 

If we used the other forms, they would require more algebra to get to the roots. 

So, when finding roots, the factored form is the quickest. 

I hope this makes things clear! Let me know if you have any more questions!
