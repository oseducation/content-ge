Hey there! Let's take a look at the linear equation $$y = \frac{1}{2}x - 3$$. If we wanted to draw the line showing all the points where the x and y values satisfy this equation, we could start by plotting a few points and then connecting them. Let's set up a little table with x and y values.

We'll pick x values that are easy to calculate for y. For example:

- When $$x = 0$$, $$y = \frac{1}{2} \times 0 - 3 = -3$$.
- When $$x = 2$$, $$y = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 - 3 = -2$$.
- When $$x = 4$$, $$y = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 - 3 = -1$$.

So we have the points (0, -3), (2, -2), and (4, -1). 

Now, let's plot these points:

- (0, -3)
- (2, -2)
- (4, -1)

We can draw a line through these points to represent the equation. 

An interesting thing to ask is: Where does this line intersect the axes (the x-axis and the y-axis)?

Let's find the x-intercept. This happens when $$y = 0$$. Setting $$y = 0$$ in the equation:

$$0 = \frac{1}{2}x - 3$$.

Solving for x:

$$\frac{1}{2}x = 3$$,
$$x = 6$$.

So, the x-intercept is at the point (6, 0). 

Now for the y-intercept. This happens when $$x = 0$$. We already know that when $$x = 0$$, $$y = -3$$. 

So, the y-intercept is at the point (0, -3).

We can also look at another linear equation, like $$5x + 6y = 30$$, and find its intercepts.

To find the y-intercept:

- When $$x = 0$$,
$$5 \times 0 + 6y = 30$$,
$$6y = 30$$,
$$y = 5$$.

So, the y-intercept is at (0, 5).

To find the x-intercept:

- When $$y = 0$$,
$$5x + 6 \times 0 = 30$$,
$$5x = 30$$,
$$x = 6$$.

So, the x-intercept is at (6, 0).

Now we can plot these points, (0, 5) and (6, 0), and draw a line through them. 

Remember, the x-intercept is where the line crosses the x-axis, and the y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis. For our first equation $$y = \frac{1}{2}x - 3$$, the intercepts are (6, 0) and (0, -3). For the second equation $$5x + 6y = 30$$, they are (6, 0) and (0, 5).

Great job! Letâ€™s keep practicing finding these intercepts for other equations!
