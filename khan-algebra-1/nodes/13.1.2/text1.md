- [Instructor] Let’s figure this out together! A rectangle is given with a height of 5 and a width of $$3x^2 - x + 2$$. We're asked to express the area of the entire rectangle, with the expression fully expanded.

Let's break this down step-by-step. The area of the whole rectangle is the height times the width. Here, the height is 5, and the width is $$3x^2 - x + 2$$. To find the area, we multiply these together:

$$\text{Area} = 5 \times (3x^2 - x + 2)$$.

Now, let's expand this by distributing the 5 across each term inside the parentheses.

First, we multiply 5 by $$3x^2$$:
$$5 \times 3x^2 = 15x^2$$.

Next, we multiply 5 by -x:
$$5 \times -x = -5x$$.

Finally, we multiply 5 by 2:
$$5 \times 2 = 10$$.

Putting it all together, the expanded area of the rectangle is:
$$15x^2 - 5x + 10$$.

Now, let’s do another example. We have a rectangle with a height of $$2x$$ and a width of $$3x + 4$$. Again, we want to express the area of the whole rectangle.

The formula for the area is the height times the width:
$$\text{Area} = 2x \times (3x + 4)$$.

We’ll expand this by distributing $$2x$$ across each term in the parentheses.

First, we multiply $$2x$$ by $$3x$$:
$$2x \times 3x = 6x^2$$.

Next, we multiply $$2x$$ by 4:
$$2x \times 4 = 8x$$.

So, the area of the whole rectangle is:
$$6x^2 + 8x$$.

I hope this makes sense! By breaking the problem into smaller steps, we can easily understand how to expand the expression for the area of a rectangle.
