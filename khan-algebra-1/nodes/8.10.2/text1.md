Hey there! Let's talk about Mr. Theisen and his amazing three-point shots on the basketball court. Imagine we have a graph showing the height of the ball as it travels horizontally. We can call the height of the ball $$ y(x) $$, meaning $$ y $$ changes depending on $$ x $$.

Now, let's break it down:

- $$ y $$ is the height of the ball.
- $$ x $$ is the distance the ball travels horizontally.

On the graph:
- The y-axis represents the height of the ball.
- The x-axis represents the horizontal distance.

Mr. Theisen is standing at $$ x = 0 $$. Here’s a rough stick figure of Mr. Theisen at the starting point. 

When $$ x = 0 $$, you see the ball's height on the y-axis. This initial height is where he releases the ball. It looks like this height is 6 feet. So, when Mr. Theisen lets go of the ball, it's 6 feet high.

As Mr. Theisen shoots, the ball follows a path that looks like a curve (a parabola). It rises to a peak height of about 16 feet and then starts to fall. Around 26 feet away, the ball hits something. Since this spot is 10 feet high, it must be the basketball goal he’s aiming for. So, the ball goes through the hoop and then drops straight down.

Now, let's check some statements about this situation:

1. **The ball is released from Mr. Theisen's hand at a height of 6 feet.**
   - Yes, that’s correct! At $$ x = 0 $$, the height is 6 feet, which is shown by the y-intercept on the graph.

2. **Mr. Theisen is shooting the basketball from 26 feet away.**
   - Not quite. He's at $$ x = 0 $$. The goal is 26 feet away, but this point shows where the ball starts dropping more steeply, not the y-intercept.

3. **The rim of the basketball hoop is 10 feet high.**
   - True, but this tells us the height of the goal, not the y-intercept.

4. **The maximum height that the ball reaches is 16 feet.**
   - Also true, but this is the peak of the curve, not the y-intercept.

So, based on our graph and these explanations, the correct statement is the first one: "The ball is released from Mr. Theisen's hand at a height of 6 feet." This shows the meaning of the y-intercept in our function $$ y(x) $$.

Hope this helps you understand how we analyze the graph and interpret the information. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
