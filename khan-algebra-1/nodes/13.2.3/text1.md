Sure! Let's work through this together.

We need to multiply $$(3x + 2)$$ by $$(5x - 7)$$. So, we're multiplying two binomials. I'll show you two ways to do this: one is a bit like a shortcut that you might learn in class, called FOIL, and the other is a more logical way using the distributive property.

First, let's look at the FOIL method.

FOIL stands for First, Outside, Inside, and Last. It helps you remember which terms to multiply together:

- **First**: Multiply the first terms in each binomial: $$(3x \cdot 5x)$$
- **Outside**: Multiply the outer terms: $$(3x \cdot -7)$$
- **Inside**: Multiply the inner terms: $$(2 \cdot 5x)$$
- **Last**: Multiply the last terms: $$(2 \cdot -7)$$

So, using FOIL method:
$$ (3x + 2)(5x - 7) = (3x \cdot 5x) + (3x \cdot -7) + (2 \cdot 5x) + (2 \cdot -7) $$

Let's multiply each pair of terms:
- $$3x \cdot 5x = 15x^2$$
- $$3x \cdot -7 = -21x$$
- $$2 \cdot 5x = 10x$$
- $$2 \cdot -7 = -14$$

Now combine these results:
$$ 15x^2 - 21x + 10x - 14 $$

You can simplify this even further by combining the like terms (the $$x$$ terms):
$$ 15x^2 - 11x - 14 $$

And there's our answer using the FOIL method!

Next, let's see how we can do this using the distributive property.

The distributive property means multiplying each term in one binomial by every term in the other binomial. Hereâ€™s how:

$$ (3x + 2)(5x - 7) $$

First, distribute $$3x$$ to $$5x - 7$$:
$$ 3x(5x - 7) = (3x \cdot 5x) + (3x \cdot -7) = 15x^2 - 21x $$

Next, distribute $$2$$ to $$5x - 7$$:
$$ 2(5x - 7) = (2 \cdot 5x) + (2 \cdot -7) = 10x - 14 $$

Now, sum these results:
$$ 15x^2 - 21x + 10x - 14 $$

Combine the like terms:
$$ 15x^2 - 11x - 14 $$

So, we get the same result either way!

Now you understand how to multiply binomials, both with the FOIL method and using the distributive property. The distributive property is a key concept that will help you even if you forget the FOIL method later in life.
