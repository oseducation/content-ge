Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step together. Here’s how I would explain it to you:

Marvin has a small pool in his backyard. The pool is shaped like a cylinder. The base of this pool covers an area of 4 square meters, and the pool's height is 60 centimeters. We need to figure out the pool's volume in cubic meters. 

First, let's picture what this pool looks like. It's a small, round pool where you can relax, but not swim a lot. Imagine a vertical cylinder with a round base and some height.

The base area is 4 square meters, which means the flat part at the bottom of the pool is 4 square meters. The height of the pool is given as 60 centimeters. Now, here's a key thing: we need to get the volume in cubic meters, but the given height is in centimeters. 

To find the volume of a cylinder, we use the formula: 

$$ \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} $$

At first glance, we might think to just multiply 4 by 60 directly to get the volume. But this would be a mistake because our units need to match. 

The height must be in meters, not centimeters. So we need to convert 60 centimeters to meters. We know that 100 centimeters make 1 meter. Thus, if we have 60 centimeters, that’s:

$$ \frac{60}{100} = 0.6 \text{ meters} $$

Now let's use this correct height in meters. So, our volume calculation would be:

$$ \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} = 4 \, \text{square meters} \times 0.6 \, \text{meters} $$

Now, let's multiply these together:

$$ 4 \times 0.6 = 2.4 \, \text{cubic meters} $$

So, the volume of Marvin's pool is 2.4 cubic meters.
