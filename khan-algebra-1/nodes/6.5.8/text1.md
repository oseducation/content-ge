Hey there! Let's work through this problem together. Imagine you are solving a system of two linear equations with two variables. You've found more than one solution that works for both equations. Let's figure out what that means.

First, let's draw our axes. The vertical axis can be one of the variables, and the horizontal axis can be the other variable. Let's call the vertical axis $$y$$ and the horizontal axis $$x$$.

When you graph each equation, each linear equation in two variables will be represented by a line. 

There are three main scenarios that can happen with these lines:

1. **The lines don't intersect at all**: This happens if the lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts (they are parallel). In this case, there are no solutions that satisfy both equations at the same time.

2. **The lines intersect at exactly one point**: This means there is one specific $$ (x, y) $$ point that works for both equations. However, this isn't our scenario either, because we are looking for more than one solution.

3. **The lines overlap completely**: This means both equations represent the same line. In this scenario, every point on the line is a solution, leading to an infinite number of solutions. 

Since you have found more than one solution, the third scenario must be true. The lines must overlap completely, meaning there are infinitely many solutions. 

So, the correct statement here is "there are infinitely many more solutions to the system."
