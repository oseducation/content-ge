Hey there! Let’s work out the product of $$(x - 4)$$ and $$(x + 7)$$, and write it in standard quadratic form. That just means getting it into the form $$ax^2 + bx + c$$. Ready to dive in?

First, let’s distribute $$(x - 4)$$ over $$(x + 7)$$. We can break it down like this:
$$$$(x - 4)(x) + (x - 4)(7)$$
Now distribute each part:
$$$$(x \cdot x) + (x \cdot -4) + (7 \cdot x) + (7 \cdot -4)$$
Simplify each multiplication:
$$$$(x^2) + (-4x) + (7x) + (-28)$$
Combine like terms:
$$$$(x^2) + (3x) + (-28)$$

So, the product is:
$$$$(x^2 + 3x - 28)$$

Notice, we used the distributive property twice here. A bit of a pattern to spot: when multiplying two binomials like this—with coefficients of 1 on $$x$$—here’s what happens:

1. The $$x^2$$ term comes from $$(x \cdot x)$$.
2. The constant term ($$c$$) is $$( -4 \cdot 7 = -28)$$.
3. The $$x$$ term ($$3x$$) comes from $$( -4 + 7)$$.

This pattern can help you multiply binomials faster once you see it a few times. But remember, it all comes from applying the distributive property.

Great job working through this with me! Keep practicing, and soon it’ll become second nature.
