Hey there! Let's work on graphing the function $$f(x) = 2 \cdot |x + 3| + 2$$ together. They’ve already given us the graph of $$y = |x|$$, so we’ll use that and make some changes step-by-step.

First, let’s look at the graph of $$y = |x + 3|$$. When you replace $$x$$ with $$x + 3$$, it means you're shifting the graph to the left by 3 units. Think of it like this: if you have $$y = |x - (-3)|$$, you’re moving everything 3 steps to the left. So let’s shift the $$|x|$$ graph to the left by 3 units.

Next, we want to graph $$y = 2 \cdot |x + 3|$$. This means we’re going to stretch the graph vertically by a factor of 2. So, instead of the lines going up and down with slopes of 1 and -1, they’ll now go up and down with slopes of 2 and -2.

Finally, we want to graph $$y = 2 \cdot |x + 3| + 2$$. Here, we simply move our graph up by 2 units. Every point on our already stretched graph will move up 2 steps.

So to sum it up:
1. Shift the graph of $$y = |x|$$ to the left by 3 units to get $$y = |x + 3|$$.
2. Stretch this graph vertically by 2 to get $$y = 2 \cdot |x + 3|$$.
3. Move this entire graph up by 2 units to get our final function $$f(x) = 2 \cdot |x + 3|+ 2$$.

And there you go! This step-by-step method makes the transformations clear and easy to understand. You could also perform these transformations in a different order, but they would still lead you to the same final graph of $$f(x)$$. Happy graphing!
