Hey there! Let's talk about finding the slope of a line on a graph. The slope tells us how steep the line is. It's calculated as the change in $$y$$ divided by the change in $$x$$. This will always be the same for a straight line. Sometimes you might see a little triangle symbol, which is a capital delta, meaning "change in." So, $$\Delta y$$ means the change in $$y$$ and $$\Delta x$$ means the change in $$x$$.

Let's dive in and figure out the change in $$y$$ and the change in $$x$$ by choosing some points from the graph.

1. Pick a starting point: Let's start at a point that's easy to read, like (−3,−3).
2. Pick another point: Move to another easy-to-read point, like (0,−1).

Now, let's see the changes:
- Change in $$x$$: We go from $$x = -3$$ to $$x = 0$$. That's a change of $$3$$ steps (since $$0 - (-3) = 3$$).
- Change in $$y$$: We go from $$y = -3$$ to $$y = -1$$. That's a change of $$2$$ steps (since $$-1 - (-3) = 2$$).

So, the slope $$m$$ is:
$$
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{3}.
$$

We can pick any two points and get the same result. Let's try different points to see:

1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move to (−5,−3).

Now, let's see the changes:
- Change in $$y$$: We go from $$y = 1$$ to $$y = -3$$. That's a change of $$-4$$ steps (since $$-3 - 1 = -4$$).
- Change in $$x$$: We go from $$x = 1$$ to $$x = -5$$. That's a change of $$-6$$ steps (since $$-5 - 1 = -6$$).

So, the slope $$m$$ is:
$$
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-4}{-6} = \frac{2}{3}.
$$

The negatives cancel out, and we still get $$\frac{2}{3}$$.

No matter which points you choose, as long as you calculate the changes correctly, the slope will always be the same. Hope that helps!
