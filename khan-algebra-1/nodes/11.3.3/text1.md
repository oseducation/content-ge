Sure, let's go through this together in a fun and easy way, step-by-step!

Hey there! Let's practice making radical expressions with variables simpler. 

Imagine we have: 
$$2 \times \sqrt{7x} \times 3 \times \sqrt{14x^2}$$

First, we can change the order of things to make it easier:
$$2 \times 3 \times \sqrt{7x} \times \sqrt{14x^2}$$

This means:
$$6 \times \sqrt{7x \times 14x^2}$$

Next, letâ€™s break down the radicand (the number inside the square root). We can factor 14 as $$2 \times 7$$, so we change what's inside the square root to:
$$6 \times \sqrt{7x \times (2 \times 7 \times x^2)}$$

This will look like:
$$6 \times \sqrt{(7 \times 7) \times (x \times x^2) \times 2}$$

To simplify further, notice:
- $$7 \times 7 = 49$$ (which is a perfect square)
- $$x \times x^2 = x^3$$

So we rewrite it as:
$$6 \times \sqrt{49x^2 \times 2x}$$

Breaking it into simpler parts gives us:
$$6 \times \sqrt{49x^2} \times \sqrt{2x}$$

Since the square root of $$49$$ is $$7$$, and the square root of $$x^2$$ is $$x$$, we get:
$$6 \times 7x \times \sqrt{2x} = 42x \times \sqrt{2x}$$

Thatâ€™s our simplified expression!

Letâ€™s try another one:

$$\sqrt{2a} \times \sqrt{14a^3} \times \sqrt{5a}$$

First, multiply the numbers inside the square roots:
$$\sqrt{2 \times 14 \times 5} \times \sqrt{a \times a^3 \times a}$$

Factoring it gives us:
$$2 \times (2 \times 7) \times 5 \times a^5$$

Simplifying further:
$$\sqrt{4 \times 35a^5}$$

We break it into parts:
$$\sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{a^4} \times \sqrt{35a}$$

Since:
- Square root of $$4$$ is $$2$$
- Square root of $$a^4$$ is $$a^2$$

We get:
$$2a^2 \times \sqrt{35a}$$

Now letâ€™s handle a trickier one with two variables:
$$\sqrt{72x^3z^3}$$

We look for factors inside the square root:
- 72 isnâ€™t a perfect square, but $$72 = 36 \times 2$$ (and 36 is a perfect square)
- $$x^3 = x^2 \times x$$
- $$z^3 = z^2 \times z$$

So, rewrite the radicand:
$$\sqrt{36x^2z^2 \times 2xz}$$

Breaking it apart gives us:
$$\sqrt{36x^2z^2} \times \sqrt{2xz}$$

Since:
- Square root of $$36$$ is $$6$$
- Square root of $$x^2$$ is $$x$$
- Square root of $$z^2$$ is $$z$$

We get:
$$6xz \times \sqrt{2xz}$$

And thatâ€™s the simplest form!

Isnâ€™t that cool? We can break things down step-by-step to make it much easier. If you have any questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
