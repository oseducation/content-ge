Hey there! So let's say you have a car, and this car travels 150 kilometers in 3 hours. We're trying to figure out the rate at which the car traveled. Take a moment to think about it yourself. How can we express this rate? What units would make sense?

First off, let's remind ourselves what rate is. You can think of it as:
$$\text{distance} = \text{rate} \times \text{time}$$

Or, if you divide both sides by time:
$$\text{rate} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$$

Theyâ€™ve given us the distance (150 kilometers) and the time (3 hours). We just need to divide the distance by the time to find the rate:
$$\text{rate} = \frac{150 \, \text{km}}{3 \, \text{hrs}}$$

Now, let's do the math:
$$150 \div 3 = 50$$

So, the rate is 50 kilometers per hour.

$$50 \, \text{km/hr}$$

You can imagine that in 1 hour, the car will go 50 kilometers.

Now let's think of other ways to express this. What if we wanted to express it in terms of kilometers per second? First, note that there are 3600 seconds in an hour. Since a second is a much shorter time, the distance covered in a second will be much less.

$$50 \, \text{km/hr} \rightarrow \text{km/sec}$$

To convert, we multiply by the factor to change hours to seconds:
$$1 \, \text{hour} = 3600 \, \text{seconds}$$

So, let's use this conversion:
$$\frac{50 \, \text{km}}{1 \, \text{hr}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{hr}}{3600 \, \text{sec}} = \frac{50 \, \text{km}}{3600 \, \text{sec}}$$

Simplifying:
$$\frac{50}{3600} = \frac{5}{360} = \frac{1}{72} \, \text{km/sec}$$

This means the car travels $\frac{1}{72}$ of a kilometer every second. This can be hard to imagine, so it might not be a very useful unit.

What about meters per second? Since 1 kilometer is 1000 meters:
$$\frac{1}{72} \, \text{km/sec} = \frac{1 \cdot 1000}{72} \, \text{meters/sec} = \frac{1000}{72} \, \text{meters/sec}$$

Simplifying further:
$$\frac{1000}{72} \approx 13.9 \, \text{meters/sec}$$

This is easier to visualize: the car goes about 13.9 meters every second.

So, we have found:
- 50 kilometers per hour is reasonable.
- 13.9 meters per second is also reasonable.

But saying $\frac{1}{72}$ of a kilometer per second or 50,000 meters per hour might be less helpful to imagine.

In summary, the best ways to express the car's speed are:
- 50 km/hr
- 13.9 meters/sec
