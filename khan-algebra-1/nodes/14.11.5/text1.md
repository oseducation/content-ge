Hi there! Let's chat about a cool problem where Rodrigo is watching a helicopter. The height of the helicopter above the ground (in meters) $$t$$ minutes after takeoff is given by a function. Rodrigo wants to know when the helicopter will land. Let's work together to figure this out!

First, picture what's happening. We have a graph to look at. The horizontal axis is $$t$$, which is time in minutes, and the vertical axis is height, measured in meters above the ground. Because the function has a negative coefficient for the quadratic term, the graph is a downward-opening parabola, like a frown.

The helicopter starts from a platform, goes up, reaches a high point (the vertex), and comes back down. We need to find out when it hits the ground, which is when the height equals zero.

So, we need to solve our quadratic function to find out when this happens. Our function looks like this:

$$
-3t^2 + 24t + 60
$$

We want to find when this height is zero:

$$
-3t^2 + 24t + 60 = 0
$$

To make it simpler, let's divide everything by -3:

$$
t^2 - 8t - 20 = 0
$$

Next, we look for two numbers that multiply to -20 and add up to -8. Those numbers are -10 and 2. So, we can write the equation as:

$$
(t - 10)(t + 2) = 0
$$

For this product to be zero, one of these factors must be zero:

$$
t - 10 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad t + 2 = 0
$$

Solving these equations, we get:

$$
t = 10 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -2
$$

Since time can't be negative, we only consider $$t = 10$$. This means the helicopter lands 10 minutes after takeoff.

So, after taking off from 60 meters high, the helicopter goes up, then down, and finally lands on the ground 10 minutes later.
