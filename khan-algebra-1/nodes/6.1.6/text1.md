Sure thing! Let's break it down in simple words:

So, Lauren mixes dark and light roast beans to make coffee at her cafe. She needs to get a total of 80 kilograms of beans. The dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, and the light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram. She wants to spend exactly $220 in total. 

We are given a graph that shows a system of equations for this situation. Here, $$x$$ represents the kilograms of dark roast beans, and $$y$$ represents the kilograms of light roast beans.

Let's look at what the graph tells us:

1. The blue line shows that the total amount of beans (dark and light) must be 80 kilograms. This is represented by the equation $$x + y = 80$$.

2. The green line shows that the total cost must be $220. This is represented by the equation $$3x + 2y = 220$$. 

The graph also has points labeled C, D, F, and E. Let's see what each point means:

- **Point C:** 
  - This point is on the green line but above the blue line.
  - This means that the total cost is $220, but the total amount of beans is more than 80 kilograms.
  - According to the graph, she is using about 10 kilograms of dark roast and 95 kilograms of light roast. Added together, that's 105 kilograms, which is more than 80.

- **Point D:**
  - This point is on the blue line but below the green line.
  - This means that the total amount of beans is 80 kilograms, but the total cost is less than $220.
  - For example, if she uses 20 kilograms of dark roast and 60 kilograms of light roast, the cost would be $180 (since $$3 \times 20 + 2 \times 60 = 60 + 120 = 180$$).

- **Point F:**
  - This point is below both the blue and green lines.
  - This means that neither the total beans are 80 kilograms nor the total cost is $220. 
  - For instance, if she uses 30 kilograms of each type, the total beans are 60 kilograms and the total cost is $150 (since $$3 \times 30 + 2 \times 30 = 90 + 60 = 150$$).

- **Point E:**
  - This point is on both lines.
  - This means that the total amount of beans is 80 kilograms, and the total cost is $220.
  - This is the perfect combination she needs to meet both requirements.

So, if Lauren wants to find the right mix of beans that fits both the total weight and total cost, she should look at point E on the graph.
