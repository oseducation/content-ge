Sure! Let's work through the problem together to solve for $$y$$. We have two conditions: 

1. $$3y + 7 < 2y$$
2. $$4y + 8 > -48$$

We need to find all the $$y$$ values that satisfy both conditions. Let's solve each condition step by step.

### First Condition: $$3y + 7 < 2y$$

1. Subtract $$2y$$ from both sides to get the $$y$$ terms on one side:
   $$3y + 7 - 2y < 2y - 2y$$
   Simplifies to:
   $$y + 7 < 0$$
2. Subtract $$7$$ from both sides to isolate $$y$$:
   $$y + 7 - 7 < 0 - 7$$
   Simplifies to:
   $$y < -7$$

### Second Condition: $$4y + 8 > -48$$

1. Subtract $$8$$ from both sides:
   $$4y + 8 - 8 > -48 - 8$$
   Simplifies to:
   $$4y > -56$$
2. Divide both sides by $$4$$:
   $$\frac{4y}{4} > \frac{-56}{4}$$
   Simplifies to:
   $$y > -14$$

Now we have two inequalities:
$$y < -7$$ and $$y > -14$$

### Combining the Conditions

We need $$y$$ to be between $$-14$$ and $$-7$$:
$$-14 < y < -7$$

### Visualizing on a Number Line

Let's draw a number line and mark these points.

```
... -15 -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 ...
         (-------------------)
```
Where:
- Open circle at $$-14$$ (because $$y > -14$$)
- Open circle at $$-7$$ (because $$y < -7$$)
- The solution is all the $$y$$ values between $$-14$$ and $$-7$$.

### Testing Values

To be sure, let's check a value within the range, like $$y = -10$$:

For the first condition:
$$3(-10) + 7 < 2(-10)$$
$$-30 + 7 < -20$$
$$-23 < -20$$ (True)

For the second condition:
$$4(-10) + 8 > -48$$
$$-40 + 8 > -48$$
$$-32 > -48$$ (True)

So, $$y = -10$$ works.

Let's try a value outside, like $$0$$:
For the first condition:
$$3(0) + 7 < 2(0)$$
$$7 < 0$$ (False)

For the second condition:
$$4(0) + 8 > -48$$
$$8 > -48$$ (True)

Since $$0$$ does not satisfy the first condition, it does not work.

Thus, the solution is:
$$-14 < y < -7$$
