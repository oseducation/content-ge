Hey there! Let's learn how to graph the solution set for a system of inequalities. This system has two inequalities: $$y > x - 8$$ and $$y < 5 - x$$. We'll graph each inequality separately, and then find the area where they overlap, which will be our solution set.

First, we need to draw our coordinate axes. The horizontal line is the x-axis, and the vertical line is the y-axis.

### Inequality 1: $$y > x - 8$$

1. **Boundary Line**: The boundary line for this inequality is $$y = x - 8$$.
2. **Finding Points**:
   - When $$x = 0$$, $$y = -8$$. So one point is $$(0, -8)$$.
   - The slope of the line is 1, which means for every step to the right, we go up one step. If $$y = 0$$, then $$x = 8$$. So another point is $$(8, 0)$$.
3. **Drawing the Line**: Draw a dotted line through these points since we do not include the line itself ($$>$$ means greater than, but not equal to).
4. **Shading**: Shade everything above this dotted line because $$y$$ values are greater than the line.

### Inequality 2: $$y < 5 - x$$

1. **Boundary Line**: The boundary line for this inequality is $$y = 5 - x$$.
2. **Finding Points**:
   - When $$x = 0$$, $$y = 5$$. So one point is $$(0, 5)$$.
   - The slope of the line is -1, which means for every step to the right, we go down one step. If $$y = 0$$, then $$x = 5$$. So another point is $$(5, 0)$$.
3. **Drawing the Line**: Draw a dotted line through these points since we do not include the line itself ($$<$$ means less than, but not equal to).
4. **Shading**: Shade everything below this dotted line because $$y$$ values are less than the line.

### Where They Overlap

The solution set is where the shaded areas of both inequalities overlap. This region will be above the line $$y = x - 8$$ and below the line $$y = 5 - x$$. 

So, the final area where both conditions are true is our solution. It will be the region between these two lines but not including the lines themselves.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
