Sure! Let's chat about this problem in simpler terms.

Kaya rode her bike towards a tree at a constant speed. The table below shows how far she is from the tree based on how many times her front tire has turned. For example, after 4 turns, she is 22.5 meters from the tree. After 8 turns, she's 12.5 meters away. And after 12 turns, she's just 2.5 meters from the tree. So, she gets closer to the tree with more tire turns. 

We have some questions to answer:

1. How far away was the tree when she started?
2. How far does she travel with each tire turn?
3. How many tire turns to get all the way to the tree?

First, let's figure out how far the tree was at the start. 

After 4 turns, she's 22.5 meters away. She gets 10 meters closer after every 4 turns. To find the starting distance (at 0 turns), we need to go back 4 turns, which means adding those 10 meters back. So:

$$22.5 + 10 = 32.5 \text{ meters}$$

So, the tree was 32.5 meters away when she started.

Next, let's see how far Kaya travels with each tire turn. If 4 turns get her 10 meters closer, then each turn gets her:

$$ \frac{10 \text{ meters}}{4 \text{ turns}} = 2.5 \text{ meters per turn} $$

Lastly, let's find out how many turns she needs to reach the tree. After 12 turns, she's 2.5 meters from the tree. Since each turn covers 2.5 meters, she just needs one more turn:

$$12 + 1 = 13 \text{ turns}$$

So, it took 13 turns for her to reach the tree.

To think about it another way, if we put the number of turns (rotations) on the x-axis and the distance to the tree on the y-axis, it forms a line. At 0 turns, she's 32.5 meters away (this is the y-intercept). The slope of the line (how steep it is) shows the rate of change, which is:

$$ \text{slope} = \frac{\text{Change in distance}}{\text{Change in rotations}} = \frac{-10 \text{ meters}}{4 \text{ rotations}} = -2.5 $$

This means every turn brings her 2.5 meters closer (a negative change in distance). When rotations are 13, the distance is 0 (this is the x-intercept).
