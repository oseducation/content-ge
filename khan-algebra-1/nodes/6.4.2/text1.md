Hi there! Let's break this down and keep it simple, so you can easily follow along. 

Vivek and Camila's teacher gave them a system of linear equations to solve. Both of them did some steps and got their own systems. We need to figure out if their systems are equivalent to the teacher's original system.

First, let's understand what it means for systems to be equivalent. For our purpose, two systems are equivalent if they have the same solution. So, if an $$ (x, y) $$ pair solves the teacher's system, it should also solve Vivek's and Camila's systems to be considered equivalent.

Let's start with Vivek's system:

- Vivek's first equation is exactly the same as the teacher's first equation. So, any solution to the teacher's system will definitely satisfy that equation.
- His second equation, though, is different from the teacher's. We can see that the second equation isn't just a multiple of the original one (since you can't multiply the teacher's second equation by a number to get Vivek's second equation).

How did Vivek get to his new second equation? It looks like he combined the two original equations:
- From $$ -4x + 5y = 1 $$ to $$ -3x + 7y = 0 $$, he must have added $$ x + 2y $$ to the left side. 
- And, since he added $$ x + 2y = -1 $$ on the right side too, his step is legitimate. This means he's forming a new equation that still works with the original system's solution.

Next, let's look at Camila's system:

- Camila's first equation is the same as the teacher's second equation.
- Her second equation looks like a multiplied version of the teacher's first equation by $$ -8 $$:
  $$ -8 \times x = -8x $$
  $$ -8 \times 2y = -16y $$
  $$ -8 \times (-1) = 8 $$

This means she only changed the look of the equation but not its essence. Multiplying both sides by a number doesnâ€™t change the solution.

Both Vivek and Camila used correct steps to alter the equations without changing the solution set of the original system. Vivek added equations, and Camila multiplied them by a constant. So, both of their systems are equivalent to the teacher's system.

I hope that makes it clearer! If you have any questions or need further explanation, feel free to ask!
