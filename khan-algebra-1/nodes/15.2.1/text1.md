Sure, I'd love to help you understand this! Let's break it down together.

First, let's think about whether the product or sum of rational numbers are always going to be rational. 

### Product of Rational Numbers

A rational number can be written as a ratio of two integers. For example, one rational number can be $$\frac{a}{b}$$ and we want to multiply it by another rational number, $$\frac{m}{n}$$.

When we multiply these two rational numbers, we get:

$$ \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{m}{n} = \frac{a \times m}{b \times n} $$

Here, $$a$$ and $$m$$ are integers, so $$a \times m$$ is an integer. Also, $$b$$ and $$n$$ are integers, so $$b \times n$$ is an integer. So, $$\frac{a \times m}{b \times n}$$ is a ratio of two integers, meaning it is a rational number. 

Hence, the product of two rational numbers is also a rational number.

### Sum of Rational Numbers

Now, let's see what happens with the sum of two rational numbers. Let's say the first rational number is $$\frac{a}{b}$$ and the second one is $$\frac{m}{n}$$.

To add these, we need a common denominator, which can be $$b \times n$$. We can rewrite the fractions like this:

$$ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{a \times n}{b \times n} $$ and $$ \frac{m}{n} = \frac{m \times b}{n \times b} $$ 

So, the sum is:

$$ \frac{a \times n}{b \times n} + \frac{m \times b}{n \times b} = \frac{a \times n + m \times b}{b \times n} $$

Here, we have $$a \times n$$ and $$m \times b$$, both of which are integers. The sum of these two integers $$a \times n + m \times b$$ is also an integer. And, $$b \times n$$ is an integer (since both $$b$$ and $$n$$ are integers).

So, the sum $$ \frac{a \times n + m \times b}{b \times n} $$ is a ratio of two integers, meaning it is a rational number.

Therefore, both the product and the sum of any two rational numbers will always give us another rational number.
