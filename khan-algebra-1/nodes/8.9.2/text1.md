Sure, let's break it down together and make it simpler:

There's a function, $$f(x)$$, that is shown on a graph below. We need to find a part of the graph where $$f(x)$$ is less than 0. 

Here's what that means:
- $$f(x)$$ is shown up and down on the graph (vertical axis).
- $$x$$ is shown left and right on the graph (horizontal axis).
- When $$f(x)$$ is less than 0, it means the graph is below the $$x$$-axis.

So, we need to find the places where the graph is below the $$x$$-axis. I see two parts where the graph is below the $$x$$-axis. We can pick either part and show it. 

Let's do it again with another question:

We need to find a part of the graph where $$f(x)$$ is greater than 0. 

This means:
- We are looking for where the graph is above the $$x$$-axis.

I see two parts where the graph is above the $$x$$-axis. We can pick either part and highlight it.

One more time:

Find a part where $$f(x)$$ is greater than 0.

Again, we are looking for where the graph is above the $$x$$-axis. There are two parts again where the graph is above the $$x$$-axis. Let's pick one and highlight it.

And there we go! We've got it!
