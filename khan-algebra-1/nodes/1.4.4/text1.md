Alright! Let's practice simplifying some math expressions with numbers that might look a bit more difficult. Don't worry, let's work through it together. Feel free to pause if you want to give it a try on your own first!

We have:
$$ -5.55 - 8.55c + 4.35c $$

First, let's combine the terms with $$ c $$ in them. We have $$ -8.55c $$ and $$ 4.35c $$.

We add $$ -8.55 $$ and $$ 4.35 $$, which means we only add the numbers in front of $$ c $$. So:
$$ -8.55 + 4.35 = -4.2 $$

Now, our expression looks like this:
$$ -5.55 - 4.2c $$

We can't simplify this any further because one part has $$ c $$ and the other does not. So, we're done with this one!

Let's look at another example with fractions:
$$ \frac{2}{5}m - \frac{4}{5} - \frac{3}{5}m $$

First, combine the $$ m $$ terms:
$$ \frac{2}{5}m - \frac{3}{5}m $$

This becomes:
$$ \left( \frac{2}{5} - \frac{3}{5} \right)m = -\frac{1}{5}m $$

So now we have:
$$ -\frac{1}{5}m - \frac{4}{5} $$

Again, we can't combine these terms any further, so this is as simple as it gets!

Let's try one more, this time with parentheses:
$$ 2 \left( \frac{1}{5}m - \frac{2}{5} \right) + \frac{3}{5} $$

First, let's get rid of the parentheses by distributing the $$ 2 $$:
$$ 2 \times \frac{1}{5}m = \frac{2}{5}m $$
$$ 2 \times -\frac{2}{5} = -\frac{4}{5} $$

So now our expression looks like:
$$ \frac{2}{5}m - \frac{4}{5} + \frac{3}{5} $$

Let's combine the fractions:
$$ -\frac{4}{5} + \frac{3}{5} = -\frac{1}{5} $$

Now we have:
$$ \frac{2}{5}m - \frac{1}{5} $$

And we're all done! Can't simplify that anymore.

Great job! We practiced combining terms, working with fractions, and distributing numbers. Keep practicing, and it'll get easier every time!
