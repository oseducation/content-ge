**Practice Examples on Slope and Y-Intercept**

1. **Finding the Slope:**
   
   Given: $$y = -4x - 3$$
   
   - This is in *slope-intercept form*, which is written as $$y = mx + b$$.
   - Here, $$m$$ is the slope.
   - We need to find the *coefficient* of $$x$$, which is -4.
   
   So, the *slope* $$m$$ is -4.

2. **Finding the Y-Intercept:**

   Given: $$y = -3x - 2$$
   
   - This equation is also in slope-intercept form $$y = mx + b$$.
   - Here, $$b$$ is the y-intercept, which is -2.
   
   The *y-intercept* is the point where the line meets the y-axis. If $$x = 0$$, then $$y = b$$, so $$y = -2$$. 

   Therefore, the y-intercept is at the point $$(0, -2)$$.

3. **Completing the Equation:**

   Information: The *slope*, $$m$$, is 5 and the *y-intercept*, $$b$$, is 4.

   - The general form is $$y = mx + b$$.
   - Given: $$m = 5$$ and $$b = 4$$.
   
   Putting it all in:
   $$y = 5x + 4$$

   So, thatâ€™s the equation of the line with a slope of 5 and y-intercept at $$(0, 4)$$.

Remember, for these types of problems, just identify the slope and the y-intercept from the equation or given information, and plug them into the slope-intercept form $$y = mx + b$$.
