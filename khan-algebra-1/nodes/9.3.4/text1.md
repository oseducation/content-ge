Hi there!

Weâ€™re going to look at a geometric sequence with the first term $a_1$ equal to $$-\frac{1}{8}$$. Each term after that is twice the term before it. So, $$a_i = 2 \times a_{i-1}$$. Let's figure out what the fourth term, $$a_4$$, is. 

First off, you can pause here if you want to try it yourself.

Alright, letâ€™s work through it together. One way is to use the given formulas directly.

1. We know $$a_4 = 2 \times a_3$$.
2. Next, $$a_3 = 2 \times a_2$$.
3. And then, $$a_2 = 2 \times a_1$$.

Since we know $$a_1 = -\frac{1}{8}$$, we can find the next terms step-by-step:

- $$a_2 = 2 \times -\frac{1}{8} = -\frac{1}{4}$$
- $$a_3 = 2 \times -\frac{1}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}$$
- $$a_4 = 2 \times -\frac{1}{2} = -1$$

So, $$a_4 = -1$$.

Another way to tackle this is to use the fact that we have a common ratio of 2. Knowing this, we can write a formula for any term in the sequence:
$$a_i = a_1 \times 2^{(i-1)}$$.

Letâ€™s use that formula:

- For $$a_4$$, we get:
  $$a_4 = -\frac{1}{8} \times 2^{(4-1)}$$
  $$a_4 = -\frac{1}{8} \times 2^3$$
  $$a_4 = -\frac{1}{8} \times 8$$
  $$a_4 = -1$$

So either way, we find that $$a_4 = -1$$.

This second method is super helpful, especially if you have to find something like the 40th term, because repeating the steps for 40 terms would be really time-consuming.

Hope this helps! If you have any questions, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
