Here is a warm and friendly lesson about Rene Descartes, simplified for you!

## Meet Rene Descartes

Here is a **picture of Rene Descartes**. He was one of **the great minds** in both **math** and **philosophy**. There's a trend that many great philosophers were also great mathematicians and vice versa.

- **Contemporary of Galileo**: Descartes was 32 years younger but **died shortly after** Galileo, at the age of **54**, unlike Galileo who lived **into his 70s**.
- **Famous Quote**: Descartes is well-known for saying:
  - *"I think, therefore I am."*
- **Inspiring Quote**: One of his less famous but very practical quotes is:
  - *"You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing."*

### His Contribution to Algebra and Geometry

Descartes is **most responsible** for connecting **algebra** and **geometry**. 

### Algebra: 

Algebra involves **equations with symbols**. For example:
\[
y = 2x - 1
\]
You can pick values for **x** to see what **y** will be. Let's fill a table with a few values:
- If \( x = -2 \), then \( y = 2(-2) - 1 = -5 \).
- If \( x = -1 \), then \( y = 2(-1) - 1 = -3 \).
- If \( x = 0 \), then \( y = 2(0) - 1 = -1 \).
- If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 2(1) - 1 = 1 \).
- If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 2(2) - 1 = 3 \).

### Geometry:

Before Descartes, geometry was mainly about shapes, sizes, and angles, like in **Euclidean geometry** (studying triangles, circles, etc.).

### Descartes' Idea:

He thought **abstract algebra** could be **visualized**. Here's how:

1. **Two-Dimensional Plane**: Think of a piece of paper as a plane with:
   - **Up/Down** direction (y-axis)
   - **Left/Right** direction (x-axis)

2. **Plot Points**: Using the values we calculated:
   - Negative x and y values move left and down, respectively.
   - Positive x and y values move right and up.

### Cartesian Coordinate System:

Named after Descartes, this system helps us plot points on a plane using coordinates \((x, y)\):
- **Negative 2, Negative 5**: Plot this at \((-2, -5)\)
- **Negative 1, Negative 3**: Plot this at \((-1, -3)\)
- **Zero, Negative 1**: Plot this at \((0, -1)\)
- **One, One**: Plot this at \((1, 1)\)
- **Two, Three**: Plot this at \((2, 3)\)

### Connecting Algebra and Geometry

When you plot these points, they form a **line**. Any point on this line is a solution to the equation \( y = 2x - 1 \).

- For example, point \((1.5, 2)\) fits in the equation because \( 2 \times 1.5 - 1 = 2 \).

### Cartesian Coordinates

Thanks to Descartes:
- We can **visualize algebraic equations**.
- **Linear Equations**: They form **lines** when plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system.

In future lessons, we will explore various types of equations, some forming curves or other interesting shapes.
