**Lecture: Rene Descartes and Algebra Meets Geometry**

Here we have a picture of **Rene Descartes**, a great mind in both math and philosophy. You might notice a pattern that many great philosophers were also great mathematicians, and Descartes is a fine example of this. He was a contemporary of **Galileo**, being 32 years younger, but Descartes died younger, at the age of 54, compared to Galileo who lived into his 70s.

**Descartes** is well known for his famous quote: "I think, therefore I am." However, there's another lesser-known quote that I find very inspiring: "You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing." This reminds us that even the greatest minds made mistakes and kept going, which is great life advice.

Descartes did many things in math and philosophy, but he is most famous for connecting **algebra** and **geometry**. 

### Understanding Algebra and Geometry Connection

Consider the algebraic equation:   
\[ y = 2x - 1 \]

This equation links two variables, \( x \) and \( y \). By choosing values for \( x \), we can calculate corresponding values for \( y \):

- For \( x = -2 \):  
  \[ y = 2 \times -2 - 1 = -5 \]

- For \( x = -1 \):  
  \[ y = 2 \times -1 - 1 = -3 \]

- For \( x = 0 \):  
  \[ y = 2 \times 0 - 1 = -1 \]

- For \( x = 1 \):  
  \[ y = 2 \times 1 - 1 = 1 \]

- For \( x = 2 \):  
  \[ y = 2 \times 2 - 1 = 3 \]

So we have these pairs of points: (-2, -5), (-1, -3), (0, -1), (1, 1), and (2, 3).

### Visualizing Algebra on a Plane

What Descartes realized is that we can **visualize** these points on a two-dimensional plane:

1. **Draw Axes**: Draw a horizontal line (x-axis) and a vertical line (y-axis) that intersect at 0.

2. **Plot Points**: Mark the points on the plane based on their \( x \) and \( y \) values:
   - (-2, -5)
   - (-1, -3)
   - (0, -1)
   - (1, 1)
   - (2, 3)

By plotting these points, we can see a line forming. This line represents all the solutions to the equation \( y = 2x - 1 \).

### Cartesian Coordinates

Descartes introduced this way of visualizing algebraic equations by plotting points on a plane, which we now call **Cartesian coordinates** in his honor. 

These coordinates use the following conventions:
- **X-axis**: The left-right direction (horizontal)
- **Y-axis**: The up-down direction (vertical)
- Points are represented as (x, y).

### Linear Equations

The equation \( y = 2x - 1 \) is a **linear equation** because it forms a straight line on the coordinate plane. Any point on this line is a solution to the equation. This wasn't obvious until Descartes connected algebra and geometry.

This idea allows us to visualize relationships between variables and provides a powerful tool for understanding mathematical concepts. In the future, we'll explore other types of equations that form different shapes, not just lines.

### Conclusion

Rene Descartes' work in connecting algebra to geometry fundamentally changed how we understand and visualize mathematical relationships. Cartesian coordinates allow us to see these connections clearly, making algebra more accessible and practical.

So remember, the next time you plot points or graph equations, you're using ideas from one of the great minds in math and philosophy, Rene Descartes!
