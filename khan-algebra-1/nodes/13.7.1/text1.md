Hey there! Let's dive into a cool way to factor something called a "difference of squares." This just means we’re dealing with an expression like $$x^2 - 9$$. The reason it's called a "difference of squares" is that we're subtracting (that’s the "difference" part) two things that are squares. So, $$x^2$$ is a square and $$9$$ is also a square because it can be written as $$3^2$$.

So, in this example, we have $$x^2 - 3^2$$. It turns out this is quite easy to factor. But before we jump into that, let’s quickly review how we multiply binomials (that’s just a fancy name for expressions like $$(x + a)$$ and $$(x - a)$$).

So, imagine we want to multiply $$(x + a)$$ and $$(x - a)$$, where "a" can be any number. You can use a method called FOIL, which stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, or just think of it as using the distributive property twice.

Let’s break it down:
- First, multiply $$x$$ by $$x$$ to get $$x^2$$.
- Then multiply $$x$$ by $$-a$$ to get $$-ax$$.
- Multiply $$a$$ by $$x$$ to get $$+ax$$.
- And multiply $$a$$ by $$-a$$ to get $$-a^2$$.

When you add these up: $$x^2 - ax + ax - a^2$$, the $$+ax$$ and $$-ax$$ cancel each other out. So, you’re left with $$x^2 - a^2$$. This is the difference of squares! 

So, here’s a neat formula: $$x^2 - a^2 = (x + a)(x - a)$$.

Now, let’s use this to factor $$x^2 - 9$$:
- We know that $$9$$ is $$3^2$$, so $$a$$ is $$3$$.
- This means $$x^2 - 3^2 = (x + 3)(x - 3)$$.

Let’s try more examples to get the hang of it:
- For $$y^2 - 25$$:
  - Recognize that $$25$$ is $$5^2$$.
  - So, it factors to $$(y + 5)(y - 5)$$.

Another example:
- For $$121 - b^2$$:
  - Know that $$121$$ is $$11^2$$.
  - Hence, it factors to $$(11 + b)(11 - b)$$.

In general, if you see something like $$a^2 - b^2$$, you can factor it into $$(a + b)(a - b)$$.

A common mistake you might make is thinking $$y^2 - 25$$ factors to $$(y^2 + 25)(y^2 - 25)$$. This is not correct. What you need to find are the square roots: $$y$$ and $$5$$, making it $$(y + 5)(y - 5)$$.

Practice makes perfect, so give it a try. There are lots of exercises on Khan Academy to help you get comfortable with factoring differences of squares. Keep practicing, and you’ll get the hang of it in no time!
