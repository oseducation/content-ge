Hey there! Let's have a look at this graph $$y = f(x)$$ and think about when the function is positive or negative and when it's increasing or decreasing.

First, let's figure out when the function is positive. When a function is positive, it means its value is greater than zero — this means the graph is above the x-axis. 

So, our function is above the x-axis in these spots I'm highlighting in yellow:
- In one spot between $$x = a$$ and $$x = b$$.
- Another spot after $$x = c$$.

If we write these intervals mathematically:
- The function is positive for $$a < x < b$$.
- And for $$x > c$$.

Now, when is the function negative? This happens when its value is less than zero — so the function will be below the x-axis.

We can see it is below the x-axis:
- When $$x < a$$.
- And when $$b < x < c$$.

Next, let's talk about when the function is increasing or decreasing.

When a function is increasing, as you move to the right (increase x), the y values go up. This means the slope of the tangent line is positive. 

Our graph is increasing:
- Until it reaches $$x = d$$.
- And starts increasing again after $$x = e$$.

Mathematically, it's increasing for:
- $$x < d$$.
- And for $$x > e$$.

When a function is decreasing, the y values go down as you move to the right. Here, the slope of the tangent line is negative.

Our graph is decreasing:
- Between $$x = d$$ and $$x = e$$.

So, it decreases for $$d < x < e$$.

Notice, these intervals for increasing/decreasing and positive/negative don't always match perfectly. It's important to think about them separately even if they might seem similar.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
