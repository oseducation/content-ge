Sure, let's work through this problem step by step together! 

First, let's recap what we're given:

- Yochanan walked from home to the bus stop at an average speed of 5 kilometers per hour.
- After that, he took the bus which traveled at 60 kilometers per hour until he reached school.
- The total distance he traveled from home to school is 35 kilometers.
- The total time taken for the whole trip is 1.5 hours.

Our goal is to find out how many kilometers Yochanan walked and how many kilometers he traveled on the bus.

Let's start by setting up some variables:

- Let $$W$$ represent the distance Yochanan walked.
- Let $$B$$ represent the distance he traveled by bus.

From the given information, we know:
$$W + B = 35 \text{ kilometers}.$$

We also know the total travel time is 1.5 hours:
$$\text{Time walking} + \text{Time on bus} = 1.5 \text{ hours}.$$

The time Yochanan spent walking can be calculated as:
$$\frac{W}{5}$$
since time = distance / speed.

Similarly, the time spent on the bus can be calculated as:
$$\frac{B}{60}.$$

So our second equation based on time is:
$$\frac{W}{5} + \frac{B}{60} = 1.5.$$

Now we have two equations:
1. $$W + B = 35$$
2. $$\frac{W}{5} + \frac{B}{60} = 1.5.$$

Let's solve these step by step.

First, let's get rid of the fractions in the second equation by multiplying everything by 60:
$$60 \left(\frac{W}{5}\right) + 60 \left(\frac{B}{60}\right) = 60 \times 1.5.$$

This simplifies to:
$$12W + B = 90.$$

Now, we have:
1. $$W + B = 35$$
2. $$12W + B = 90.$$

Let's solve these two equations by using the elimination method.

Subtract the first equation from the second:
$$(12W + B) - (W + B) = 90 - 35,$$
which simplifies to:
$$11W = 55.$$

So:
$$W = 5 \text{ kilometers}.$$

Since $$W + B = 35$$, substitute $$W = 5$$ into the first equation:
$$5 + B = 35.$$

Thus:
$$B = 30 \text{ kilometers}.$$

So, Yochanan walked 5 kilometers and traveled 30 kilometers by bus.
