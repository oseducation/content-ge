Sure! Let's dive into it together:

We're asked to find out where the solutions for three inequalities overlap. A good way to start is to graph each inequality and see where the shaded areas intersect. This overlapping region is where all the inequalities hold true. 

First, let's graph $$y = 2x + 1$$. This line includes all points where $$y$$ is greater than or equal to the line itself. The $$y$$-intercept is at 1 (when $$x$$ is 0, $$y$$ is 1). The slope is 2, which means for every step to the right on the $$x$$-axis, we go up 2 steps on the $$y$$-axis. So, if we plot a few points, the line will look something like this: 

* When $$x = 0$$, $$y = 1$$
* When $$x = 1$$, $$y = 3$$
* When $$x = 2$$, $$y = 5$$

Now, shade the area above this line, including the line itself, to show $$y \geq 2x + 1$$.

Next, we graph $$y < 2x - 5$$. Note that these two lines are parallel because they have the same slope of 2. The $$y$$-intercept for this line is -5 (when $$x$$ is 0, $$y$$ is -5). So, plot a few points:

* When $$x = 0$$, $$y = -5$$
* When $$x = 1$$, $$y = -3$$
* When $$x = 2$$, $$y = -1$$

Since it's strictly less than, we draw a dotted line and shade the area below the line. 

Now, let's look at the overlap of the shaded areas from these first two inequalities. Because the lines are parallel and the shaded areas don't touch at all, there's no point that satisfies both inequalities at the same time. So, no overlap means no solution.

Even though we have another inequality, $$x > 1$$, we don't need to graph it because there is already no overlap from the first two inequalities. The solution set is empty. That means there are no values for $$x$$ and $$y$$ that can satisfy all three inequalities at once.

The solution set of the system is empty, also known as the null set.
