Alright, let's break this down together in simpler terms. We're going to talk about the domain of a function $$f(x)$$ and its range by looking at its graph.

### Finding the Domain

#### Example 1:
Look at the function $$f(x)$$ on the graph. We need to find where $$f(x)$$ is defined (its domain).

**Step-by-Step:**
1. If you try $$x = -9$$ or any $$x$$ less than $$-6$$, you'll see there's no graph there.
2. The graph starts at $$x = -6$$ and goes up to $$x = 7$$.
3. So, $$f(x)$$ is defined from $$x = -6$$ to $$x = 7$$.

In math words, the domain is: 
$$ -6 \leq x \leq 7 $$

#### Example 2:
Look at another function $$f(x)$$ on the graph.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. If you try $$x = -9$$ or any $$x$$ less than $$-1$$, there's no graph there.
2. The graph starts at $$x = -1$$ and goes up to $$x = 7$$.
3. So, $$f(x)$$ is defined from $$x = -1$$ to $$x = 7$$.

In math words, the domain is: 
$$ -1 \leq x \leq 7 $$

### Finding the Range

Now, let's talk about the range of $$f(x)$$, which is about the $$y$$ values.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Look at the graph and find the lowest $$y$$ value. In this case, it's $$0$$.
2. The highest $$y$$ value on the graph is $$8$$.
3. So, the range of $$f(x)$$ is from $$0$$ to $$8$$.

In math words, the range is: 
$$ 0 \leq f(x) \leq 8 $$

### Another Domain Example:

#### Example 3:
Look at one more function $$f(x)$$ on the graph.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. The graph starts at $$x = -2$$ and goes up to $$x = 5$$.
2. So, $$f(x)$$ is defined from $$x = -2$$ to $$x = 5$$.

In math words, the domain is:
$$ -2 \leq x \leq 5 $$

I hope this helps make sense of how to find the domain and range of a function by looking at its graph! If you have more questions or want to practice more, feel free to ask!
