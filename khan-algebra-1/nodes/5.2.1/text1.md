Sure! Let's break it down and make it easy.

We're asked to draw the graph of $$y = \frac{1}{3}x - 2$$. This type of equation is called the slope-intercept form. Basically, it's written as $$y = mx + b$$, where:

- $$m$$ is the slope of the line.
- $$b$$ is the y-intercept, which is where the line crosses the y-axis.

In our case:
- $$m = \frac{1}{3}$$
- $$b = -2$$

Let's understand these parts. For the y-intercept:
- This means the line crosses the y-axis at y = -2.
- When $$x = 0$$, $$y = -2$$. So one point on the graph is (0, -2).

Now, for the slope:
- The slope $$\frac{1}{3}$$ tells us how steep the line is.
- It means for every 3 steps you take to the right (along the x-axis), you go 1 step up (along the y-axis).

So, starting at the point (0, -2):
1. Move 3 steps to the right: (3, -2).
2. Then, move 1 step up: (3, -1).

You can plot these points: (0, -2) and (3, -1).

To double-check:
- If you move 3 steps left (3 steps down along x-axis), you move 1 step down on the y-axis.
- For example, from (0, -2), if you go left to (-3, -2), then go down to (-3, -3).

Connecting these points will give you the line:
- It should go through (0, -2) and (3, -1), and you can see the slope is the same all along.

And thatâ€™s the graph of $$y = \frac{1}{3}x - 2$$. Easy, right?
