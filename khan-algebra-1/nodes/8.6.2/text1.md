Hi there! Let's go through some examples of finding domains of functions together. Imagine you're solving these with me.

### Example 1:
We have the function $$f(x) = \frac{x+5}{x-2}$$. What is the domain of this function? Pause here and give it a try!

Okay, let's work through it together. The domain is the set of all $$x$$ values that we can input into the function and still get a real output. When won't this work? If the bottom part (denominator) becomes zero, the function is undefined because we can't divide by zero.

So, we need $$x-2 \neq 0$$. Adding 2 to both sides, we get $$x \neq 2$$. Thus, the domain is all real $$x$$ values except $$x=2$$.

### Example 2:
Now, let's say $$g(x) = \sqrt{x-7}$$. What's the domain here? Pause and think about it.

Great! Let's solve it together. For the square root function, the inside (what's under the square root) must be greater than or equal to zero because we can't take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers.

So, $$x-7 \geq 0$$. Adding 7 to both sides, we get $$x \geq 7$$. Therefore, the domain is all real $$x$$ values greater than or equal to 7.

### Example 3:
Lastly, consider $$h(x) = (x-5)^2$$. What is the domain here?

The domain is all real $$x$$ values because there's no restriction. We can square any real number and get a real result. Therefore, the domain here includes all real numbers.

In the first two examples, we had to make sure the function wouldn't break (by avoiding division by zero or taking the square root of a negative). In the last one, there was no such problem. 

I hope this helps you understand domains of functions better! Feel free to ask more questions if you have any.
