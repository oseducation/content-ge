Sure! Let's chat about expressions with more than one variable. Imagine we have an expression like $$a + b$$. We want to figure out what this expression equals when $$a = 7$$ and $$b = 2$$. 

I suggest you pause and try to solve it yourself first! 

When you see $$a$$ in the expression, replace it with $$7$$. When you see $$b$$, replace it with $$2$$. So, the expression becomes $$7 + 2$$. And we know that equals $$9$$. So, for these values of $$a$$ and $$b$$, the expression is $$9$$.

Let's try a slightly harder one. Suppose we have $$x \cdot y - y + 3x$$. We need to find out what it equals when $$x = 3$$ and $$y = 2$$.

Again, I encourage you to pause and give it a try yourself! 

This time, replace $$x$$ with $$3$$ and $$y$$ with $$2$$. So the expression becomes $$3 \cdot 2 - 2 + 3 \cdot 3$$. 

Now let's solve it step-by-step. 
- First, $$3 \cdot 2$$ is $$6$$.
- Then, $$3 \cdot 3$$ is $$9$$.
  
So we have $$6 - 2 + 9$$. That simplifies to:
- $$6 - 2$$ which is $$4$$.
- And finally $$4 + 9$$ equals $$13$$.

So, when $$x = 3$$ and $$y = 2$$, the expression equals $$13$$. Great job!
