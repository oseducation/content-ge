Hey there! Let's work on graphing the inequality $$y < 3x + 5$$ together. First, let's set up our x and y-axes.

1. **Label the Axes:**
    - The horizontal line is the x-axis.
    - The vertical line is the y-axis.

2. **Find Points to Graph:**
    - We need to understand what happens to $$y$$ for different $$x$$ values based on the formula $$3x + 5$$.
    - For example, if $$x = 1$$, we plug it into $$3x + 5$$:
      $$ 3 \cdot 1 + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 $$
      So, when $$x = 1$$, $$y < 8$$.

3. **Visualizing the Points:**
    - For $$x = 1$$, $$y$$ can be any value less than 8. So, you'll mark everything below 8 on the graph.
    - Now let's do it for other x-values like $$x = -1$$. Plugging -1:
      $$3 \cdot (-1) + 5 = -3 + 5 = 2 $$
      So, when $$x = -1$$, $$y < 2$$.

4. **Graphing the Line $$y = 3x + 5$$ as a Dotted Line:**
    - The slope ($$m$$) is 3, and the y-intercept ($$b$$) is 5.
    - Start from the point (0, 5) on the y-axis.
    - Use the slope: for each step right (positive $$x$$), go up 3 units.

      Connect these points with a dotted line because $$y$$ is less than the line, not equal to it.

5. **Shading the Area:**
    - The area below this dotted line represents all $$y$$ values less than $$3x + 5$$.
    - Shade this entire region below the line to show where the inequality $$y < 3x + 5$$ holds true.

So, for any x-value you choose, the $$y$$ value should be below this dotted line. The shaded region under the dotted line represents all solutions to the inequality $$y < 3x + 5$$. I hope this helps you understand how to graph inequalities!
