Hey there! Let's dive into some fun with piecewise functions and see if we can make this all nice and clear.

First, let’s look at the piecewise function we have, which is called $$f(t)$$. It's broken into three parts based on the value of $$t$$:

1. If $$t \leq -10$$, we use the first part.
2. If $$-10 < t < -2$$, we use the second part.
3. If $$t \geq -2$$, we use the third part.

Okay, so we need to find the value of $$f(-10)$$. Since $$-10$$ is exactly $$-10$$, we fall into the first part. Here’s how it looks:

$$ f(t) = -10^2 - 5 \cdot (-10) $$

Let’s solve this:

- $$-10^2$$ is $$100$$.
- $$-5 \cdot (-10)$$ is $$50$$.

Add them together: $$100 + 50 = 150$$. So, $$f(-10) = 150$$.

Now, let’s do another example with a different function called $$h(x)$$. We need to find $$h(-3)$$. The function tells us:

- Use the first part if $$x$$ is between $$-\infty$$ and $$0$$.

Since $$-3$$ is between those values, we use this part:

$$ h(x) = (-3)^3 $$

Calculating it:

- $$(-3)^3 = -27$$

So, $$h(-3) = -27$$.

Alright, one more example but with a step function called $$g(x)$$. Here’s the graph and let’s see the values at certain points.

1. $$g(-3.0001)$$ – This spot is right between $$-4$$ and $$-3$$ on the graph, where $$g(x) = 3$$. So, $$g(-3.0001) = 3$$.

2. $$g(3.99999)$$ – This is just before $$4$$ and we see $$g(x)$$ at this spot is $$7$$. So, $$g(3.99999) = 7$$.

3. $$g(4.00001)$$ – Just a tiny bit more than $$4$$, and the graph drops down to $$-3$$. So, $$g(4.00001) = -3$$.

Finally, for $$g(9)$$ – Looking at $$x=9$$, we see an open circle at $$-3$$, meaning it’s not defined there. So, $$g(9) =$$ undefined.

Isn’t that interesting? Let me know if you have any questions or need more examples!
