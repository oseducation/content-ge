Sure, let's break this down step by step!

Alright, let's start. Imagine that today, Arman is 18 years old and Diya is 2 years old. I want to figure out how many years from now Arman will be three times as old as Diya.

First, we need to think about how many years this will take. Let's call this number of years $$y$$. So, $$y$$ represents how many years it will be until Arman is three times as old as Diya.

Now, let's see how old Arman will be in $$y$$ years. Right now, Arman is 18 years old. In $$y$$ years, he will be $$18 + y$$ years old. What about Diya? She is 2 years old now, so in $$y$$ years, she will be $$2 + y$$ years old.

We want to find out when Arman's age will be three times Diya's age. So, we can set up an equation like this:
$$
18 + y = 3 \cdot (2 + y)
$$

Now let's solve this step by step.

First, distribute the 3 on the right side:
$$
18 + y = 6 + 3y
$$

Next, we want to get all the y terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. Let's subtract $$y$$ from both sides:
$$
18 = 6 + 2y
$$

Then, subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the $$y$$ term:
$$
12 = 2y
$$

Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for $$y$$:
$$
y = 6
$$

So, it will take 6 years for Arman to be three times as old as Diya.

To check, let's see how old they will be in 6 years: 
- Arman will be $$18 + 6 = 24$$ years old.
- Diya will be $$2 + 6 = 8$$ years old.

And indeed, 24 is three times 8, so our solution works!

In 6 years, Arman will be three times as old as Diya. Great job!
