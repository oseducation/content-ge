Hey there! Let's break this problem down together.

We have a ball that is shot into the air from the edge of a building that's 50 feet high (above the ground). The ball's initial speed is 20 feet per second. We can use the equation:

$$ h = -16t^2 + 20t + 50 $$

Here, $$ h $$ stands for height, and $$ t $$ is the time in seconds. This equation shows the height of the ball after $$ t $$ seconds. In this problem, we're using this formula without worrying about how it was derived.

Now, we want to find out how long it takes for the ball to hit the ground. The ground level is when the height $$ h $$ equals 0. So, we need to solve the equation:

$$ 0 = -16t^2 + 20t + 50 $$

Let's make this equation simpler. We can divide everything by -2 to get rid of the negative sign in front of $$ 16t^2 $$:

$$ 0 = 8t^2 - 10t - 25 $$

Our goal now is to solve for $$ t $$ using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is:

$$ t = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a} $$

In our equation $$ 8t^2 - 10t - 25 = 0 $$:

- $$ a = 8 $$
- $$ b = -10 $$
- $$ c = -25 $$

Plugging these into the quadratic formula, we get:

$$ t = \frac{{-(-10) \pm \sqrt{{(-10)^2 - 4(8)(-25)}}}}{2(8)} $$

This simplifies to:

$$ t = \frac{{10 \pm \sqrt{{100 + 800}}}}{16} $$

Because:

- $$ (-10)^2 = 100 $$
- $$ 4 \times 8 \times -25 = -800 $$
- Adding them: $$ 100 + 800 = 900 $$

So, we now have:

$$ t = \frac{{10 \pm \sqrt{900}}}{16} $$

Since $$ \sqrt{900} = 30 $$, we get:

$$ t = \frac{{10 \pm 30}}{16} $$

This gives us two possible values for $$ t $$:

1. $$ t = \frac{{10 + 30}}{16} = \frac{40}{16} = 2.5 $$
2. $$ t = \frac{{10 - 30}}{16} = \frac{-20}{16} = -1.25 $$

Since time can't be negative, we only take the positive value:

$$ t = 2.5 \text{ seconds} $$

To make sure, let's quickly check by plugging $$ t = 2.5 $$ back into the original equation:

$$ h = -16(2.5)^2 + 20(2.5) + 50 $$

This becomes:

$$ h = -16 \times 6.25 + 50 + 50 = -100 + 50 + 50 = 0 $$

So, it checks out! The ball hits the ground after 2.5 seconds.
