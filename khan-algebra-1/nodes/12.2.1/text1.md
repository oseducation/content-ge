Alright, let's break this down together in a simple and friendly way. Imagine you put $3,800 in a savings account, and the bank says it will grow by 1.8% every year. We need to figure out how much money you'll have in the account after 15 years. Ready? Let’s go!

First, at the very start (year 0), you have $3,800. We can write this as:
$$3800$$

Next, let’s think about the first year. By the end of year one, the bank will add 1.8% interest to your $3,800. In math terms, that looks like this:
$$3800 + 0.018 \times 3800$$

We can simplify this by factoring out the $3,800:
$$3800 \times (1 + 0.018)$$
$$3800 \times 1.018$$

Now we know how much money you'll have after one year: $$3800 \times 1.018$$.

What about after two years? Well, you start the second year with the amount you ended the first year with, which is $3800 \times 1.018. And then it grows 1.8% again:
$$3800 \times 1.018 \times 1.018$$
Or:
$$3800 \times 1.018^2$$

By now, you probably see the pattern. Each year, you multiply by 1.018 again. So, after 15 years, you would have:
$$3800 \times 1.018^{15}$$

This way of growing your money by multiplying each year is called compound growth. Even though 1.8% might seem small, over 15 years, it adds up!

We could use a calculator to find the exact amount, but the important part is setting up the expression:
$$3800 \times 1.018^{15}$$

That’s the expression that tells you how much money you'll have in the account after 15 years.
