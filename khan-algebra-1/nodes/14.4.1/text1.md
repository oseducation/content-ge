Hey there! Let's chat about these equations. You might not realize it at first, but these three equations are actually the same. They've just been changed a bit using algebra. They are in different forms. One is in standard form, another in factored form, and the last one is in vertex form. In this chat, we'll focus on the vertex form and understand why it's called that.

First, let's remind ourselves what a "vertex" is. When you graph a quadratic equation (like $$y = ax^2 + bx + c$$), you get a U-shaped curve called a "parabola". This parabola can open upwards or downwards. If it opens upwards, it'll look something like this \(\mathbf{\small{\cup}}\). The lowest point on this curve is called the "vertex". If it opens downwards, it'll look something like this \(\mathbf{\small{\cap}}\) and the highest point is the vertex.

Now, why is it called vertex form? It's because you can easily find the vertex in this form. Let's look at an equation in vertex form: 
\[ y = 3(x + 2)^2 - 27 \]

Notice the part \((x + 2)^2\)? No matter what value \(x\) takes, this part is never negative because squaring any number (positive or negative) makes it positive or zero. So, the smallest value this part can be is 0. When is it 0? When \(x + 2 = 0\). This happens when \(x = -2\). So, the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is \(-2\).

Now, for the \(y\)-coordinate, we see that when \((x + 2)^2\) is 0, we just have \(y = -27\). So, the vertex of this parabola is at \((-2, -27)\).

Let's try another example. Suppose we have:
\[ y = -2(x - 5)^2 + 10 \]

Here, see how \((x - 5)^2\) is always non-negative too? But since it's multiplied by \(-2\), it becomes non-positive, meaning it's zero or negative. This means the parabola opens downwards. The highest point (vertex) happens when \((x - 5)^2 = 0\). This happens when \(x = 5\). So, the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is 5.

For the \(y\)-coordinate, if \((x - 5)^2 = 0\), then \(y = 10\). So, the vertex is at \((5, 10)\).

One more example to be sure. Let's say:
\[ y = -\pi(x - 2.8)^2 + 7.1 \]

Find the \(x\)-value that makes \((x - 2.8)^2\) zero, which is \(x = 2.8\). And for the \(y\)-coordinate, if this part is zero, \(y = 7.1\). So, the vertex is at \((2.8, 7.1)\).

Do you see why it's called vertex form now? It's super easy to pick out the vertex from the equation. We'll do more practice in future lessons to get even better at this. Keep up the great work!
