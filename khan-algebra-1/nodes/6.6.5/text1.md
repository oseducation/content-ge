Sure! Let's go through this step-by-step together.

A factory has machines that make toys, and workers who pack these toys. On one day, each machine made 14 toys and each worker packed 2 toys. After packing, there were 40 toys left unpacked. Also, the number of workers was 8 less than 7 times the number of machines. How many machines and workers were there?

To solve this:
- Let’s say $$M$$ is the number of machines.
- Let’s say $$W$$ is the number of workers.

First, we know each machine made 14 toys, so in total, the machines made $$14M$$ toys.

Next, each worker packed 2 toys, so the workers packed $$2W$$ toys.

Since there were 40 toys left unpacked, we can write an equation for that:
$$14M - 2W = 40$$ 

Additionally, we know the number of workers is 8 less than 7 times the number of machines. This can be written as:
$$W = 7M - 8$$ 

Now, we have two equations:
1. $$14M - 2W = 40$$
2. $$W = 7M - 8$$

To solve these equations, we can substitute the second equation into the first one. So, replace $$W$$ with $$7M - 8$$ in the first equation:
$$14M - 2(7M - 8) = 40$$

Let's simplify this:
$$14M - 2(7M) + 2(8) = 40$$
$$14M - 14M + 16 = 40$$

The terms $$14M$$ cancel out, and we're left with:
$$16 = 40$$ 

But that's impossible because 16 is not equal to 40. Since this doesn’t make sense, it means there are no values of $$M$$ and $$W$$ that satisfy both equations.

So, there is no solution to this problem.
