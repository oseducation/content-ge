Hey there! Let's talk about how we can graph inequalities on a coordinate plane. Imagine we have the inequality $$y \leq 4x + 3$$. We want to find and show all the points $(x, y)$ that make this inequality true.

First, let's break it down. We know how to graph $$y = 4x + 3$$, right? So we can think of $$y \leq 4x + 3$$ as two parts:
1. $$y < 4x + 3$$
2. $$y = 4x + 3$$

We'll start with the line $$y = 4x + 3$$. On the graph, this line will include all points where $$y$$ is equal to $$4x + 3$$.

### Graphing the Line
1. **y-intercept**: The y-intercept is 3, which means the line crosses the y-axis at $(0, 3)$.
2. **Slope**: The slope is 4, which means for every step right in the x-direction, we go up 4 steps in the y-direction.

Let's plot that:
- Starting at $(0, 3)$, if we move 1 step to the right (to $x = 1$), we go up 4 steps to $y = 7$. So, one point is $(1, 7)$.
- If we move 1 step to the left (to $x = -1$), we go down 4 steps to $y = -1$. So, another point is $(-1, -1)$.

Draw a straight line through these points. This line represents $$y = 4x + 3$$.

### Understanding "less than or equal to"
Next, we need to show all points where $$y$$ is less than or equal to this line. For that:
- When $$x = 0$$, $$y < 3$$. So, all points below $(0, 3)$.
- When $$x = -1$$, $$y < -1$$. So, all points below $(-1, -1)$.
- When $$x = 1$$, $$y < 7$$. So, all points below $(1, 7)$.

We're looking for all points below the line $$y = 4x + 3$$.

### Shading the Region
Shade the area below the line to represent all points where $$y \leq 4x + 3$$. If it was just $$y < 4x + 3$$ (without the "equal to"), we would draw a dashed line instead of a solid line to show that the line itself is not included.

### Another Example
Let’s do another one: $$y > -\frac{x}{2} - 6$$.
1. **y-intercept**: The y-intercept is -6, so the line crosses the y-axis at $(0, -6)$.
2. **Slope**: The slope is -1/2, meaning every 2 steps right in the x-direction, we go down 1 step in the y-direction.

Plotting it:
- Starting at $(0, -6)$, move 2 steps right (to $x = 2$), go down 1 step (to $y = -7$), giving us $(2, -7)$.
- Going left 2 steps (to $x = -2$), go up 1 step (to $y = -5$), giving us $(-2, -5)$.

Draw the line through these points.

### Understanding "greater than"
For $$y > -\frac{x}{2} - 6$$, we want all points where $$y$$ is above this line.
- For any $$x$$, the $$y$$ value must be greater than the line value.

### Shading and Dashed Line
Since it’s "greater than" (not "equal to"), we draw a dashed line. Then, shade the area above the line.

By practicing, it becomes easier to see how these inequalities work on the graph. I hope this helps you understand and visualize graphing inequalities!
