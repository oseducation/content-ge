Hey there! In the previous video, we talked about why dividing any non-zero number by zero is considered undefined by mathematicians. But that might have made you wonder: what about zero divided by zero? Could there be a reason to define it?

Let's think about $$\frac{0}{0}$$. There are a couple of ways people try to understand it:

First, let's divide numbers that are getting closer to zero by themselves. For example:
- $$\frac{0.1}{0.1} = 1$$
- $$\frac{0.001}{0.001} = 1$$
- $$\frac{0.000001}{0.000001} = 1$$

Even if these numbers are negative, we still get:
- $$\frac{-0.1}{-0.1} = 1$$
- $$\frac{-0.001}{-0.001} = 1$$

So, one might think that $$\frac{0}{0}$$ should be $$1$$.

But another way to look at it is by dividing zero by numbers that are getting closer to zero. For example:
- $$\frac{0}{0.1} = 0$$
- $$\frac{0}{0.001} = 0$$
- $$\frac{0}{0.000001} = 0$$

Even if these numbers are negative, we get:
- $$\frac{0}{-0.1} = 0$$
- $$\frac{0}{-0.001} = 0$$

This makes it seem like $$\frac{0}{0}$$ could be $$0$$.

Both of these reasons seem valid, but they lead to different answers. Since neither way is consistent with all of math, mathematicians have decided that $$\frac{0}{0}$$ is undefined.
