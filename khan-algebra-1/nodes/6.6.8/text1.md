Hey there! Let's solve a math problem together. Imagine you go to a fruit stand. The person in front of you buys 5 apples and 4 oranges for $10. Then, you get 5 apples and 5 oranges for $11. We want to find the price of each apple and each orange using a system of linear equations.

Let's use $$x$$ to represent the price of an apple and $$y$$ to represent the price of an orange. 

For the person in front of you:
- They bought 5 apples. So, they spent $$5x$$ on apples.
- They also bought 4 oranges. So, they spent $$4y$$ on oranges.
- In total, they spent $$5x + 4y$$ and paid $10. So, we have:
  $$
  5x + 4y = 10
  $$

Now, for you:
- You bought 5 apples and spent $$5x$$ on apples.
- You also bought 5 oranges and spent $$5y$$ on oranges.
- In total, you spent $$5x + 5y$$ and paid $11. So, we have:
  $$
  5x + 5y = 11
  $$

We can solve these equations to find $$x$$ and $$y$$.

First, let's subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $$x$$:
  $$
  (5x + 4y) - (5x + 5y) = 10 - 11
  $$
This simplifies to:
  $$
  5x + 4y - 5x - 5y = -1
  $$
  $$
  -y = -1
  $$
Divide both sides by -1:
  $$
  y = 1
  $$

So the price of an orange is $1. Now let's find the price of an apple. We can use the first equation:
  $$
  5x + 4(1) = 10
  $$
  $$
  5x + 4 = 10
  $$
Subtract 4 from both sides:
  $$
  5x = 6
  $$
Divide both sides by 5:
  $$
  x = \frac{6}{5}
  $$

Which is $$x = 1.20$$ when converted to dollars.

So, the price of each apple is $1.20, and the price of each orange is $1. We did it! Using the information given, we solved the prices with a system of linear equations. Great job!
