Hi there! Let’s explore the temperature changes in Windhoek, Namibia, and figure out when the temperature increased faster. 

So, we have a function, $$T(t)$$, which represents the temperature $$T$$ in degrees Celsius at $$t$$ hours after midnight. Here’s the table of some values:

- At 6 hours after midnight (6 a.m.), the temperature is 19°C.
- At 9 hours after midnight (9 a.m.), the temperature is 25°C.
- At 13 hours after midnight (1 p.m.), the temperature is 31°C.

We need to find out when the temperature increased faster: between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. or between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. So, let's calculate the rate of temperature change (rate of increase) in both time intervals.

The rate of change is the change in temperature divided by the change in time, which we can write as:

$$ \text{Rate of change} = \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t} $$

where $$\Delta$$ (the triangle) means "change in."

1. **Between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m.:**
   - Change in temperature, $$\Delta T$$: from 19°C to 25°C, which is 25°C - 19°C = 6°C.
   - Change in time, $$\Delta t$$: from 6 hours to 9 hours, which is 9 - 6 = 3 hours.

   So the rate of change is:

   $$ \frac{6 \text{°C}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{°C per hour} $$

2. **Between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m.:**
   - Change in temperature, $$\Delta T$$: from 25°C to 31°C, which is 31°C - 25°C = 6°C.
   - Change in time, $$\Delta t$$: from 9 hours to 13 hours, which is 13 - 9 = 4 hours.

   So the rate of change is:

   $$ \frac{6 \text{°C}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 1.5 \text{°C per hour} $$

When comparing the two rates, 2°C per hour is faster than 1.5°C per hour. 

This means the temperature increased faster between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. than between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Fantastic job understanding this! Keep up the good work!
