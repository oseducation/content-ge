- Hi there! When Quinn came back from his break, he turned the heat on in his house. He set the temperature to the highest it could go. In this case, $$Q$$ shows the temperature in Quinn's house in degrees Celsius after $$t$$ minutes. The equation is:

$$Q = 15 + 0.4t$$

We need to find out what the temperature was when Quinn got back from his vacation. Go ahead and pause for a moment to see if you can figure it out by yourself.

Okay, let's solve it together. We need to know the temperature, and it might be a little confusing. Remember, $$t$$ represents time in minutes, not temperature. Temperature is $$Q$$. So, we want to know what $$Q$$ was right when Quinn returned from vacation, which is when $$t = 0$$.

If we put $$t = 0$$ into the equation, we get:

$$Q = 15 + 0.4 \cdot t$$

So:

$$Q = 15 + 0.4 \cdot 0 = 15$$ degrees Celsius.

If you know about the slope-intercept form, think of this as:

$$\text{temperature} = 0.4 \cdot (\text{elapsed time}) + 15$$

When $$t = 0$$, you only have the number 15, which is the starting temperature (like the y-intercept in graphs).

Now, let's see how much the temperature increases every minute. One way to understand this is by recognizing that 0.4 is the slope of the line. This means that for each minute that passes, the temperature goes up by 0.4 degrees Celsius.

Let's try some examples. 

- At $$t = 0$$, the temperature is $$15$$ degrees Celsius.
- At $$t = 1$$, the temperature becomes:

$$Q = 15 + 0.4 \cdot 1 = 15.4$$ degrees Celsius. 

So, for each minute that passes, the temperature increases by 0.4 degrees.

Let's see what happens if we increase the time by two minutes (from $$t = 1$$ to $$t = 2$$):

- At $$t = 2$$, the temperature is:

$$Q = 15 + 0.4 \cdot 2 = 15.8$$ degrees Celsius.

Again, the temperature went up by 0.4 degrees.

Next question: How much will the temperature increase if Quinn leaves the heat on for 20 minutes? Pause the video and see if you can solve it.

Let's continue. Be careful here. They aren't asking for the temperature after 20 minutes, but how much it increases after 20 minutes.

If we wanted the temperature after 20 minutes, we would do:

$$Q = 15 + 0.4 \cdot 20 = 15 + 8 = 23$$ degrees Celsius.

But they want to know the increase. We started at 15 degrees Celsius. After 20 minutes, it went up to 23 degrees Celsius. So, the increase is:

$$23 - 15 = 8$$ degrees Celsius.

Or, simply put:

$$0.4 \cdot 20 = 8$$ degrees Celsius.

And weâ€™re done!
