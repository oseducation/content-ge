Hey there! Let's chat about what we learned. We now know a little bit about variables. Remember, a variable can be any symbol, but we usually use letters because we're so used to them. You might see $$x$$, $$y$$, $$z$$, $$a$$, $$b$$, and sometimes even Greek letters like $$\theta$$. Really, any symbol works to show something that can change.

Out of all the symbols, $$x$$ is the most common in math. But this can be a bit tricky since $$x$$ looks a lot like the multiplication symbol. For example, in arithmetic, you might write $$2 \times 3$$, but if you want to write $$2$$ times $$x$$ in algebra, writing $$2 \times x$$ can be confusing. It can look like "Two 'x' 'x'" or "two times times something."

To avoid this confusion, we have a few different ways to show multiplication in algebra:

1. You could use a dot like this: $$2 \cdot x$$. This dot is not a decimal point; it's just to show multiplication.
   
2. You can put $$x$$ in parentheses: $$2(x)$$. This also means $$2$$ times $$x$$.
   
3. The most common way is to write $$2x$$. This is read as "two times x."

You might wonder why we didn't always do this in basic arithmetic. If we wrote "23" instead of "2 \times 3," it would look like the number twenty-three, and that's confusing. But with a letter like $$x$$, it's clear we're multiplying.

Let's try some examples!

1. If we have $$10 - 3y$$ and $$y = 2$$, we replace $$y$$ with $$2$$:
   $$
   10 - 3 \cdot 2.
   $$
   First, multiply $$3 \cdot 2 = 6$$. Then, $$10 - 6 = 4$$.

2. For $$7x - 4$$ when $$x = 3$$, we replace $$x$$ with $$3$$:
   $$
   7 \cdot 3 - 4.
   $$
   First, multiply $$7 \cdot 3 = 21$$. Then, $$21 - 4 = 17$$.

I hope this helps! Try the next exercises to get more practice with these concepts. Youâ€™ll get plenty of chances to get comfortable with this!
