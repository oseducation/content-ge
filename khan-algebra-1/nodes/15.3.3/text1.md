Sure! Let's chat about this topic together. I want to show you that between any two rational numbers, you can always find an irrational number.

First, let's understand what we're talking about. A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction, like $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{3}{4}$. An irrational number is a number that can't be written as a simple fraction, like $\sqrt{2}$ or $\pi$.

Imagine you have two rational numbers, $$r_1$$ and $$r_2$$, where $$r_2$$ is bigger than $$r_1$$. I want to prove that no matter what these two rational numbers are, there is always an irrational number between them.

Let's start by thinking about the space between 0 and 1. We know there are irrational numbers between 0 and 1. For example, $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ or $$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$, which is about 0.7071. This number goes on forever without repeating, which makes it irrational.

So, $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ is clearly between 0 and 1. Now, let's use this idea to find an irrational number between our two rational numbers, $$r_1$$ and $$r_2$$.

First, we see how far apart $$r_1$$ and $$r_2$$ are. This distance is $$r_2 - r_1$$. If we multiply $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$ by this distance, we get $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (r_2 - r_1)$$. This number is still irrational, and it’s between 0 and $$r_2 - r_1$$.

Next, we add $$r_1$$ to this number: 
$$ r_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (r_2 - r_1)$$.

Now, let’s check if this new number is between $$r_1$$ and $$r_2$$:

- It’s more than $$r_1$$ because we’ve added something positive to $$r_1$$.
- It’s less than $$r_2$$ because when you add $$r_1$$ to something less than $$r_2 - r_1$$, you get something less than $$r_2$$.

So, we’ve found an irrational number,
$$ r_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (r_2 - r_1)$$, between any two rational numbers, $$r_1$$ and $$r_2$$.

This proves that no matter which two rational numbers you pick, there is always at least one irrational number between them! Isn’t that cool?
