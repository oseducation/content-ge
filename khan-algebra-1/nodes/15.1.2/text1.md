Sure, let's break it down together. We're trying to figure out which of these numbers can't be written as a ratio of two whole numbers. Those are called irrational numbers.

First, let's look at $$\frac{\sqrt{8}}{2}$$. If you take the square root of a number that's not a perfect square (like 8), you get an irrational number. Dividing that irrational number by 2 will still leave it irrational. So, $$\frac{\sqrt{8}}{2}$$ is irrational.

Next up is $$\pi$$ (pi). It’s a famous one that goes on forever without repeating: 3.14159… So, $$\pi$$ is definitely irrational.

Now let's check 5.0. We can write 5.0 as $$\frac{5}{1}$$, making it rational.

For 0.325, even though it's a decimal, it can be written as $$\frac{325}{1000}$$. So, 0.325 is rational.

Then we have 7.77777... (with the 7 going on forever). This repeating decimal can also be written as a fraction, which means it's rational.

Lastly, 8.5 (or 8 and 1/2). This one can be written as $$\frac{17}{2}$$, so it's rational too.

So, the two irrational numbers in the list are:
1. $$\frac{\sqrt{8}}{2}$$
2. $$\pi$$
