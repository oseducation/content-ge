Hey there! Let's chat about some interesting points in this graph we've got. I've graphed the function $$y = f(x)$$ over a certain stretch. It looks like it runs from 0 to some positive number. What we want to find are the highest and lowest points on this graph.

First off, let's talk about **absolute maximum** and **absolute minimum** points. On our graph, the absolute maximum happens right at the start, when $$x = 0$$. That means the highest point on this interval is $$f(0)$$. The absolute minimum happens at the other end. If we call this end point $$b$$, then the lowest point is $$f(b)$$.

Now, you might notice some other interesting points on the graph. There's a point, say at $$c$$, that's higher than the points around it, but not the highest overall. We call this a **relative maximum** because it's like a small hill compared to the nearby points. So, $$f(c)$$ is a relative maximum.

Similarly, there's another point, let's call it $$d$$, that is lower than the points around it, even though it's not the lowest overall. We call this a **relative minimum** or **local minimum**. So, $$f(d)$$ is a relative minimum.

To put it simply, a point $$f(c)$$ is a relative max if it's higher than the points close to $$c$$. Mathematically, we can say $$f(c)$$ is bigger than or equal to $$f(x)$$ for all $$x$$ near $$c$$. To be more clear, we can say for all $$x$$ in an open interval from $$c - h$$ to $$c + h$$, where $$h$$ is some small positive number.

For a relative minimum, we can say $$f(d)$$ is a relative min if it's lower than the points close to $$d$$. Mathematically, $$f(d)$$ is less than or equal to $$f(x)$$ for all $$x$$ in an open interval from $$d - h$$ to $$d + h$$, where $$h$$ is a small positive number.

In simpler terms:
- **Relative Maximum**: $$f(c)$$ is the highest value around $$c$$.
- **Relative Minimum**: $$f(d)$$ is the lowest value around $$d$$.

Feel free to pause and think about that. Does it make sense? Let me know if you have any questions or need more explanations!
