Hey there! Let's solve this problem together. Zoey gave her niece an electronic piggy bank, and it shows two pieces of information: how much money is inside and the total number of coins. After putting in some nickels and quarters, the display read $$\$2.00$$ and 16 coins. Our job is to find out how many nickels and quarters Zoey put in the bank.

Let's use some variables to make this easier:
- Let $$n$$ be the number of nickels.
- Let $$q$$ be the number of quarters.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 16. So, $$n + q = 16$$.
2. The total amount of money is $$\$2.00$$. Nickels are worth $$\$0.05$$ each and quarters are worth $$\$0.25$$ each. So, $$0.05n + 0.25q = 2.00$$.

We now have two equations:
1. $$n + q = 16$$
2. $$0.05n + 0.25q = 2.00$$

Letâ€™s solve these by substitution. We can solve the first equation for $$q$$:
$$q = 16 - n$$

Now, we'll substitute $$16 - n$$ for $$q$$ in the second equation:
$$0.05n + 0.25(16 - n) = 2.00$$

Let's simplify this step by step:

1. Distribute the $$0.25$$ in the equation:
$$0.05n + 0.25 \cdot 16 - 0.25n = 2.00$$
$$0.05n + 4 - 0.25n = 2.00$$

2. Combine like terms:
$$0.05n - 0.25n + 4 = 2.00$$
$$-0.20n + 4 = 2.00$$

3. Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate $$n$$:
$$-0.20n = 2.00 - 4.00$$
$$-0.20n = -2.00$$

4. Divide by $$-0.20$$:
$$n = \frac{-2.00}{-0.20}$$
$$n = 10$$

So, Zoey put in 10 nickels. Now, let's find out how many quarters:
$$q = 16 - n = 16 - 10 = 6$$

Zoey put in 10 nickels and 6 quarters. To check everything:
- Total coins: $$10 + 6 = 16$$ (correct)
- Total money: $$10 \times 0.05 + 6 \times 0.25 = 0.50 + 1.50 = 2.00$$ (correct)

Everything matches! Zoey put in 10 nickels and 6 quarters into the piggy bank. Great job! ðŸ™Œ
