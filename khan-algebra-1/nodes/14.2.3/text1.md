Sure! Let's go through this together in a friendly way.

- We have a rocket taking off from a platform, and its height in meters, $$x$$ seconds after the launch, is modeled by $$h(x) = -4(x + 2)(x - 18)$$. The first question is, what is the height of the rocket at the moment it is launched? 

To find this, we need to figure out the value of $$h(0)$$. Since $$x$$ is the number of seconds after launch, at the moment of launch, $$x = 0$$. So, we just substitute $$x = 0$$ into the equation: 
$$h(0) = -4(0 + 2)(0 - 18)$$

This simplifies to:
$$h(0) = -4 \times 2 \times -18 = 144$$

So, the height of the rocket at launch (when $$x = 0$$) is 144 meters.

- Next, we need to find how many seconds after launch the rocket will hit the ground. When the rocket hits the ground, its height is zero. So, we set the height equation equal to zero:
$$0 = -4(x + 2)(x - 18)$$

Now, we solve for $$x$$. One of the factors must be zero, but $$-4$$ canâ€™t be zero. So we look at:
$$x + 2 = 0$$
$$x = -2$$ 

And,
$$x - 18 = 0$$
$$x = 18$$

Since $$x = -2$$ means before the launch, we ignore it. Therefore, the rocket hits the ground 18 seconds after launch.

- How about the time when the rocket reaches its maximum height? The maximum height of a parabola, like this one, is at the midpoint between the two times it hits the ground. We've found it hits the ground at $$x = -2$$ and $$x = 18$$. We take the average of these two:

$$\frac{-2 + 18}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8$$

So, at $$x = 8$$ seconds, the rocket reaches its peak height.

- Finally, to find the maximum height itself, we evaluate $$h(8)$$:
$$h(8) = -4(8 + 2)(8 - 18)$$

This simplifies to:
$$h(8) = -4 \times 10 \times -10 = 400$$

So, the maximum height the rocket reaches is 400 meters.

Hope that makes everything clearer!
