Sure! Let's break it down in simpler terms. 

Imagine we're chatting about how many people are at the Copacabana beach at different times. Let's say $$P(t)$$ is the number of people at the beach at $$t$$ hours past midnight on a special day.

Now, when we look at the statement $$P(5) < P(9)$$, what does it really mean? 

Well, $$P(5)$$ is the number of people at the beach 5 hours after midnight (5 a.m.), and $$P(9)$$ is the number of people at the beach 9 hours after midnight (9 a.m.). This statement is saying that there are fewer people at 5 a.m. than at 9 a.m. So early in the morning at 5 a.m., you see fewer people than later in the morning at 9 a.m.

Let's go through some choices given to us.

1. **The time when there were five people at the beach is earlier than the time when there were nine people.** 
   - This is not true because 5 and 9 are not the number of people. They refer to the hours past midnight (time).
   
2. **There's more people at the beach at 9 a.m. than at 5 a.m.**
   - This is true! $$P(9)$$ (number of people at 9 a.m.) is greater than $$P(5)$$ (number of people at 5 a.m.). 

So, this choice correctly interprets that there are more people on the beach at 9 a.m. compared to 5 a.m. That's why we would choose this one.

Does this clear things up for you?
