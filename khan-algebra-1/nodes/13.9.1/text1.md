Alright! Let’s go over some quadratics and practice figuring out how to factor them. I’ll write down some examples, and I’d like you to try them on your own first. Ready?

The first quadratic is: 
$$6x^2 + 3x$$

Pause and see if you can factor this.

Does it jump out at you that both terms have a common factor? Both $$6$$ and $$3$$ are divisible by $$3$$, and both terms also include $$x$$. So, we can factor out $$3x$$.
$$6x^2 + 3x$$ can be written as:
$$3x(2x + 1)$$
We can't factor it any further. You can check your work by distributing the $$3x$$ to get back $$6x^2 + 3x$$. 

Good job! Now, let's try another one.

How about:
$$4x^2 - 4x - 48$$

Pause again and give it a try!

First, notice all terms are divisible by $$4$$. Factor out $$4$$:
$$4(x^2 - x - 12)$$

Next, we can factor the quadratic inside the parentheses more. We need two numbers whose sum equals $$-1$$ (the coefficient of $$x$$) and whose product equals $$-12$$ (the constant term). Think about the factors of $$12$$: 
$$-3$$ and $$4$$ add to $$-1$$ and multiply to $$-12$$. So it factors to:
$$4(x - 4)(x + 3)$$
Great job if you got that!

Let’s do one more. Here is:
$$3x^2 + 30x + 75$$

Give it a shot!

We can start by factoring out the common factor, which is $$3$$:
$$3(x^2 + 10x + 25)$$

Next, look inside the parentheses. We need two numbers that add to $$10$$ and multiply to $$25$$. Those numbers are $$5$$ and $$5$$, so it factors to:
$$3(x + 5)(x + 5)$$
or 
$$3(x + 5)^2$$

Fantastic! If you found this quadratic alone to be more challenging, don’t worry. Recognizing patterns and practicing different strategies really helps.

Remember, start by factoring out any common factors, then see if you can use the method of finding two numbers that add and multiply to the specific coefficients and constants in the quadratic.

Keep practicing, and these steps will become second nature! You’re doing great!
