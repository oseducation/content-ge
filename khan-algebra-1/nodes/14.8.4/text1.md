Sure! Let's dive into this together and make it simpler to understand. 

We need to find the roots of a quadratic equation by using the method called "completing the square." When someone mentions "roots," they're talking about the $$x$$ values where $$y$$ equals 0. In other words, we need to find the $$x$$ that makes the quadratic function equal to 0.

So, let’s start by setting $$y$$ to 0 and solving for $$x$$. Here's the equation we have:
$$0 = 4x^2 + 40x + 280$$

First, since all the terms can be divided by 4, let's do that to make things easier:
$$0 = x^2 + 10x + 70$$

Now, we need to use the "completing the square" method. This means we want to turn part of the expression into a perfect square. Let's focus on this part: $$x^2 + 10x$$.

To do this, take half of the 10 (which is 5), and then square it (5 squared is 25). We add this 25 inside the equation to help us complete the square:
$$0 = x^2 + 10x + 25 + 70 - 25$$

Notice that we added and subtracted 25 at the same time, so we didn’t change the equation:
$$0 = (x + 5)^2 + 45$$

We can now solve for $$x$$. First, move the 45 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides:
$$-45 = (x + 5)^2$$

Next, we need to take the square root of both sides. However, because we have a negative number on the left side, we can't find a real square root for it (we're only working with real numbers here). Mathematically, you can't have a real number whose square is negative.

So, since we can't get a real answer, there are no real roots for this equation. This means no real value of $$x$$ will make the original equation equal to 0.

If you were to learn about complex numbers in the future, things might be different, but for now, there are no real solutions.

And that’s it! We’ve used completing the square and found that the equation has no real roots. Great job!
