Hey there! Let's work on this problem together. The graph of $$y = |x|$$ is reflected across the $$x$$-axis and then stretched vertically by a factor of seven. Whatâ€™s the equation of the new graph? Take a moment to think about it, and then we'll go through it step-by-step.

Alright, let's dive in! To better understand, let's draw the graph. Imagine the $$x$$-axis and the $$y$$-axis on a piece of paper. The graph of $$y = |x|$$ looks like a "V" shape. For positive $$x$$ values, $$y$$ is just $$x$$ (e.g., when $$x = 1$$, $$y = 1$$; when $$x = 2$$, $$y = 2$$). For negative $$x$$ values, $$y$$ is the positive of $$x$$ (e.g., when $$x = -1$$, $$y = 1$$; when $$x = -2$$, $$y = 2$$).

Now, let's reflect the graph across the $$x$$-axis. Normally, for a given $$x$$, you take the absolute value. After reflecting, you take the negative of those values. So, if originally $$y = |x|$$, after reflection, it becomes $$y = -|x|$$.

Next, we stretch the graph vertically by a factor of seven. This means we multiply every value of $$y$$ by seven. Using our new equation from the reflection step, $$y = -|x|$$, we now multiply it by seven: $$y = -7|x|$$.

So, the new equation after reflecting and stretching is $$y = -7|x|$$.

Just to visualize: where $$y = |x|$$ had points like (1, 1) and (-1, 1), the new graph $$y = -7|x|$$ will move these points to (1, -7) and (-1, -7). The "V" shape is now flipped upside-down and stretched taller.

Remember, the negative sign flipped the graph over the $$x$$-axis, and the seven stretched it vertically.
