Hey there! Let's talk about this problem together. We're given the first four terms of a geometric sequence and need to find the fifth term. The first four terms are: 

- $$-\frac{1}{32}$$
- $$\frac{1}{8}$$
- $$-\frac{1}{2}$$
- $$2$$

And we need to figure out the fifth one. 

First, let's remember that in a geometric sequence, each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant number, known as the common ratio. 

Let's find the common ratio. To go from the first term, $$-\frac{1}{32}$$, to the second term, $$\frac{1}{8}$$, we need to multiply by a certain number. Since the second term is positive and the first term is negative, this number must be negative. 

So, how do we find this number? We can see that $$\frac{1}{8}$$ is 4 times as large as $$\frac{1}{32}$$. So, we multiply $$-\frac{1}{32}$$ by $$-4$$:

$$
-\frac{1}{32} \times -4 = \frac{1}{8}
$$

Let's check if this common ratio works for the other terms:

- To get from $$\frac{1}{8}$$ to $$-\frac{1}{2}$$:
$$
\frac{1}{8} \times -4 = -\frac{1}{2}
$$

- To get from $$-\frac{1}{2}$$ to $$2$$:
$$
-\frac{1}{2} \times -4 = 2
$$

It seems to hold true! So our common ratio is $$-4$$.

Now, let's use the common ratio to find the fifth term. We multiply the fourth term, $$2$$, by $$-4$$:

$$
2 \times -4 = -8
$$

So, the fifth term of the sequence is $$-8$$. 

Great job following along! Keep practicing, and you'll get even better at this.
