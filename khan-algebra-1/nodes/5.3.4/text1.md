Hey there! Let's work through this problem together.

Tara is going on a hike up a mountain. She starts at 1,200 meters above sea level and climbs at a steady pace. After hiking for 4 hours, she reaches an elevation of 1,700 meters. We need to make an equation that shows her elevation $$y$$ (in meters) after $$x$$ hours.

First, think about what we know:
- She starts at 1,200 meters.
- After 4 hours, she’s at 1,700 meters.
- She climbs at a constant rate, meaning she climbs the same amount each hour.

To find out how fast she's climbing, we calculate her change in elevation. She goes from 1,200 meters to 1,700 meters, so:
$$1700 - 1200 = 500$$ meters.

She climbs 500 meters in 4 hours, so her climbing rate is:
$$\frac{500 \text{ meters}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 125 \text{ meters per hour}$$.

Now we can use this rate to make our equation. She starts at 1,200 meters, so we take:
$$
y = 1200 + \text{(rate of climb)} \times \text{(number of hours)}
$$

Since the rate of climb is 125 meters per hour and the number of hours is $$x$$, our equation looks like this:
$$
y = 1200 + 125x
$$

This equation tells us Tara’s elevation (y) after x hours.

Another way to understand this is by using the slope-intercept form of a line, which is:
$$
y = mx + b
$$

Here, $$m$$ is the slope (how fast she climbs), and $$b$$ is the starting point (elevation when time is zero). For Tara:
- $$m$$ (slope) = 125 meters per hour
- $$b$$ (starting elevation) = 1200 meters

So, our equation can also be written as:
$$
y = 125x + 1200
$$

Both $$y = 1200 + 125x$$ and $$y = 125x + 1200$$ are the same thing; they just have the terms swapped.

Great job! Keep practicing, and you’ll get even better at these. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!
