Hey there! Today, I want to introduce you to something called an exponential function and show you just how fast it can grow. Let's take a look at an example to make this clear.

Imagine we have an exponential function like this: $$y = 3^x$$. Here, the independent variable, $$x$$, is the exponent, not the base. This means we are raising 3 to the power of $$x$$.

Let's make a table to see how quickly this function grows. We'll use these values of $$x$$: -4, -3, -2, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. And we'll find the corresponding $$y$$ values for each $$x$$.

- When $$x = -4$$, $$y = 3^{-4}$$, which is the same as $$\frac{1}{3^4} = \frac{1}{81}$$.
- When $$x = -3$$, $$y = 3^{-3}$$, which is $$\frac{1}{3^3} = \frac{1}{27}$$.
- When $$x = -2$$, $$y = 3^{-2}$$, which is $$\frac{1}{3^2} = \frac{1}{9}$$.
- When $$x = 0$$, $$y = 3^0$$, which is 1.
- When $$x = 1$$, $$y = 3^1$$, which is 3.
- When $$x = 2$$, $$y = 3^2$$, which is 9.
- When $$x = 3$$, $$y = 3^3$$, which is 27.
- When $$x = 4$$, $$y = 3^4$$, which is 81.

Let's plot these points on a graph to see the growth more clearly. We'll draw the $$x$$-axis and the $$y$$-axis.

For positive values of $$x$$, the graph will show an increasing curve:
- At $$x = 0$$, $$y = 1$$.
- At $$x = 1$$, $$y = 3$$.
- At $$x = 2$$, $$y = 9$$.
- At $$x = 3$$, $$y = 27$$.
- At $$x = 4$$, $$y = 81$$.

Notice how the function grows very quickly as $$x$$ increases. For negative values of $$x$$:
- At $$x = -1$$, $$y = \frac{1}{3}$$.
- At $$x = -2$$, $$y = \frac{1}{9}$$.
- As $$x$$ becomes more negative, $$y$$ gets closer and closer to zero, but never quite reaches it.

So, exponential functions grow really, really fast. Now, let's look at a fun example involving a chain letter to understand the power of exponential growth in real life.

Suppose in week 1, someone sends a chain letter to 10 people. Each of these 10 people agree to send the letter to 10 more people the next week:
- In week 2, 100 people get the letter.
- In week 3, 1,000 people get the letter.

If we keep this pattern going, in week $$n$$, the number of people who receive the letter is $$10^n$$. So:
- In week 6, $$10^6 = 1,000,000$$ people.
- In week 9, $$10^9 = 1,000,000,000$$ people.

As you can see, the number quickly becomes huge, demonstrating the dramatic growth of exponential functions.

That's it for now! See you in the next lesson.
