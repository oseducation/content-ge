Hey there! We have a really tricky expression here, probably the toughest one we've seen yet! But let’s see if we can simplify it together. It’s got a mix of $$y$$'s, $$xy$$'s, $$x^2$$'s, and more. It might be tempting to combine $$-3y$$ with $$4xy$$ just because they both have a $$y$$. But remember, $$y$$ is different from $$xy$$. Think of $$x$$ and $$y$$ as numbers—if $$y = 3$$ and $$x = 2$$, then $$y$$ is 3 and $$xy$$ is 6, which are very different from each other. Similarly, $$y$$ is different from $$y^2$$. If $$y = 3$$, then $$y^2 = 9$$.

So, you can’t add or subtract terms like $$y$$ and $$xy$$, or $$y$$ and $$y^2$$, because they are not the same. Now, let’s see what we can simplify. 

First, look at the $$y$$ terms:
- We have $$-3y$$ and $$2y$$.
So we can write it as:
$$-3y + 2y$$.

Now, let’s look at the $$xy$$ terms:
- We have $$4xy$$ and $$-4xy$$.
So we can write it as:
$$+4xy - 4xy$$.

Next are the $$x^2$$ terms:
- We have $$-2x^2$$ and $$3x^2$$.
So we can write it as:
$$-2x^2 + 3x^2$$.

Then, there's one lone $$x$$ term:
- We have $$+2x$$.

Finally, we have a $$y^2$$ term:
- We have $$+y^2$$.

Let's reorder everything based on term type:
$$(-3y + 2y) + (4xy - 4xy) + (-2x^2 + 3x^2) + 2x + y^2$$.

Now, simplifying each group:
- For $$-3y + 2y$$, if you have 2 and take away 3, you are left with $$-1y$$ or simply $$-y$$.
- For $$4xy - 4xy$$, if you have 4 and take away 4, you’re left with 0. So, they cancel out.
- For $$-2x^2 + 3x^2$$, if you have 3 and take away 2, you’re left with $$1x^2$$ or simply $$x^2$$.
- The $$+2x$$ term remains as is.
- The $$+y^2$$ term also remains as is.

So, putting it all together, the simplified expression is:
$$-y + x^2 + 2x + y^2$$.

That’s it! You might arrange the terms in a different order, but as long as the simplified terms are correct, it’s all good. Great job!
