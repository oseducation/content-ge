Sure, let's go through this step by step and keep it simple!

We've got a problem to solve:

$$4x^2 + 40x - 300 = 0$$

First, let's rewrite it:

$$4x^2 + 40x - 300 = 0$$

I don't like having that 4 in front of $$x^2$$ because it makes things complicated. So, let's divide everything by 4 to make it simpler:

$$\frac{4x^2}{4} + \frac{40x}{4} - \frac{300}{4} = \frac{0}{4}$$

This simplifies to:

$$x^2 + 10x - 75 = 0$$

When you do the same operation on both sides, the equation stays balanced, like a scale.

Now, I notice that $$x^2 + 10x - 75$$ is not easy to factor directly. So, we need to "complete the square." Let's move the 75 to the right side:

$$x^2 + 10x = 75$$

Now hereâ€™s the important part: we need to add a number to both sides to make the left side a perfect square. To do this, take half of the 10, which is 5, and square it, which is 25. Add this number to both sides:

$$x^2 + 10x + 25 = 75 + 25$$

Now, the left side becomes a perfect square:

$$(x + 5)^2 = 100$$

So, we now have:

$$(something)^2 = 100$$

This means the something could be either positive or negative 10 because both $$10^2$$ and $$(-10)^2$$ equal 100. Let's write that down:

$$x + 5 = \pm 10$$

This gives us two equations to solve:

1. $$x + 5 = 10$$
2. $$x + 5 = -10$$

For the first equation:

$$x + 5 = 10$$

Subtract 5 from both sides:

$$x = 10 - 5$$

$$x = 5$$

For the second equation:

$$x + 5 = -10$$

Subtract 5 from both sides:

$$x = -10 - 5$$

$$x = -15$$

So, the solutions are:

$$x = 5 \text{ or } x = -15$$

Let's check one solution to make sure it works. We'll check $$x = 5$$:

$$4(5)^2 + 40(5) - 300 = 0$$

$$4 \times 25 + 200 - 300 = 0$$

$$100 + 200 - 300 = 0$$

$$0 = 0$$

It works! You can also check $$x = -15$$ to see it works too.

And that's how we solve the equation by completing the square!
