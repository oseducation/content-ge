Sure! Let's break it down step by step together.

So, we need to write an inequality that matches the graph below. The graph has a solid red line, which means our inequality should include this line. The entire area above the line is shaded, so $$y$$ is greater than or equal to something.

First, we need to find the equation of the line. We see its $$y$$-intercept clearly. The $$y$$-intercept is at $$y = -2$$, which is the point $$(0, -2)$$.

Next, we think about the equation of the line in the form $$y = mx + b$$. We already know that $$b = -2$$.

Now, let's figure out the slope, $$m$$. If we move 2 units right in the $$x$$-direction ($$\Delta x = 2$$), the change in $$y$$ ($$\Delta y$$) is -1. So, the slope $$m$$ is:

$$
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-1}{2}
$$

This gives us the equation of the line:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}x - 2
$$

Since the inequality includes everything above this line, we write:

$$
y \geq -\frac{1}{2}x - 2
$$

This means for any $$x$$ value, $$y$$ is either on the line or above it. For example, if $$x = 2$$, we plug it into the line equation:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}(2) - 2 = -1 - 2 = -3
$$

So, for $$x = 2$$, $$y$$ can be -3 or any value above -3. 

Therefore, the inequality that fits the graph is:

$$
y \geq -\frac{1}{2}x - 2
$$

This inequality shows the line and everything above it. Great job!
