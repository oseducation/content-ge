Sure! Let's chat about this in a simpler way! So, we have a function $$g$$ that we can think of as a moved version of $$f(x) = x^2$$. Our job is to write the equation for $$g(x)$$. 

First, when we move a function, especially a U-shaped graph like a parabola, we can look at its most distinctive point, which is called the vertex. 

For $$f(x) = x^2$$, the vertex is at (0,0). If we move this point to the right by 3 and down by 4, we would make the vertex of $$f$$ sit on the vertex of $$g$$. This would likely make the entire graph of $$f$$ look like $$g$$. Cool, right?

So, how do we move the graph to the right by 3? We replace $$x$$ with $$(x - 3)$$. Why? Because we want the same value at the new point that we had at the old point. For example, we want the value at $$x = 3$$ to be the same as the value at $$x = 0$$ before we moved it.

When we replaced $$x$$ with $$(x - 3)$$ in $$f(x)$$, we get:
$$y = (x - 3)^2$$

This makes the whole curve move to the right by 3 units.

Next, let's move the graph down by 4. We subtract 4 from the whole function. So, the equation becomes:
$$y = (x - 3)^2 - 4$$

This means for every point on our new curve, the value is 4 less than it would be if we hadn't moved it down.

So, the final equation for $$g(x)$$ is:
$$g(x) = (x - 3)^2 - 4$$

To summarize:
- Replace $$x$$ with $$(x - 3)$$ to shift right by 3.
- Subtract 4 to shift down by 4.

And that's it! Youâ€™ve got your new function $$g(x)$$!
