Sure, let's go through this together!

Hey! Let's talk about finding the high and low points on a graph, known as extremum points. These are places where the graph reaches a peak or a valley relative to the points around them.

There are two main types of extremum points:

1. **Relative Maximum**: This is like the top of a hill. It doesn't have to be the highest point on the entire graph, just the highest point in its immediate area.
2. **Relative Minimum**: This is like the bottom of a valley. Again, it doesn't have to be the lowest point on the entire graph, just the lowest point in its immediate area.

Sometimes, you might also see flat parts of the graph. These can be both a relative maximum and a relative minimum because they are neither higher nor lower than the points around them.

Let's identify these points together on the graph:

- **Relative Maximum Points**: Look for the tops of hills. If the graph goes higher to the left or right, it's not a relative maximum. 
- **Relative Minimum Points**: Look for the bottoms of valleys. If the graph goes lower to the left or right, it's not a relative minimum.

Now, let's move on to absolute extrema:

- **Absolute Maximum and Minimum Points**: These are the highest and lowest points on the entire graph. 

An absolute maximum at $$x = c$$ occurs if $$f(c) \geq f(x)$$ for all $$x$$ in the graph.
An absolute minimum at $$x = c$$ occurs if $$f(c) \leq f(x)$$ for all $$x$$ in the graph.

To identify these on the graph:
- The **absolute maximum** is the single highest point.
- The **absolute minimum** is the single lowest point.

Sometimes, the graph may be flat for a bit. Any point in this flat region can be considered an absolute maximum if they are the highest points on the graph.

In most problems, itâ€™s pretty straightforward. Just look for the highest and lowest points on the entire curve.

I hope this helps! Feel free to ask if you have more questions.
