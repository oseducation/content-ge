Sure, let's break this down together!

We're asked to simplify or expand $$(7x + 10)^2.$$ The first thing I need to tell you is what NOT to do. A lot of people might look at this and think, "Oh, that's $$ (7x)^2 + 10^2 $$. This is WRONG. And I'll say it loudly: THIS IS WRONG!

Your brain might be thinking if you had $$ 7x \times 10 $$ and squared that, it would be $$ (7x)^2 \times 10^2 $$. But that's not what we're doing here. We're adding $$ 7x $$ to $$ 10 $$, so you can't just square each term like that. 

To see why it's wrong, remember that $$ (7x + 10)^2 $$ means the same as $$ (7x + 10)(7x + 10)$$. When we square something, we're multiplying it by itself. So, we're really multiplying two binomials (two terms), which just happen to be the same here. 

There are a few methods to do this like using F.O.I.L. (First, Outer, Inner, Last) or the distributive property, but this case is special because we're squaring a binomial. 

Let's look at this special case: 

If you have $$(a + b)^2,$$ it is NOT the same as $$a^2 + b^2$$. Instead, it's $$ (a + b)(a + b)$$. Using the distributive property, we multiply $$a + b$$ by $$a$$ and then by $$b$$.

So, we get:
$$a(a + b) + b(a + b)$$

Distribute each term:
$$a \cdot a + a \cdot b + b \cdot a + b \cdot b$$

This simplifies to:
$$a^2 + ab + ab + b^2$$

The $$ ab $$ and $$ ab $$ are like terms, so we combine them:
$$a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$

So the pattern here is if you have $$(a + b)^2,$$ it's equal to $$a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$.

Now applying this to our problem with $$(7x + 10)^2$$:

This is equal to:
$$ (7x)^2 + 2 \cdot 7x \cdot 10 + 10^2 $$

Let's simplify:
- $$(7x)^2 = 49x^2$$ because $$7^2 = 49$$ and $$x^2$$ is just $$x^2$$.
- $$2 \cdot 7x \cdot 10 = 140x$$
- $$10^2 = 100$$

So, putting it all together we get:
$$49x^2 + 140x + 100$$

And that's the answer! The key difference between doing it the right way and the wrong way is recognizing that extra middle term, $$2ab$$, which you might forget if you just squared $$7x$$ and $$10$$ separately.
