Hey there! Let's work through this problem together to find the 100th term of the given sequence. The sequence we have is 15, 9, 3, -3, and so on.

First, let's list out some terms to see what's happening:
1. The first term is 15.
2. The second term is 9.
3. The third term is 3.
4. The fourth term is -3.

We want to figure out the 100th term in this sequence. To find this, let's identify the pattern:
- From 15 to 9, we subtract 6.
- From 9 to 3, we subtract 6 again.
- From 3 to -3, we subtract 6 once more.

So, each term is 6 less than the previous term. This means we can write it as:
$$ \text{Term}_{n} = \text{First term} - (n-1) \times 6 $$

Here's how we break it down:
- The 1st term is: $$ 15 - 0 \times 6 = 15 $$
- The 2nd term is: $$ 15 - 1 \times 6 = 15 - 6 = 9 $$
- The 3rd term is: $$ 15 - 2 \times 6 = 15 - 12 = 3 $$
- The 4th term is: $$ 15 - 3 \times 6 = 15 - 18 = -3 $$

Now, to find the 100th term:
$$ \text{Term}_{100} = 15 - (100-1) \times 6 $$
$$ \text{Term}_{100} = 15 - 99 \times 6 $$
$$ \text{Term}_{100} = 15 - 594 $$

Together, let's calculate:
$$ 15 - 594 = -579 $$

So, the 100th term in the sequence is $$ -579 $$.

Great job! Feel free to ask more questions if you need further clarification. Keep up the good work!
