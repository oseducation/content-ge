Sure thing! Let me simplify that for you.

Alright, so let's break this down together. We're told that a phone sells for $600 and loses 25% of its value each year. We need to write a function that shows the phone's value ($$V(t)$$) after $$t$$ years.

First, think about it step by step. How much is the phone worth at the start (when $$t = 0$$)? Well, it's worth $600. So, $$V(0) = 600$$.

Now, after one year ($$t = 1$$), the phone loses 25% of its value. This means it keeps 75% of its value. So after one year, its value is:
$$600 \times 0.75$$.

After two years ($$t = 2$$), it keeps 75% of its value from the first year. So its value is:
$$600 \times 0.75 \times 0.75 = 600 \times 0.75^2$$.

In general, after $$t$$ years, the value of the phone is:
$$V(t) = 600 \times 0.75^t$$.

And that’s it! We’ve written the function for the phone’s value after $$t$$ years.

Now, let’s do another example. A biologist has a sample of 6,000 cells, and a virus kills 1/3 of the cells every week. We need to write a function that shows the number of cells ($$C(t)$$) after $$t$$ weeks.

Let’s take it step by step. How many cells are there at the start (when $$t = 0$$)? We have 6,000 cells, so $$C(0) = 6000$$.

After one week ($$t = 1$$), the virus kills 1/3 of the cells, meaning 2/3 of the cells are left. So after one week, the number of cells is:
$$6000 \times \frac{2}{3}$$.

After two weeks ($$t = 2$$), we have 2/3 of the cells left from the first week. So the number of cells is:
$$6000 \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = 6000 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2$$.

In general, after $$t$$ weeks, the number of cells is:
$$C(t) = 6000 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^t$$.

And there we go! We’ve written the function for the number of cells after $$t$$ weeks.
