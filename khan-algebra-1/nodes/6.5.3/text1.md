Sure! Let's chat about this Math problem and figure it out together.

---

You have two linear equations:
1. $$x + 2y = 13$$
2. $$3x - y = -11$$

We want to know if this system is consistent or inconsistent.

### What Does Consistent or Inconsistent Mean?

- **Consistent**: The system has at least one solution.
- **Inconsistent**: The system has no solutions.

Think about it like this â€” if you draw these two lines on a graph:
- **Consistent System**: The lines either cross at one point (one solution) or are the same line (infinite solutions).
- **Inconsistent System**: The lines are parallel and never touch.

### Drawing it Out

Let's make a quick and rough graph. 

1. Draw the x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical).

#### For the first equation $$x + 2y = 13$$:
- When $$x = 0$$: $$2y = 13 \Rightarrow y = 6.5$$. Point (0, 6.5)
- When $$y = 0$$: $$x = 13$$. Point (13, 0)

Draw a line through these points.

#### For the second equation $$3x - y = -11$$:
- When $$x = 0$$: $$-y = -11 \Rightarrow y = 11$$. Point (0, 11)
- When $$y = 0$$: $$3x = -11 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{11}{3} \approx -3.67$$. Point (-3.67, 0)

Draw a line through these points.

### Do the Lines Cross?

If the lines cross each other, we have a consistent system. By looking at our rough graph, we can see that these lines do intersect.

### Conclusion

Since these two lines intersect, the system is **consistent**. This means there is at least one solution.

Keep practicing, and graphing these lines can become second nature! You did great!
