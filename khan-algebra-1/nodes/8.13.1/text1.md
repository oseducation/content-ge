Hey there! Let's chat a bit about functions and their inverses. First, let's get a simple function to work with. Imagine we have a function $$f(x) = 2x + 4$$. 

If we want to know what $$f(2)$$ is, we simply plug 2 into the function:

$$f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8$$.

We can do the same for another number, say 3:

$$f(3) = 2 \cdot 3 + 4 = 10$$.

Great! Now, let's think about the terms "domain" and "range." The domain is the set of all possible inputs you can put into the function, which in this case can be any real number. The range is all the possible values you can get out of the function.

So, if you input 2 into the function $$f(x)$$, you get 8 out. We say the function maps 2 to 8. 

Now, let's explore an interesting question: Can we go backwards? Is there a way to get from 8 back to 2? Is there something like a reverse function that could take us from 10 back to 3? This reverse function is called the inverse of the original function, and we write it as $$f^{-1}$$.

To find the inverse, let's start by setting $$y = f(x)$$, so:

$$y = 2x + 4$$.

Next, we want to solve for $$x$$ in terms of $$y$$. Let's do that step by step:

1. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   $$y - 4 = 2x$$.

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   $$\frac{y - 4}{2} = x$$.

So, we have:

$$x = \frac{y - 4}{2}$$.

If we rewrite it in terms of a function of $$y$$, it becomes:

$$f^{-1}(y) = \frac{y - 4}{2}$$.

So, the inverse function $$f^{-1}(x)$$ takes an output of the original function and gives us back the input. For example, if we plug 8 into the inverse function:

$$f^{-1}(8) = \frac{8 - 4}{2} = 2$$.

Now, let's graph these functions to see their relationship. The original function $$f(x) = 2x + 4$$ has a y-intercept of 4 and a slope of 2. The inverse function $$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{x - 4}{2}$$ has a y-intercept of -2 and a slope of $$\frac{1}{2}$$.

When you graph both on a coordinate plane, you'll notice they are reflections of each other across the line $$y = x$$. This means for any point $$(a, b)$$ on the graph of $$f(x)$$, there's a matching point $$(b, a)$$ on $$f^{-1}(x)$$. 

For example, $$f(0) = 4$$ maps 0 to 4 on the original function, and $$f^{-1}(4) = 0$$ maps 4 back to 0 on the inverse function. 

I hope this makes sense! In the next sessions, we'll go through several more examples to get a solid grip on finding and using inverses. You're doing greatâ€”keep it up!
