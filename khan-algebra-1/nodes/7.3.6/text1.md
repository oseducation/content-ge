Sure, let's break this down step by step and see if Fleur has enough materials. 

Fleur wants to make tables and chairs. Each item uses a certain number of wooden boards and nails. She has 150 wooden boards and 330 nails. Here's the situation:

To represent the number of tables ($$T$$) and chairs ($$C$$) she can make with the boards, we have this inequality:
$$ 17T + 6C \leq 150 $$
where $$17$$ is the number of wooden boards for each table, and $$6$$ is the number of wooden boards for each chair.

Similarly, for the nails, the inequality is:
$$ 34T + 27C \leq 330 $$
where $$34$$ is the number of nails for each table, and $$27$$ is the number of nails for each chair.

Now, let's see if she can make 3 tables and 9 chairs with the materials she has.

First, let's check the wooden boards:
To make 3 tables: $$17 \times 3 = 51$$ boards
To make 9 chairs: $$6 \times 9 = 54$$ boards
So, she needs a total of:
$$ 51 + 54 = 105 $$ boards
Since $$ 105 \leq 150 $$, she has enough wooden boards.

Next, let's check the nails:
To make 3 tables: $$34 \times 3 = 102$$ nails
To make 9 chairs: $$27 \times 9 = 243$$ nails
So, she needs a total of:
$$ 102 + 243 = 345 $$ nails
Since $$ 345 \nleq 330 $$, she does not have enough nails.

So, Fleur has enough wooden boards but not enough nails to make 3 tables and 9 chairs. She will need to buy more nails if she wants to complete these tables and chairs.
