Alright, let's choose the right graph for this function. The function is $f(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$, and we have three graphs to pick from. Pause for a moment and see if you can figure out which graph shows $f(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$. Let's work through this together.

This type of function is called an exponential function because we're multiplying by a number raised to a power. When dealing with exponential functions, I like to think about two things: what happens when $x = 0$ and how the function grows.

First, let's see what $f(x)$ is when $x = 0$. Using the function $f(x) = 2 \cdot 3^0$, we get $3^0 = 1$ so $2 \cdot 1 = 2$. This means $y = 2$ when $x = 0$. This point, $(0, 2)$, is where the graph crosses the y-axis. This is also known as the y-intercept.

Let’s identify the graphs with the correct y-intercept. One graph has a y-intercept of 1, another has a y-intercept of 3, and the last one has a y-intercept of 2. So, the third graph is the potential right choice based on the y-intercept alone. But let's keep going to confirm.

Next, let’s talk about the common ratio, which here is 3. This means the function’s value triples every time $x$ increases by 1. For example, $f(1) = 2 \cdot 3^1 = 6$. And $f(2) = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18$. 

To confirm our choice, we check if the graph increases by multiplying by 3 each time. The first graph has a y-intercept of 1 and goes to 3 when $x = 1$, then to 9, showing it triples, but starts at 1 instead of 2. The second graph starts at 3 and doubles each time, fitting $y = 3 \cdot 2^x$ rather than our function. 

The third graph starts at 2. At $x = 1$, $y$ is 6; at $x = 2$, $y$ is 18, tripling each time. We can also check by going down: $2 \div 3 \approx 0.67$, showing this function works both up and down the number line.

So, we can feel very good choosing the third graph for $f(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$.
