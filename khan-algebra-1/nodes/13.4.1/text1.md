Hey there! Let's talk about factors. You're probably familiar with the basic idea of what a factor is. For example, if I asked you what the factors of 12 are, you might think, which whole numbers can be multiplied together to get 12?

So, you might say: 
- $$1 \times 12 = 12$$, which makes 1 and 12 both factors of 12.
- $$2 \times 6 = 12$$, which makes 2 and 6 both factors of 12.
- $$3 \times 4 = 12$$, which makes 3 and 4 both factors of 12.

So, all the factors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Also, you could say it in another way. For example, for the number 3, you could say that 3 is a factor of 12, or that 12 is divisible by 3.

Now, let's extend this idea into the world of algebra. Suppose we have the expression $$3xy$$, and we multiply it by another expression like $$-2x^2y^3$$. What does that equal?

When we multiply the numbers (coefficients), $$3 \times -2 = -6$$. Then, for the variables:
- $$x \times x^2 = x^3$$ (since you add the exponents)
- $$y \times y^3 = y^4$$ (again, adding the exponents)

So, the result is $$-6x^3y^4$$. From this, we can say that $$3xy$$ is a factor of $$-6x^3y^4$$, or that $$-6x^3y^4$$ is divisible by $$3xy$$.

We can also apply this idea to more complex expressions like binomials or polynomials. For example, let's take $$(x + 3)$$ and multiply it by $$(x + 7)$$. When we do this step-by-step, we get:
- $$x \times x = x^2$$
- Then, $$3x + 7x = 10x$$
- Finally, $$3 \times 7 = 21$$

So, $$(x + 3)(x + 7) = x^2 + 10x + 21$$. Here, both $$(x + 3)$$ and $$(x + 7)$$ are factors of $$x^2 + 10x + 21$$, or you could say that $$x^2 + 10x + 21$$ is divisible by either $$(x + 3)$$ or $$(x + 7)$$.

The key thing to notice is that the numbers involved (coefficients) are integersâ€”whole numbers, which makes the idea of divisibility and factors work just like with simple numbers.

Does that make sense? Feel free to ask if you have any questions!
