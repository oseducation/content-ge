Hey there! I just got this drug calculation problem from a nursing student, and I think it's really important for nursing students to understand this, especially if I'm the patient getting the drug. Let's work through it together. It's also a great exercise for anyone wanting to practice unit conversion. Hereâ€™s the problem:

A doctor orders a drug, let's call it drug X. The dosage ordered is 5 milligrams per pound of the patient's weight, every 12 hours. But we have the drug in a solution form, where we know there are 0.9 grams per milliliter of the solution. The patient weighs 72.7 kilograms. The question is: How many milliliters of the solution do we need to give to the patient per dose?

Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Convert Kilograms to Pounds:**
   We need to convert the patient's weight from kilograms to pounds because the dosage is given in milligrams per pound. We know that:

   $$
   1 \, \text{kilogram} \approx 2.2 \, \text{pounds}
   $$

   So,

   $$ 
   72.7 \, \text{kilograms} \times 2.2 \, \text{pounds/kilogram} = 159.94 \, \text{pounds}
   $$

2. **Calculate Dosage in Milligrams:**
   The dosage is 5 milligrams per pound. Therefore,

   $$ 
   159.94 \, \text{pounds} \times 5 \, \text{milligrams/pound} = 799.7 \, \text{milligrams}
   $$

3. **Convert Milligrams to Grams:**
   Since the drug concentration is given in grams per milliliter, we convert milligrams to grams:

   $$ 
   1 \, \text{gram} = 1000 \, \text{milligrams}
   $$ 

   So,

   $$ 
   799.7 \, \text{milligrams} \div 1000 = 0.7997 \, \text{grams}
   $$

4. **Calculate Milliliters of Solution:**
   Now, we need to find out how many milliliters of solution contain 0.7997 grams of the drug. Given that the solution has 0.9 grams per milliliter, we can set up the calculation:

   $$ 
   0.7997 \, \text{grams} \div 0.9 \, \text{grams/milliliter} = 0.888 \, \text{milliliters}
   $$

So, the amount of solution needed per dose is:

$$
0.888 \, \text{milliliters}
$$

That's it! Every 12 hours, the patient should receive around 0.889 milliliters of the solution. If you need to know the total over two days (48 hours), you would multiply this by 4 doses (because 48 divided by 12 is 4). But for now, we've got it figured out for one dose.

I hope this helps make things clearer, and good luck with your studies! ðŸ˜Š
