Hey there! Let's solve the inequality to find out what $$x$$ should be. We have:

$$5x + 7 > 3(x + 1)$$

First, let's simplify the right side to make things easier. We'll distribute the $$3$$:

$$5x + 7 > 3x + 3 \cdot 1$$ which is $$3x + 3$$

Next, we want all the $$x$$ terms on one side. Let's subtract $$3x$$ from both sides:

$$5x - 3x + 7 > 3x - 3x + 3$$

This simplifies to:

$$2x + 7 > 3$$

Now, let's get rid of the $$7$$ by subtracting $$7$$ from both sides:

$$2x + 7 - 7 > 3 - 7$$

So, we have:

$$2x > -4$$

To solve for $$x$$, divide both sides by $$2$$. Since $$2$$ is positive, we don't need to change the inequality sign:

$$x > -4 / 2$$ which is $$x > -2$$

Great! So the solution is $$x > -2$$. On a number line, this means all values greater than $$-2$$. We draw an open circle at $$-2$$ to show that $$-2$$ itself is not included, and shade the line to the right.

Let's double-check by testing some values. 

Try $$0$$ (which is greater than $$-2$$):

$$5 \cdot 0 + 7 > 3 \cdot 0 + 1$$
$$7 > 3$$

That's true!

Now try $$-3$$ (which is not greater than $$-2$$):

$$5 \cdot (-3) + 7 > 3 \cdot (-3) + 1$$
$$-15 + 7 > -9 + 1$$
$$-8 > -6$$

This is false because $$-8$$ is less than $$-6$$.

Our solution $$x > -2$$ is correct. The inequality holds for values greater than $$-2$$, and doesn't hold for values less than or equal to $$-2$$. Well done!
