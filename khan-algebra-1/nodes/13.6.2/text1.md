Sure! Let's break it down step by step together.

We're asked to factor $$4y^2 + 4y - 15$$. When you have an expression like this with a non-one number in front of the $$y^2$$ term (or the squared term), the best way is to use grouping.

To factor by grouping, we need to find two numbers whose product is equal to $$4 \times (-15)$$, which is $$-60$$. Let's call these numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$. So, the product of $$a$$ and $$b$$ should be $$-60$$, and their sum should be $$4$$.

Let's think about all the factors of $$60$$. Since the product is negative, this means one number has to be negative and the other positive. And their sum should be $$4$$. We'll look for pairs that are 4 apart:

- Try $$5$$ and $$-12$$. Their sum is $$-7$$.
- Try $$-5$$ and $$12$$. Their sum is $$7$$.
- Try $$6$$ and $$-10$$. Their sum is $$-4$$.
- Try $$-6$$ and $$10$$. Their sum is $$4$$. Bingo!

So, we will use $$-6$$ and $$10$$. 

Next, we use these numbers to break up the middle term, $$4y$$, into $$-6y$$ and $$10y$$. This turns our expression into:
$$4y^2 - 6y + 10y - 15$$.

Now we group the terms:
$$(4y^2 - 6y) + (10y - 15)$$.

For the first group $$(4y^2 - 6y)$$, we can factor out $$2y$$:
$$2y(2y - 3)$$.

For the second group $$(10y - 15)$$, we can factor out $$5$$:
$$5(2y - 3)$$.

Now we have:
$$2y(2y - 3) + 5(2y - 3)$$.

Notice $$2y - 3$$ is common in both terms, so we can factor it out:
$$(2y - 3)(2y + 5)$$.

And that's it! We've factored $$4y^2 + 4y - 15$$ into $$(2y - 3)(2y + 5)$$.
