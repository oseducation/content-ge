Hey there! Let's have a look at the table given. We're asked whether the information shows a functional relationship between each person and their height.

First, let's think about what a functional relationship means. We know there's definitely a relationship. For example, they tell us:

- Joelle is 5-6
- Nathan is 4-11
- Stewart is 5-11

That's a clear relationship. But for it to be a functional relationship, each person's name (the independent variable) must be tied to only one height (the dependent variable). 

So, if this is a height function, no matter whose name you put into the function, you should get only one height back. If there were two different heights for one person’s name, it wouldn’t be a functional relationship.

For instance, if I asked, "What is Nathan’s height?" You would look at the table and say Nathan is 4-11. There aren’t two heights for Nathan, just one. It’s the same for all other people in the table. Each person has just one height, so it is a functional relationship.

Now, let's plot this to see it visually. The highest height here is 6-1. If we plot using names as inputs (x-axis) and height in feet as outputs (y-axis):

- Joelle = 5-6
- Nathan = 4-11
- Stewart = 5-11
- LJ = 5-6
- Tariq = 6-1

Let’s plot these points:
- Joelle at 5-6
- Nathan at 4-11
- Stewart close to 6 feet, at 5-11
- LJ at 5-6, same as Joelle, which is fine since each person has just one height
- Tariq at 6-1

This shows that for each person (input), we have exactly one height (output), proving it is a functional relationship.

Now, consider if the table also included Stewart as 5-3 along with 5-11. This would mean Stewart has two heights. Graphically, Stewart would appear twice at different heights:

- 5-11 and 5-3

So, there would be two outputs for Stewart, which isn’t allowed in a functional relationship. You wouldn't know Stewart's true height (5-3 or 5-11) anymore. 

Since our original table does not contain this conflicting information, Stewart has one height (5-11), and thus, our relationship is functional.

Summing up, a functional relationship means each input (person) must have exactly one output (height). If one person had two heights, it wouldn’t be a function. The idea seems simple but is very important for functions!
