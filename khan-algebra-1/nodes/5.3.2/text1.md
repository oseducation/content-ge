Sure, let's break it down together and make it easy to understand!

So, we have a line with a slope of $$-\frac{3}{4}$$ and it goes through the point (0, 8). Our goal is to find the equation of this line in slope-intercept form. 

Slope-intercept form is written as:
$$ y = mx + b $$

Here:
- $$m$$ is the slope of the line.
- $$b$$ is the y-intercept, which is where the line crosses the y-axis.

Let's visualize it first. Here’s a quick sketch:
- We have a y-axis and an x-axis.
- Since our slope is negative, our line will slope downwards.

The slope ($$m$$) shows us how much we go up or down (rise) for every step we take to the right (run). It's given by $$ \text{slope} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} $$.

For our line:
- The slope is $$-\frac{3}{4}$$. 
- This means for every 4 steps to the right (positive x direction), we go down 3 steps (negative y direction).

Next, let’s talk about the y-intercept ($$b$$). This is where the line crosses the y-axis, and it’s the value of $$y$$ when $$x$$ is 0. 

We know:
- The line goes through the point (0, 8). 
- So, when $$x$$ is 0, $$y$$ is 8. 
- Hence, the y-intercept $$b$$ is 8.

Now, we have everything we need to write our line’s equation in slope-intercept form:
- The slope $$m$$ is $$-\frac{3}{4}$$
- The y-intercept $$b$$ is 8.

So, plugging these values into the equation $$ y = mx + b $$, we get:
$$ y = -\frac{3}{4}x + 8 $$

And there you go! That’s the equation of our line. 

Hope this makes it clear! Feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
