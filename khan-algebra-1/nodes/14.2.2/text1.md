Hey there! We're going to draw the graph of the equation $$y = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (x - 6) \cdot (x + 2)$$. Before we start, you might want to pause and try to graph it yourself using some graph paper or even just a regular sheet of paper.

Alright, let's work through this together. One way to draw the graph is to pick a bunch of $$x$$ values, find their corresponding $$y$$ values, and connect the dots. But we can find the key points without too much work.

First, let's notice something: If we multiply out $$(x - 6) \cdot (x + 2)$$, we'll get $$x^2$$ plus some other terms, which makes this a quadratic equation. You might remember that the graph of a quadratic equation is a U-shaped curve called a parabola.

Parabolas can cross the x-axis at several points. Let's figure out where this one does. We need to find where $$y$$ is zero, because that's where the graph intersects the x-axis. Our equation is already factored, which makes this easier.

To find out when $$y = 0$$, we need to solve the equation $$\frac{1}{2} \cdot (x - 6) \cdot (x + 2) = 0$$. The only way for a product to be zero is if one of the factors is zero. So we solve:
- $$x - 6 = 0$$, which means $$x = 6$$.
- $$x + 2 = 0$$, which means $$x = -2$$.

These are our x-values where $$y$$ equals zero: $$x = 6$$ and $$x = -2$$. So our graph crosses the x-axis at these points.

Next, let's find the vertex of our parabola. The vertex is halfway between our two x-intercepts. The midpoint between $$-2$$ and $$6$$ is found by averaging them:
$$\frac{-2 + 6}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$$.

So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $$2$$. Now we need the y-coordinate. We substitute $$x = 2$$ back into the original equation:
$$y = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (2 - 6) \cdot (2 + 2)$$
$$y = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-4) \cdot (4)$$
$$y = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-16)$$
$$y = -8$$

So, the vertex of our parabola is at $$(2, -8)$$.

Now we can sketch the parabola. It will cross the x-axis at $$x = -2$$ and $$x = 6$$, and its lowest point (since it opens upwards) is at $$(2, -8)$$. Here's a rough hand-drawn sketch:

The graph will look something like a U-shaped curve that is symmetric around the line $$x = 2$$, and it will pass through $$(6, 0)$$, $$(2, -8)$$, and $$(-2, 0)$$.
