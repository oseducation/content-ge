Hey there! Let's work through some examples together on how to handle exponents, especially when we’re working with whole number exponents.

Imagine you have $$3^{-8} \times 7^3$$ and you need to raise that whole expression to the $$-2$$ power. Try to simplify this on your own first!

The key thing to remember here is that when you're raising a product of numbers to an exponent, you can raise each number to that exponent separately and then take the product. So:

$$
(3^{-8} \times 7^3)^{-2}
$$

is the same as:

$$
3^{-8 \cdot (-2)} \times 7^{3 \cdot (-2)}
$$

When you simplify it:

$$
3^{-8 \cdot (-2)} = 3^{16}
$$

and:

$$
7^{3 \cdot (-2)} = 7^{-6}
$$

So the simplified form is:

$$
3^{16} \times 7^{-6}
$$

Now, you can also write $$7^{-6}$$ as a fraction:

$$
3^{16} \times \frac{1}{7^6}
$$

which is the same as:

$$
\frac{3^{16}}{7^6}
$$

Let’s practice another one. Suppose you have $$a^{-2} \times 8^7$$ and you need to raise all of that to the $$2$$ power. Here’s how you do it:

$$
(a^{-2} \times 8^7)^2 = (a^{-2})^2 \times (8^7)^2
$$

Simplifying it:

$$
a^{-2 \cdot 2} = a^{-4}
$$

and:

$$
8^{7 \cdot 2} = 8^{14}
$$

So the simplified form is:

$$
a^{-4} \times 8^{14}
$$

Lastly, let’s do one with division. Suppose you have $$\frac{2^{-10}}{4^2}$$ and need to raise the whole thing to the $$7$$ power:

$$
\left(\frac{2^{-10}}{4^2}\right)^7 = \frac{(2^{-10})^7}{(4^2)^7}
$$

Simplifying it:

$$
(2^{-10})^7 = 2^{-70}
$$

and:

$$
(4^2)^7 = 4^{14}
$$

But, since $$4 = 2^2$$:

$$
4^{14} = (2^2)^{14} = 2^{28}
$$

So now we have:

$$
\frac{2^{-70}}{2^{28}}
$$

Since they have the same base, you subtract the exponents:

$$
2^{-70 - 28} = 2^{-98}
$$

So, the simplified expression is:

$$
2^{-98}
$$

Hope this helps make sense of things! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
