Sure, let's go through it together! We're going to practice evaluating expressions with two variables. Here’s our expression: 

$$7J + 5 - 8K$$ 

We’ll evaluate it when $$J = 0.5$$ and $$K = 0.25$$.

First, let's replace $$J$$ with $$0.5$$ and $$K$$ with $$0.25$$ in the expression:

$$7 \cdot 0.5 + 5 - 8 \cdot 0.25$$

Next, we multiply $$7$$ by $$0.5$$:

$$7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5$$

So now we have:

$$3.5 + 5 - 8 \cdot 0.25$$

Let's multiply $$8$$ by $$0.25$$. Remember, $$0.25$$ is the same as $$\frac{1}{4}$$:

$$8 \cdot 0.25 = 2$$

So the expression is now:

$$3.5 + 5 - 2$$

Add $$3.5$$ and $$5$$:

$$3.5 + 5 = 8.5$$

Finally, subtract $$2$$ from $$8.5$$:

$$8.5 - 2 = 6.5$$

So the value of the expression is $$6.5$$. Great job!

Now, let's do another one together. Let’s evaluate the expression:

$$0.1M + 8 - 12N$$

When $$M = 30$$ and $$N = 0.25$$.

First, replace $$M$$ with $$30$$ and $$N$$ with $$0.25$$:

$$0.1 \cdot 30 + 8 - 12 \cdot 0.25$$ 

Next, multiply $$0.1$$ by $$30$$. Remember, $$0.1$$ is the same as $$\frac{1}{10}$$:

$$0.1 \cdot 30 = 3$$

So now we have:

$$3 + 8 - 12 \cdot 0.25$$

Let's multiply $$12$$ by $$0.25$$:

$$12 \cdot 0.25 = 3$$

So the expression is now:

$$3 + 8 - 3$$

Add $$3$$ and $$8$$:

$$3 + 8 = 11$$

Finally, subtract $$3$$ from $$11$$:

$$11 - 3 = 8$$

So the value of the expression is $$8$$. Well done!
