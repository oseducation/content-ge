Hey there! Let's say we have this equation: 
$$0 = x^2 + 6x + 3$$ 
Now, we need to find the values of $$x$$ that make this equation true. Give it a shot and see if you can figure it out. Alright, let's work on it together now.

First, let's see if we can factor the right side of the equation, $$x^2 + 6x + 3$$. Factoring can help us solve it more easily. So, we need to find two numbers that add up to 6 (the coefficient of $$x$$) and multiply to 3 (the constant term).

Since 3 is a prime number, its only factors are 1 and 3. But 1 + 3 does not equal 6. So, factoring won't work here.

Next, let's try completing the square. This method will help us if there are any $$x$$ values that satisfy our equation. Here's how we do it:

We start with:
$$0 = x^2 + 6x + 3$$

Rewrite the equation but leave out the constant for now:
$$0 = x^2 + 6x + 3$$

We want to add and subtract the same number to the right side to make it a perfect square. The number we'll add is the square of half of the coefficient of $$x$$. So, half of 6 is 3, and squaring 3 gives us 9. Let's add and subtract 9:

$$0 = x^2 + 6x + 9 - 9 + 3$$

This can be simplified as:
$$0 = (x + 3)^2 - 6$$

Now, let's isolate $$(x + 3)^2$$ by adding 6 to both sides:
$$6 = (x + 3)^2$$

Next, we take the square root of both sides. Remember, taking the square root gives both positive and negative results:
$$\pm\sqrt{6} = x + 3$$

Finally, subtract 3 from both sides to solve for $$x$$:
$$x = -3 \pm \sqrt{6}$$

And there we have it! This means:
$$x = -3 + \sqrt{6}$$
or 
$$x = -3 - \sqrt{6}$$

Great job working through this! If you have any questions or need further clarification, just let me know!
