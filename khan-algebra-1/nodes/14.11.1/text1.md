Sure, let's chat about this function together!

We have a function given by $$f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$$. We're going to explore how we can write this function in other forms to find its important points, like its zeroes and its vertex.

First, to find where this function crosses the x-axis (the zeroes), we should factor the function. We need to think of two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to -5. These numbers are -2 and -3. So, we can rewrite the function as:

$$f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 3)$$

Now, to find the zeroes, we need to see when the function equals zero. That happens when either $$x - 2 = 0$$ or $$x - 3 = 0$$. Solving these, we get $$x = 2$$ and $$x = 3$$. So, the function intersects the x-axis at x = 2 and x = 3.

Next, let's figure out the vertex, which is the minimum point because our parabola opens upwards (since the coefficient of $$x^2$$ is positive). For this, a great method is completing the square. 

We start again with $$f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$$. To complete the square, we'll add and subtract the same value inside the function. Take the -5 coefficient, halve it to get -5/2, and then square it, which gives us $$(\frac{-5}{2})^2 = \frac{25}{4}$$. So, we rewrite the function as:

$$f(x) = x^2 - 5x + \left(\frac{25}{4} - \frac{25}{4}\right) + 6$$

This becomes:

$$f(x) = \left( x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} \right) - \frac{25}{4} + 6$$

The part inside the parentheses can be written as a perfect square:

$$f(x) = \left( x - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{25}{4} + 6$$

Now let's simplify $$-\frac{25}{4} + 6$$. Remember, 6 is the same as $$\frac{24}{4}$$, so:

$$-\frac{25}{4} + \frac{24}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}$$

Therefore, our function in vertex form is:

$$f(x) = \left( x - \frac{5}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{1}{4}$$

This form tells us the vertex of the function. The vertex is at $$x = \frac{5}{2}$$ and the minimum value of the function is $$-\frac{1}{4}$$. So, the vertex is at point $$(\frac{5}{2}, -\frac{1}{4})$$.

To sum up:

1. To find where the function crosses the x-axis: factor the function and solve for zeroes.
2. To find the vertex (the minimum point): complete the square.
