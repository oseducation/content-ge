Sure! Let's break it down together in a simple way. Here we go:

Hey there! Let's check out this graph of $$y = |x|$$, which you might have seen before. 

- If $$x = -2$$, the absolute value is 2.
- If $$x = -1$$, the absolute value is 1.
- If $$x = 0$$, the absolute value is 0.
- If $$x = 1$$, the absolute value is 1.

Now, let's think about how the equation changes if we move this graph. 

First, let's shift the graph 3 units to the right. Then, we'll think about what happens if we also move it 4 units up. 

Try pausing this and figuring out the new equation if we shift 3 units to the right and 4 units up. Ready? Let’s do it together!

First, let's shift the graph 3 units to the right. Here’s how we figure that out:

Imagine moving the graph to the right; it would look like this. For the graph to move right, something interesting happens at $$x = 3$$ now instead of at $$x = 0$$. Before, the graph switched direction at $$x = 0$$, but now it switches at $$x = 3$$. 

Since we’re working with absolute values, we know the new equation will look like $$y = |...|$$. 

To make $$y = 0$$ at $$x = 3$$, we need: 
$$|x - 3|$$. 

Let’s try some numbers:
- If $$x = 3$$, $$3 - 3 = 0$$, and $$|0| = 0$$.
- If $$x = 4$$, $$4 - 3 = 1$$, and $$|1| = 1$$.
- If $$x = 2$$, $$2 - 3 = -1$$, but $$|-1| = 1$$.

See how that works? When we shift 3 units to the right, our equation is $$y = |x - 3|$$.

Now, let's shift the graph 4 units up. This part is a bit simpler.

Imagine moving the graph up 4 units: 
- The graph that was $$y = 0$$ now moves up to $$y = 4$$.
- Our new equation becomes $$y = |x - 3| + 4$$.

When you move up, you add the number of units to the equation. If you moved down, you would subtract.

So, after all this shifting, the new equation for the graph is:
$$y = |x - 3| + 4$$.

I hope this helps! Feel free to try out these shifts with different numbers to see how it works and make it more intuitive for yourself. If you have any questions, just let me know!
