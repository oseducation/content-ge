Hey there! Let's work through this problem together in a fun and easy way!

Farmer Jan grows both broccoli and spinach on his farm. Last year, he grew 6 tons of broccoli per acre and 9 tons of spinach per acre, making a total of 93 tons of vegetables. This year, he grew 2 tons of broccoli per acre and 3 tons of spinach per acre, totaling 31 tons of vegetables. We need to find out how many acres of each crop Farmer Jan has.

Let’s use some math to figure it out!

First, we’ll call the number of acres of broccoli $B$ and the number of acres of spinach $S$. 

For last year:
- Broccoli: He grew 6 tons per acre. So, $$6B$$ tons of broccoli.
- Spinach: He grew 9 tons per acre. So, $$9S$$ tons of spinach.
- Total: $$6B + 9S = 93$$ tons.

For this year:
- Broccoli: He grew 2 tons per acre. So, $$2B$$ tons of broccoli.
- Spinach: He grew 3 tons per acre. So, $$3S$$ tons of spinach.
- Total: $$2B + 3S = 31$$ tons.

We now have two equations:

1. $$6B + 9S = 93$$
2. $$2B + 3S = 31$$

Let’s solve these equations.

First, let’s write them clearly:

$$6B + 9S = 93$$
$$2B + 3S = 31$$

To solve for $B$ and $S$, we can use a method to eliminate one of the variables. Let’s try to eliminate the B's. We can do this by multiplying the second equation by -3:

$$-3 \cdot (2B + 3S) = -3 \cdot 31$$

That gives us:

$$-6B - 9S = -93$$

Now, add this to the first equation:

$$6B + 9S = 93$$
$$-6B - 9S = -93$$

When we add these together, we get:

$$0 + 0 = 0$$

This simplifies to:

$$0 = 0$$

This tells us that every solution works and there are infinite solutions. So, there's no unique answer for $B$ and $S$. That means there isn't enough information to find exactly how many acres of broccoli and spinach Farmer Jan has.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions!
