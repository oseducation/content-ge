Sure! Let's chat about what Sal was explaining in simpler words.

Hey there! So earlier, we talked about the idea of equivalence in equations. Equivalence means that there are different ways to write the same thing in algebra. Let me give you some easy examples. If I say $$2x = 10$$ or $$x = 5$$, both of these are equivalent equations. Why? Because if $$x = 5$$ works in one equation, it works in the other too.

Let's look at another set of equivalent equations: $$2x = 8$$ and $$x = 4$$. These are also equivalent because both are true when $$x = 4$$.

Now, we're going to take this idea further and talk about equivalent systems of equations.

Imagine we have a system of two equations that describe a pair of $$x$$ and $$y$$ values:
$$
2x + y = 8
$$
$$
x + y = 5
$$

We can create an equivalent system by changing one or both of these equations to another form that says the same thing. For example, if you want to solve this system, you might think about making one of the equations easier to work with. 

Suppose we multiply the second equation $$x + y = 5$$ by $$-2$$. We get:
$$
-2(x + y) = -2(5)
$$
which simplifies to:
$$
-2x - 2y = -10
$$

Now we have two equations:
$$
2x + y = 8
$$
$$
-2x - 2y = -10
$$

This new system is equivalent to the original system. Any pair of $$x$$ and $$y$$ that solves one system will solve the other.

Another interesting thing you can do is add these equations together. When you add them, the $$x$$ terms will cancel out:
$$
(2x + y) + (-2x - 2y) = 8 + (-10)
$$
which simplifies to:
$$
-y = -2
$$

This new equation $$-y = -2$$ is equivalent to $$y = 2$$, another form of our system:
$$
2x + y = 8
$$
$$
y = 2
$$

Again, these are equivalent systems. We can make the equations easier to solve by performing operations that keep them equivalent. 

Let's keep going and make it clearer what $$x$$ and $$y$$ are. If we know $$y = 2$$, we can replace $$y$$ with $$2$$ in the first equation:
$$
2x + 2 = 8
$$

Simplifying this:
$$
2x = 6
$$
$$
x = 3
$$

So we get:
$$
x = 3
$$
$$
y = 2
$$

This tells us that the pair $$(3, 2)$$ is the solution to the system.

In the past, you might have just added equations or used substitution to find solutions. What we're really doing is rewriting the system step by step in equivalent ways to make it clear what the $$x$$ and $$y$$ values are.

Hope that makes sense! Feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
