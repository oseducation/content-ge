Hey there! So, I've got this big rectangle that's split into four little rectangles, and I want to show you two ways to find the area of the big rectangle. First, I'll show it as the product of two binomials, and then as a trinomial. Let's break it down together.

First, let's look at the height of the entire rectangle. From top to bottom, we see it's $$x$$ plus 2 (so, $$x + 2$$). Now, for the width: it's $$x$$ plus 3 (so, $$x + 3$$). So, the whole area of the big rectangle can be written as $$(x + 2) (x + 3)$$. That's the first way.

Now, let's express it as a trinomial by looking at the four smaller rectangles. 

1. The purple rectangle has a height of $$x$$ and a width of $$x$$, so its area is $$x^2$$.
2. The yellow rectangle has a height of $$x$$ and a width of 3, so its area is $$3x$$.
3. The green rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of $$x$$, so its area is $$2x$$.
4. The grey rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of 3, so its area is 6.

Now, we add up all these areas: $$x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6$$. At first, this doesn't look like a trinomial because it has four terms, but we can combine the $$3x$$ and $$2x$$ to get $$5x$$. So, we end up with $$x^2 + 5x + 6$$.

So, the area of the big rectangle can be written in two ways: $$(x + 2)(x + 3)$$ and $$x^2 + 5x + 6$$. Both are equal, and it shows how multiplying the binomials gives us the trinomial.

Let's quickly break down the multiplication to see why it works:

- $$x \cdot x = x^2$$
- $$x \cdot 3 = 3x$$
- $$2 \cdot x = 2x$$
- $$2 \cdot 3 = 6$$

This matches up with our trinomial: $$x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = x^2 + 5x + 6$$.

What we've done here is a visual way of understanding how multiplying binomials works. It's like using the distribution property twice, but seeing it this way can make it clearer. How do you feel about it?
