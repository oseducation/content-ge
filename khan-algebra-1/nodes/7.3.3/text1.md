Hey there! Let's break down this problem together, okay? ðŸ˜Š

So, Goku wants to get over 9000 comments on his YouTube videos. He gets a certain number of comments for each cat video he uploads, and a different number of comments for each dog video he uploads, but this number is always the same for all cat videos and similarly for all dog videos.

Here's what the problem tells us:

- $$C$$ stands for the number of cat videos.
- $$D$$ stands for the number of dog videos.
- The number of comments Goku gets from cat videos and dog videos combined needs to be more than 9000.

The inequality given is:
$$750C + 450D > 9000$$

This means:
- Each cat video gets 750 comments.
- Each dog video gets 450 comments.

Now, the question is whether Goku can reach or surpass 9000 comments by uploading 8 cat videos and 7 dog videos.

To figure this out, we need to plug these numbers into our inequality and see if it works:
$$750 \times 8 + 450 \times 7 > 9000$$

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. $$750 \times 8 = 6000$$
2. $$450 \times 7= 3150$$

Now, add these two results together:
$$6000 + 3150 = 9150$$

So, Goku would get a total of 9150 comments from 8 cat videos and 7 dog videos.

Since 9150 is greater than 9000, Goku can indeed reach his goal by uploading 8 cat videos and 7 dog videos. ðŸŽ‰

Isnâ€™t that cool? Let me know if you have any more questions! ðŸ˜ƒ
