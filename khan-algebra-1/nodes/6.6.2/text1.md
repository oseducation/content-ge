Sure! Let's work through this classic age word problem together. We're told that William is 4 times as old as Ben right now. Also, 12 years ago, William was 7 times as old as Ben. Our job is to find out how old Ben is now. 

First, let's call Ben's current age $$b$$. 

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Right now, Ben's age is $$b$$.
2. 12 years ago, Ben's age was $$b - 12$$.
3. Since William is 4 times as old as Ben now, William's age is $$4b$$.
4. 12 years ago, William's age was $$4b - 12$$.

Now let's use the information about ages 12 years ago:

William 12 years ago: $$4b - 12$$ was 7 times Ben's age 12 years ago: $$b - 12$$. 

So, we can write this as an equation:
$$
4b - 12 = 7(b - 12)
$$

Next, let's solve the equation step by step:
1. Distribute the 7 on the right side:
$$
4b - 12 = 7b - 84
$$

2. Combine like terms by subtracting $$7b$$ from both sides:
$$
4b - 7b - 12 = -84
$$

This simplifies to:
$$
-3b - 12 = -84
$$

3. Add 12 to both sides to isolate the $$b$$ term:
$$
-3b = -72
$$

4. Finally, divide both sides by -3 to solve for $$b$$:
$$
b = 24
$$

So, Ben is 24 years old now.

To double-check our work:
- William is 4 times Ben's age, so William is $$4 \times 24 = 96$$ years old.
- 12 years ago, Ben was $$24 - 12 = 12$$ years old.
- 12 years ago, William was $$96 - 12 = 84$$ years old.
- Indeed, 12 years ago, William's age (84) is 7 times Ben's age (12), as $$7 \times 12 = 84$$.

Everything checks out! Ben is 24 years old now.
