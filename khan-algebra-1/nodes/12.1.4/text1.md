Alright, let's think this through together. We have a table showing the cost of buying a small piece of land in a remote village starting from the year 1990. We want to know which type of function best fits this relationship. We're deciding between a linear function and an exponential function.

So, take a moment to think about it on your own first.

Now, let's look at it together. With time increasing by a constant number (here, it goes up by 2 years each time: from 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, and so on), we need to see if the cost behaves in a certain way.

In a linear relationship, if the time change is constant, the cost change should also be consistent. This doesn’t mean it has to be the exact same amount, but it should be close. In an exponential relationship, we'd multiply by the same factor each time the time changes.

Checking the numbers, let's see:

- To go from 30 to 36.9, we add 6.9.
- From 36.9 to 44.1, we add 7.2.
- From 44.1 to 51.1, we add 7.
- From 51.1 to 57.9, we add 6.8.
- From 57.9 to 65.1, we add 7.2.

These differences aren't exactly the same each time, but they are pretty close, around 7 each time. Real-world data often doesn't match a model perfectly but can still give us a good idea.

If this were an exponential model, we'd multiply by a constant number each step. However, it doesn’t look like we’re doing that since the factor we’d multiply by seems to change.

So, even though the added amounts aren’t identical, they are very close. The pattern suggests that every 2 years, the cost goes up by about 7. This fits a linear model pretty well. If we were to plot the data on a graph, it would form points that almost line up, indicating a line.

So, it seems like a linear model is our best choice here!
