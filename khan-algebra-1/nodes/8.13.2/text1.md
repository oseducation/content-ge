Sure, let's break this down step by step and use simpler language. Here we go!

Hey there! You might already know how to find the value of a function when you put in a specific number. For example, let's say we have a table defining our function. If someone asks, "What is $$f(-9)$$?" you look at the table and see that when $$x = -9$$, the value of $$f(x)$$ is 5.

Now, you might have also worked with composite functions. This is when you put one function inside another. If we need to find $$f(f(-9 + 1))$$, it might look scary at first. But let's break it down! 

1. Find $$f(-9)$$, which we know is 5.
2. So, this becomes $$f(5 + 1)$$, which is the same as $$f(6)$$.
3. Now, look at the table again to find $$f(6)$$, which is -7.

So now, letâ€™s talk about something new: the inverse of a function. A function $$f$$ is invertible if every $$x$$ maps to a unique $$f(x)$$, meaning no two xs have the same f(x).

If we want to find $$f^{-1}(8)$$, or the inverse of $$f$$ at 8, we need to think differently. The inverse function $$f^{-1}$$ takes a value from the range and maps it back to the domain.

Hereâ€™s how you can think about it:
- We know $$f(x)$$ from the table.
- $$f^{-1}(8)$$ means "what $$x$$ value gives us 8 when we use the function $$f$$?"

Look at the table: $$f(9) = 8$$. So, $$f^{-1}(8) = 9$$.

To make it easier, you can create a new table where you switch the columns. If $$f(x)$$ goes from -9 to 5, then $$f^{-1}(x)$$ goes from 5 to -9. 

Now letâ€™s check a couple more examples to make sure we're comfortable:

1. Find $$f(f^{-1}(7))$$:
   - First, $$f^{-1}(7)$$ from the table: it maps 7 to -7.
   - Then, find $$f(-7)$$: Look at the table, $$f(-7) = 7$$.
   - So, $$f(f^{-1}(7)) = 7$$.

2. Find $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(13))$$:
   - First, you need $$f^{-1}(13)$$: from the table, it maps 13 to 5.
   - Then find $$f^{-1}(5)$$: Look at the table, $$f^{-1}(5) = -9$$.
   - So, $$f^{-1}(f^{-1}(13)) = -9$$.

At first, working with functions and their inverses might seem confusing because you're going back and forth. But just remember: the function maps one set of numbers to another, and the inverse maps it back the other way. Switching the columns in the table can help make this more clear.

I hope that makes more sense now! Functions and inverses are all about going from one set of numbers to another and then back again. Just switch the columns, and it gets easier to understand. ðŸ˜Š
