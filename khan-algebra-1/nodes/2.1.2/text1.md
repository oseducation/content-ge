Alright, let’s work together to solve a more complicated equation. Imagine we have this equation: 

$$2x + 3 = 5x - 2$$

At first, it might seem a bit scary because we have $$x$$ on both sides and we are adding and subtracting numbers. But don’t worry, we can handle this! The main goal here is to get $$x$$ by itself on one side. Once we do that, we can find out what $$x$$ equals.

To do this, we'll perform several steps on both sides of the equation until $$x$$ is isolated. I want to help you picture what’s happening, so you won't just memorize steps, but understand them.

Let’s break the equation down:

On the left side, $$2x$$ means we have $$x$$ plus $$x$$, and then we add 3: 
$$x + x + 3$$

On the right side, $$5x - 2$$ means we have 5 $$x$$’s together but we subtract 2: 
$$x + x + x + x + x - 2$$

To make things simpler, imagine circles for the numbers and $$x$$s for the $$x$$s. You won’t have to do this every time, but it helps to see what’s happening.

Now, we want to get all the $$x$$s on one side. There are two ways we can do this:

1. Subtract $$2x$$ from both sides
2. Subtract $$5x$$ from both sides

Let’s try subtracting $$2x$$ from both sides:

$$ 2x + 3 - 2x = 5x - 2 - 2x $$

On the left, $$2x - 2x$$ cancels out, leaving us with just 3. On the right, $$5x - 2x$$ becomes $$3x - 2$$:

So now it looks like:

$$ 3 = 3x - 2 $$

Next, we need to get rid of the -2 next to the $$3x$$ on the right. We can do this by adding 2 to both sides:

$$ 3 + 2 = 3x - 2 + 2 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ 5 = 3x $$

Now we need to get $$x$$ by itself. Since $$3x$$ means 3 times $$x$$, we’ll divide both sides by 3:

$$ \frac{5}{3} = x $$

So $$ x = \frac{5}{3} $$

We sometimes write fractions like this as mixed numbers, where $$ \frac{5}{3} $$ is the same as $$1 \frac{2}{3} $$.

So:

$$ x = 1 \frac{2}{3} $$

You can always substitute $$x = 1 \frac{2}{3} $$ back into the original equation to check if it works.

If you’re still picturing it, think of dividing both sides into three parts. On one side, you'd get $$1 \frac{2}{3}$$ in each part, balancing out the three pieces of $$x$$ on the other side.

I hope that makes it clearer! Keep practicing and soon these steps will feel like second nature.
