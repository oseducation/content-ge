**Lecture on Abstract**

---

Hello everyone! Today, I want to talk to you about the term **abstract**. You'll hear me use this word often, so it's important to understand what it means. Let's dive in.

**Defining Abstract:**

- **Adjective:** You can have an abstract idea or abstract art.
- **Verb:** You can abstract something, that means taking an idea from another idea.
- **Noun:** An abstract can be a summary, like the abstract of a research paper.

**Common Theme:**

No matter how you use the word abstract, it usually means taking the essence of a real-world object and thinking about it in terms of ideas and concepts.

**Real World vs. Ideas:**

- In the real world, we have physical objects.
- In the world of ideas, we think about the essence of those objects.

**Example of Abstraction in Geometry:**

Think about geometric shapes, like a **cube**:
- In your mind, you know what a cube looks like: all sides are equal.
- Real-world examples: a Borg vessel, a pair of dice, a Rubik's cube, or a cube-shaped building.  
- Even if these objects look different, they share the **cubeness** in common.

A cube in geometry is defined as an object where all sides are the same length. In reality, nothing is a perfect cube, but the idea of a cube has all sides equal.

**Example of Abstraction in Art:**

**Abstract Art**:
- Abstract art is not about painting reality exactly as it is. 
- For example, in the Renaissance, artists painted figures that looked like real people.
- Abstract artists focus on expressing ideas or feelings through color, form, and texture.
- Look at a **Jackson Pollock** painting: it doesn't represent a tree, a dog, or anything in reality. It's about colors and patterns.

**Abstraction in Everyday Life:**

- Words and symbols are abstract representations of real things.
- When I say **dog**, you think of qualities like four legs, floppy ears, and being friendly.
- Different dogs look different, like Great Danes and poodles, but we understand the essence of "dog".

- Numbers are also abstract. For instance, when I write the number **5**, it represents a quantity.
  - We could symbolize 5 in various ways, like "5", "V" (Roman numeral), or even tally marks.
  - All these symbols represent the same abstract idea of five things.

**Conclusion:**

I hope this helps you appreciate what abstract means. It's a bit tricky because, well, the idea of abstraction is itself abstract! But understanding this will deepen your appreciation for the concepts we’ll explore in the future.Hi there! I wanted to talk about the word "abstract" because you'll hear me use it quite a bit. Let me give you a sense of what abstract means. It can be an adjective, a verb, or even a noun!

As an adjective, you can have an abstract idea or abstract art. As a verb, you can abstract something, like taking an idea from another idea. As a noun, you might have an abstract, like the summary of a research paper that captures its essence.

No matter how you use it, the word "abstract" means taking the essence of something real and moving more into the world of ideas and concepts. Let me explain with an example.

Imagine I ask you to find some cubes. You might point to:
- A pair of dice
- A Rubik's cube
- A building that looks like a cube
- A box in your house that’s cube-shaped

In your mind, you have a general idea of what a cube is. Even though these examples look different, they all share "cubeness." The idea of a cube in geometry is an object where each side has the same length, like $$1$$ unit. Even if real-world cubes aren't perfect (like a die with divots), the abstract idea of a cube is that all sides are the same length.

This is moving from the specific, real-world object to the general, abstract idea. 

You might also have heard of abstract art. Unlike Renaissance art, which tries to show reality exactly as it is, abstract art focuses on ideas and feelings. For example, Jackson Pollock's paintings don’t try to represent anything specific. They show an idea, color, and texture independently of anything real.

Abstraction isn't just in art and geometry; it’s in our daily life too. When we talk or use symbols, we’re abstracting ideas. Think of the word "dog." It’s just a set of letters, but it brings to mind a real animal with four legs, floppy ears, and a wagging tail. Even though Great Danes and poodles look different, they’re both "dogs" because they have the essence of a dog.

Numbers are abstract too. When I write $$5$$, it’s just a symbol for a quantity of things. I could write it as $$\mathbf{V}$$ in Roman numerals, but it still means five. The number $$5$$ is an idea that represents five items, no matter how it’s written.

I hope this helps you understand what "abstract" means. It’s a bit abstract itself, but I believe you’re getting the hang of it!
