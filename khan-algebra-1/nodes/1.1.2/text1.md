**Lecture on Abstract**

---

Hello everyone! Today, I want to talk to you about the term **abstract**. You'll hear me use this word often, so it's important to understand what it means. Let's dive in.

**Defining Abstract:**

- **Adjective:** You can have an abstract idea or abstract art.
- **Verb:** You can abstract something, that means taking an idea from another idea.
- **Noun:** An abstract can be a summary, like the abstract of a research paper.

**Common Theme:**

No matter how you use the word abstract, it usually means taking the essence of a real-world object and thinking about it in terms of ideas and concepts.

**Real World vs. Ideas:**

- In the real world, we have physical objects.
- In the world of ideas, we think about the essence of those objects.

**Example of Abstraction in Geometry:**

Think about geometric shapes, like a **cube**:
- In your mind, you know what a cube looks like: all sides are equal.
- Real-world examples: a Borg vessel, a pair of dice, a Rubik's cube, or a cube-shaped building.  
- Even if these objects look different, they share the **cubeness** in common.

A cube in geometry is defined as an object where all sides are the same length. In reality, nothing is a perfect cube, but the idea of a cube has all sides equal.

**Example of Abstraction in Art:**

**Abstract Art**:
- Abstract art is not about painting reality exactly as it is. 
- For example, in the Renaissance, artists painted figures that looked like real people.
- Abstract artists focus on expressing ideas or feelings through color, form, and texture.
- Look at a **Jackson Pollock** painting: it doesn't represent a tree, a dog, or anything in reality. It's about colors and patterns.

**Abstraction in Everyday Life:**

- Words and symbols are abstract representations of real things.
- When I say **dog**, you think of qualities like four legs, floppy ears, and being friendly.
- Different dogs look different, like Great Danes and poodles, but we understand the essence of "dog".

- Numbers are also abstract. For instance, when I write the number **5**, it represents a quantity.
  - We could symbolize 5 in various ways, like "5", "V" (Roman numeral), or even tally marks.
  - All these symbols represent the same abstract idea of five things.

**Conclusion:**

I hope this helps you appreciate what abstract means. It's a bit tricky because, well, the idea of abstraction is itself abstract! But understanding this will deepen your appreciation for the concepts weâ€™ll explore in the future.
