Sure! Let's walk through the steps together to find the intercepts and graph the line. 

### Finding the Intercepts:

We have the equation $$-5x + 4y = 20$$, and we need to find where this line crosses the x-axis and y-axis. These points are called intercepts.

- **x-intercept**: This is where the line crosses the x-axis. At this point, $$y = 0$$.
- **y-intercept**: This is where the line crosses the y-axis. At this point, $$x = 0$$.

### Finding the x-intercept:

1. Set $$y = 0$$ in the equation:
   $$-5x + 4(0) = 20$$.
2. This simplifies to:
   $$-5x = 20$$.
3. Solve for $$x$$:
   $$x = \frac{20}{-5}$$.
   $$x = -4$$.

So, the x-intercept is at $$( -4, 0 )$$.

### Finding the y-intercept:

1. Set $$x = 0$$ in the equation:
   $$-5(0) + 4y = 20$$.
2. This simplifies to:
   $$4y = 20$$.
3. Solve for $$y$$:
   $$y = \frac{20}{4}$$.
   $$y = 5$$.

So, the y-intercept is at $$( 0, 5 )$$.

### Plotting and Graphing:

1. Plot the point $$ (-4, 0) $$ on the x-axis.
2. Plot the point $$ (0, 5) $$ on the y-axis.
3. Draw a line through these points to graph the equation.

That's it! We've now found the intercepts and graphed the line. This method helps us quickly see where the line crosses the axes.
