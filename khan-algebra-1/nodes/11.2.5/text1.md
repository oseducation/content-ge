Sure, let's break it down together!

First, let's talk about finding the fifth root of 32. Take a minute to think about it yourself before we go through it.

When we talk about the fifth root of a number, like 32, it means we’re looking for a number $$x$$ such that $$x^5 = 32$$. In simpler terms, we need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself five times, equals 32.

Here’s one way to do it: Factor 32 and see if there’s a number that shows up five times. Since 32 is even, we start by dividing by 2. Breaking it down:

$$32 = 2 \times 16$$  
$$16 = 2 \times 8$$  
$$8 = 2 \times 4$$  
$$4 = 2 \times 2$$  

So, $$32 = 2^5$$.

Now we rewrite the fifth root of 32 like this: 
$$\sqrt[5]{2^5} = 2$$. 

Next, let’s find the fifth root of 243.

We can try factoring 243 first. Start with the smallest factor. It’s not divisible by 2, but it is by 3 (since 2 + 4 + 3 = 9, and 9 is divisible by 3):

$$243 = 3 \times 81$$  
$$81 = 3 \times 27$$  
$$27 = 3 \times 9$$  
$$9 = 3 \times 3$$  

So, $$243 = 3^5$$.

This means $$\sqrt[5]{3^5} = 3$$.

Alternatively, you could use trial and error. We know:

- $$1^5 = 1$$
- $$2^5 = 32$$ (from earlier)

To check $$4^5$$:

$$4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 1024$$.

That’s much higher than 243. So, if you’re looking for an integer solution, guessing 3 is a good idea, and you’d find $$3^5 = 243$$.
