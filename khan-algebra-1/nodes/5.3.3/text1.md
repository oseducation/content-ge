Sure! Let's break this down together. We want to find the equation of a line that moves through the points (-1, 6) and (5, -4). Let's try to picture this.

First, imagine drawing an x-axis and a y-axis. It's always helpful to visualize the problem. We have the point (-1, 6): go left 1 from the origin and then up 6. Now, we have the point (5, -4): go right 5 from the origin and then down 4. Connecting these points, you can imagine a line going through them.

Next, to find the equation of this line, we need to find its slope (m) and y-intercept (b). The general form of the equation is $$y = mx + b$$. 

Let's start with the slope (m). The slope is the change in y divided by the change in x, which is also called "rise over run." Using the points (-1, 6) and (5, -4), we calculate the change in y as follows: 

$$\text{change in y} = y_2 - y_1 = -4 - 6 = -10$$

Next, let's calculate the change in x:

$$\text{change in x} = x_2 - x_1 = 5 - (-1) = 5 + 1 = 6$$

So, the slope (m) is:

$$m = \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}} = \frac{-10}{6} = \frac{-5}{3}$$

Now that we have the slope, our equation looks like:

$$y = -\frac{5}{3}x + b$$

To find the y-intercept (b), we use one of the points. Let's use (-1, 6). We substitute x = -1 and y = 6 into the equation:

$$6 = -\frac{5}{3}(-1) + b$$

This simplifies to:

$$6 = \frac{5}{3} + b$$

To solve for b, subtract $$\frac{5}{3}$$ from both sides:

$$6 - \frac{5}{3} = b$$

Convert 6 into a fraction to make subtraction easier:

$$6 = \frac{18}{3}$$

So,

$$\frac{18}{3} - \frac{5}{3} = \frac{13}{3}$$

Therefore, b = $$\frac{13}{3}$$.

Now we have the full equation of our line:

$$y = -\frac{5}{3}x + \frac{13}{3}$$

If you prefer to visualize it as mixed numbers, $$\frac{13}{3}$$ is the same as $$4 \frac{1}{3}$$, and $$-\frac{5}{3}$$ is $$-1 \frac{2}{3}$$.

So our final equation is:

$$y = -\frac{5}{3}x + \frac{13}{3}$$

I hope that helps! Do you have any other questions?
