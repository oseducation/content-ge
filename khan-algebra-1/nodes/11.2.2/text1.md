Hi there! Let's find the square root of 100 together. 

When we talk about the square root, we use this symbol that looks like a big check mark: $$\sqrt{}$$. So, we are looking for $$\sqrt{100}$$. 

This symbol here means we are looking for the positive square root. You might know that numbers also have negative square roots, but for this problem, we will stick with the positive one. 

So, what does this mean? We need to find the number that, when we multiply it by itself, gives us 100. 

Let's see:
- If we multiply 9 by itself, we get 81 (because $$9 \times 9 = 81$$).
- If we multiply 10 by itself, we get 100 (because $$10 \times 10 = 100$$).

So, the square root of 100 is 10. We can write it like this:
$$\sqrt{100} = 10$$.

To put it another way, if we take 10 and square it (which means multiplying it by itself), we get 100. We can write this as:
$$10^2 = 100$$.

Does that make sense? The square root of 100 is 10!
