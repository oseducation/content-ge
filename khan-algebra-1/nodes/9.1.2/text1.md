Hey there! Let's chat about a certain type of sequence in Math called arithmetic sequences. These sequences are pretty common and they're easy to recognize. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is a fixed number larger than the one before it.

What we're going to do now is see which of the given sequences are arithmetic. Also, we'll practice writing these sequences in a couple of different ways: explicitly as a function or using a recursive definition.

So, what's an arithmetic sequence again? It's where each term is incremented by the same amount compared to the term before it. Let's look at the first sequence:

To go from $$-5$$ to $$-3$$, we add $$2$$. From $$-3$$ to $$-1$$, we add $$2$$ again. And from $$-1$$ to $$1$$, we add $$2$$ once more. So, this is definitely an arithmetic sequence since we're always adding the same amount, which is $$2$$.

Now, there are a couple of ways to define this sequence:

1. **Explicit Definition:** This gives us a direct formula to find any term. 
   \[
   a_n = -5 + 2(n - 1)
   \]
   Here, $$a_n$$ is the $$n$$th term, $$-5$$ is the first term, and $$2(n - 1)$$ is how much we add based on which term we want.

2. **Recursive Definition:** This shows the sequence by referring to the previous term:
   \[
   a_1 = -5 
   \]
   \[
   a_n = a_{n-1} + 2 \quad \text{for } n \geq 2
   \]

Both methods are perfectly fine ways to define this arithmetic sequence.

Now, let’s check the next sequence:

We start at $$100$$, then go to $$107$$ (add $$7$$), then to $$114$$ (add $$7$$ again), and then to $$121$$ (add $$7$$ again). So yes, this is an arithmetic sequence as well.

We can write it in two ways too:

1. **Explicit Definition:**
   \[
   a_n = 100 + 7(n - 1)
   \]

2. **Recursive Definition:**
   \[
   a_1 = 100
   \]
   \[
   a_n = a_{n-1} + 7 \quad \text{for } n \geq 2
   \]

Now, we have a formula to check if any sequence is arithmetic:
1. **Explicit Form:** 
   \[
   a_n = k + d (n - 1)
   \]
   Here, $$k$$ is the first term and $$d$$ is the fixed number we add each time.
   
2. **Recursive Form:** 
   \[
   a_1 = k
   \]
   \[
   a_n = a_{n-1} + d \quad \text{for } n \ge 2
   \]
These formulas can help us spot and define any arithmetic sequence!

Lastly, let’s look at the third sequence to see if it’s arithmetic. It starts at $$1$$, then adds $$2$$, then $$3$$, followed by $$4$$. Here, the added amount keeps changing, so this sequence isn’t arithmetic. But we can still define it:

1. **Recursive Definition:**
   \[
   a_1 = 1
   \]
   \[
   a_n = a_{n-1} + n \quad \text{for } n \ge 2
   \]

Even though this sequence isn't arithmetic, it’s still interesting because we’re adding the position number each time.

And that's it! Remember, arithmetic sequences add the same amount each time, and we can describe them either explicitly or recursively. If you have more questions, feel free to ask!
