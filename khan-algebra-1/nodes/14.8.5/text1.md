Hey there! In our last video, we talked about what to do if you have a quadratic equation like:

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

We learned that you can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions to this equation. The quadratic formula is:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

You just plug in the values for $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$, and you'll get two answers because of the $$\pm$$ sign.

Now, what I want to do in this video is to prove to you how this formula works by completing the square. So let's get started!

First, let's rewrite the equation:

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

To make things simpler, we divide everything by $$a$$, giving us:

$$x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0$$

Next, we move the $$\frac{c}{a}$$ term to the right side:

$$x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}$$

Now, we'll complete the square. We take half of the $$\frac{b}{a}$$ coefficient and square it. Half of $$\frac{b}{a}$$ is $$\frac{b}{2a}$$, and squaring it gives us $$\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$$.

We add that squared term to both sides:

$$x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$$

On the left side, we now have a perfect square trinomial:

$$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}$$

Simplifying the right side:

$$\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}$$

Next, we take the square root of both sides:

$$x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Finally, we isolate $$x$$ by subtracting $$\frac{b}{2a}$$ from both sides:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

And thatâ€™s it! We derived the quadratic formula starting from the initial quadratic equation. I hope you found that as interesting as I did. Keep practicing, and you'll get even better at this!
