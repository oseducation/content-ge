Hey there! Let's work on graphing the equation $$y = 5^x$$ together. We'll keep it simple by choosing some values for $$x$$ and seeing what we get for $$y$$. Then, we'll plot those points on a graph.

First, we'll try some negative and positive values for $$x$$, centering them around 0. Here's our plan:

- When $$x = -2$$, we have $$y = 5^{-2}$$. That equals $$\frac{1}{5^2}$$ or $$\frac{1}{25}$$.
- When $$x = -1$$, we get $$y = 5^{-1}$$, which is $$\frac{1}{5}$$.
- When $$x = 0$$, it’s nice and simple: $$y = 5^0$$, which equals 1.
- When $$x = 1$$, $$y = 5^1$$, giving us 5.
- When $$x = 2$$, $$y = 5^2$$, which makes 25.

Now, let's put these points on a graph. Our $$x$$ values range from -2 to 2, and our $$y$$ values go from $$\frac{1}{25}$$ up to 25. Here’s how it looks on a graph:

1. Draw the $$x$$-axis and $$y$$-axis.
2. Mark your $$x$$-axis from -2 to 2.
3. For the $$y$$-axis, we’ll need to mark points like 1/25, 1/5, 1, 5, and 25.

Point plotting:

- At $$x = -2$$, $$y = 1/25$$: This point is very close to the x-axis.
- At $$x = -1$$, $$y = 1/5$$: This point is also close to the x-axis, a little higher than 1/25.
- At $$x = 0$$, $$y = 1$$: This is exactly at 1 on the y-axis.
- At $$x = 1$$, $$y = 5$$: Plot this at 5 on the y-axis.
- At $$x = 2$$, $$y = 25$$: Plot this at 25 on the y-axis.

Once you connect these points, you'll see that as $$x$$ gets more negative, $$y$$ gets closer to 0 but never quite reaches it. When $$x$$ is positive, $$y$$ rapidly increases, showing what’s called "exponential growth." This means the graph shoots up very quickly, like a hockey stick.

Remember, for very large negative values of $$x$$, $$y$$ gets closer and closer to 0 but never hits 0. For very large positive values of $$x$$, $$y$$ becomes a huge number.

Let’s draw it all: Starting from the left, the curve is just above 0, gets slightly higher as $$x$$ approaches 0, and then shoots up rapidly beyond $$x = 0$$.

And there you go! That's the graph of $$y = 5^x$$, showing how it behaves both for negative and positive $$x$$ values. Nice work!
