Hey there! I heard that all the Chuck Norris stuff in the last video might have been a bit too much for some folks, so this time I'm going for something calmer. Let's see if we can make these expressions easier to understand. We're just using ideas you've already learned.

Imagine you want to simplify the expression $$2 \times (3x + 5)$$. This means you have two of the $$(3x + 5)$$ expressions. So it's like writing:

$$(3x + 5) + (3x + 5)$$.

Now, let's break it down. We have two $$3x$$ parts and two $$5$$ parts. So we can write it like this:

$$2 \times 3x + 2 \times 5$$.

You might recognize this as the distributive property from arithmetic: $$2 \times (3x + 5) = 2 \times 3x + 2 \times 5$$. And that's exactly right! Now let's simplify these:

$$2 \times 3x = 6x$$ and $$2 \times 5 = 10$$.

So, the expression simplifies to:

$$6x + 10$$.

Now, let's try something a bit more involved. Don't worry, it's still based on what you know. Suppose you have:

$$7 \times (3y - 5) - 2 \times (10 + 4y)$$.

We'll start with the left side, which is $$7 \times (3y - 5)$$. Distribute the 7:

$$7 \times 3y = 21y$$ and $$7 \times (-5) = -35$$.

So the left side simplifies to:

$$21y - 35$$.

Now let's look at the right side, $$2 \times (10 + 4y)$$. Think of the -2 as a negative number, and distribute it:

$$-2 \times 10 = -20$$ and $$-2 \times 4y = -8y$$.

The right side becomes:

$$-20 - 8y$$.

Now we can put it all together:

$$21y - 35 - 20 - 8y$$.

Combine the like terms: you have $$21y$$ and $$-8y$$, which gives you:

$$21y - 8y = 13y$$.

And for the numbers, $$-35 - 20 = -55$$.

So, the whole expression simplifies to:

$$13y - 55$$.

See? We used the distributive property and combined like terms. Great job!
