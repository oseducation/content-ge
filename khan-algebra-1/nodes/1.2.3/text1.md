Sure! Let's break it down together:

A local hospital is having a raffle to raise money. The cost for each person to take part in the raffle is given by the expression $$5t + 3$$. Here, $$t$$ is the number of tickets someone buys. We need to figure out the cost when $$t$$ is 1, 8, and 10.

First, let's see what happens when $$t = 1$$:
- The expression becomes $$5 \cdot 1 + 3$$.
- According to order of operations, we do the multiplication first.
- So, $$5 \cdot 1 = 5$$.
- Adding 3 gives us $$5 + 3 = 8$$.

So, if someone buys 1 ticket, the cost is 8 units of money.

Next, when $$t = 8$$:
- The expression is $$5 \cdot 8 + 3$$.
- Again, do the multiplication first: $$5 \cdot 8 = 40$$.
- Then add the 3: $$40 + 3 = 43$$.

Thus, for 8 tickets, the cost is 43 units of money.

Lastly, when $$t = 10$$:
- The expression turns into $$5 \cdot 10 + 3$$.
- First, multiply: $$5 \cdot 10 = 50$$.
- Then add 3: $$50 + 3 = 53$$.

So, if someone buys 10 tickets, the cost is 53 units of money.

And that's it! We found the cost for 1, 8, and 10 tickets using our expression.
