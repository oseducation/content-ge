Sure! Let's go through this step-by-step. ðŸ˜Š

You want to know if the system of linear equations below is dependent or independent. I'll explain the difference first, so it's clear.

When we talk about a system of linear equations in two dimensions (like on a graph), there are three things that can happen between the lines:

1. The lines intersect at one point.
2. The lines are parallel and never intersect.
3. The lines are the same, so they overlap completely.

Let me draw these to help you see it better.

First, think of a graph with an x-axis and y-axis. 

In the first case, the lines cross at one point:
$$
\text{Line 1: } \ y = 2x + 3 
$$
$$
\text{Line 2: } \ y = -x + 1
$$
They meet at one spot.

In the second case, the lines are parallel and never meet:
$$
\text{Line 1: } \ y = 2x + 3
$$
$$
\text{Line 2: } \ y = 2x + 5
$$
Same slope, different y-intercepts.

In the third case, the lines are exactly the same:
$$
\text{Line 1: } \ y = 2x + 3
$$
$$
\text{Line 2: } \ y = 2x + 3
$$
Every point on one line is also on the other.

Now, when the lines donâ€™t intersect at all (parallel lines), we call this system "inconsistent." When they do intersect, we call the system "consistent."

Within consistent systems, if they intersect at only one point, it's "independent." If they overlap completely, it's "dependent."

So letâ€™s check the system you have here. Let's say we have these two equations:
$$
4x + 2y = 16
$$
$$
y = -2x + 8
$$

First, the second equation is already in slope-intercept form, which is great. Its slope is -2, and its y-intercept is 8.

Now let's rearrange the first one to look the same.

Starting with:
$$
4x + 2y = 16
$$

Subtract $$4x$$ from both sides:
$$
2y = -4x + 16
$$

Then, divide everything by 2:
$$
y = -2x + 8
$$

Notice this is the same as the second equation: 
$$
y = -2x + 8.
$$ 

So both equations are really the same line! This means they overlap completely and have an infinite number of points where they intersect. 

Therefore, these two lines are dependent, not independent. They are the same line with the same slope and y-intercept.
