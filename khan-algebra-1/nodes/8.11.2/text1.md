Alright, let's break this down step-by-step together!

We need to find over which interval the function $$y(x)$$ has an average rate of change of negative 4. 

When we talk about the average rate of change, we're simply finding the average slope of the function over a certain interval. Imagine a U-shaped curve: at the left side, the slope is very steep and negative, it gets less steep, reaching a point where it’s flat ($$slope = 0$$). Then it becomes positive and continues to increase. If you look at the entire U-shape, the starting and ending points are at the same height.

From this, you can say the total change in $$y$$ (net change) is zero, and hence the average rate of change across this interval is zero. 

To find the average rate of change between two points, you just need the slope of the line that connects these two points. So, if you're asked for an interval where the slope between its endpoints is negative 4, you're looking for this specific slope.

Let’s see what options we're given. 

For the interval $$-1 \leq x \leq 1$$:
- When $$x = -1$$, $$ y(-1) = 7$$ (the y-value is 7 when x is -1).
- When $$x = 1$$, $$ y(1) = -1$$ (the y-value is -1 when x is 1).

Now, let's find the slope between these two points:

\[
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-1 - 7}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4
\]

So, the slope, which is the average rate of change, is indeed negative 4.

Every time we move one unit to the right in the x-direction, the function $$y$$ decreases by 4 units. 

Therefore, the interval from $$x = -1$$ to $$x = 1$$ has an average rate of change of negative 4. 

We don't need to check any other intervals because this one perfectly fits our requirement. 

Great job! You've got it!
