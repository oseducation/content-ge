Hi there! Let's take a look at a fun problem about Felipe and his dog's food. Felipe feeds his dog the same amount every day from a big bag of dog food. Two weeks after opening the bag, Felipe starts weighing how much food is left each week. Here's what he found:

- After 14 days, there's 14 kilograms left.
- After 21 days, there's 10.5 kilograms left.
- After 28 days, there's 7 kilograms left.

We'll use this data to answer some interesting questions, and maybe we'll even draw it out on a graph.

First, let's figure out how much food was in the bag at the beginning, given that Felipe uses the same amount of food each week. How do you think we can find that out?

To make it easier, let's draw the data on a graph. Here’s how we can set it up:
- The x-axis (horizontal line) will show the number of days.
- The y-axis (vertical line) will show the amount of food left in kilograms.

Let’s mark the points on the graph:
- On day 14, 14 kilograms are left.
- On day 21, 10.5 kilograms are left.
- On day 28, 7 kilograms are left.

Assuming Felipe feeds his dog the same amount each week, these points should form a line. By drawing this line, we can find out how much food was in the bag at the start (day 0).

We can see from the graph that if we go back to day 0, the line hits a little over 20 kilograms. Let's get the exact amount by finding the slope, which is how steep the line is. The slope shows how quickly the food is used up.

We see that:
- Every 14 days, Felipe uses up 7 kilograms.
- So, every week (7 days), he uses up 3.5 kilograms.

Now, if we go back 14 days from 14 kilograms left (day 14), we'll go up by 7 kilograms. So on day 0, there were 21 kilograms in the bag. We found this by looking at the y-intercept (where the line hits the y-axis).

Let's answer another question: How much food does Felipe feed his dog each day? 

Since 7 kilograms are used every 14 days, we can calculate:
$$ \text{Slope} = \frac{-7 \text{ kilograms}}{14 \text{ days}} = -\frac{1}{2} \text{ kilograms per day} $$

This means Felipe feeds his dog half a kilogram each day.

Now, let's find out how many days the bag will last. We need to see when the amount of food left reaches 0. This happens where the line hits the x-axis (x-intercept).

From 7 kilograms left on day 28, going forward 14 more days will use up the last 7 kilograms. So the bag will last until day 42.

I hope this helps you understand how to use data and graphs to solve problems! Feel free to ask if you have more questions.
