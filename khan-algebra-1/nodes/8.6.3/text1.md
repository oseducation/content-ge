Hi there! Let's talk about Pooja's plant, shall we?

Pooja had a lovely plant. It started growing 2 days before she got it, and she took care of it for 98 days until it died. At its highest, the plant was 30 centimeters tall. 

Now, let's use $$h(t)$$ to show the height of Pooja's plant, where $$h$$ is the height in centimeters and $$t$$ is the number of days since she bought the plant. We want to figure out if $$t$$ should be integers (like 0, 1, 2) or real numbers (like 0.5, 3.175).

The domain of a function is all the possible input values (in this case, $$t$$). If $$t$$ represents days, we could think of days as whole numbers, but why not also think of parts of days, like 1.5 days or 3.175 days? So, $$t$$ could be any real number.

Now, letâ€™s figure out the range of $$t$$. The plant started growing 2 days before Pooja bought it, so we could say $$t = -2$$ for that time. She had the plant for 98 days, so the highest $$t$$ would be 98. This means $$t$$ can range from -2 to 98.

The interval for $$t$$ includes -2 (2 days before she got the plant) and goes up to 98. We use square brackets to include these numbers in the interval: $$[-2, 98]$$.

So, $$t$$ belongs to real numbers, and $$t$$ can be between -2 and 98 (including both). We write this as:
$$
-2 \leq t \leq 98
$$

Got it? Great job! Keep going and ask if you have more questions!
