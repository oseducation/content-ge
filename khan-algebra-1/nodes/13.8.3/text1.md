Hey there! Let's work through a math problem together. We're trying to figure out what $$(AX + B)^2$$ is. Go ahead and pause if you want to try it yourself first. Ready? Let's dive in!

We know that squaring something means multiplying it by itself. So $$(AX + B)^2$$ is the same as $$(AX + B) * (AX + B)$$. Let's break it down:

First, let's write it out: $$(AX + B) * (AX + B)$$. When we multiply this out, we need to distribute each term:

1. $$AX * AX = A^2 X^2$$ (here we're squaring the whole $$AX$$ term).
2. $$AX * B = ABX$$.
3. $$B * AX = ABX$$ again.
4. Lastly, $$B * B = B^2$$.

Now, let's put it all together:

- We have $$A^2 X^2$$.
- We have two $$ABX$$ terms, so that gives us $$2ABX$$.
- And we have $$B^2$$.

So, putting it all together: $$(AX + B)^2 = A^2 X^2 + 2ABX + B^2$$.

Now let's take a look at a different example to see this pattern in action. What if we have the trinomial $$25X^2 + 20X + 4$$ and we want to factor it?

First, notice that $$25X^2$$ is a perfect square ($$5X$$ squared) and $$4$$ is a perfect square ($$2$$ squared). Let's check if it fits the pattern we talked about.

For $$(AX + B)^2 = A^2 X^2 + 2ABX + B^2$$:
- Here, $$A = 5$$ and $$B = 2$$.
- So, $$A^2 X^2 = (5X)^2 = 25X^2$$.
- $$B^2$$ is $$2^2 = 4$$.
- For the middle term: $$2ABX = 2 * 5 * 2 * X = 20X$$.

Everything matches! So, $$25X^2 + 20X + 4$$ is a perfect square trinomial. We can factor it as $$(5X + 2)^2$$.

Thatâ€™s the fun part about spotting patterns in math! It makes solving these problems a lot easier. Keep practicing and soon you'll see these patterns quickly too! Great job!
