Hey there!

Let's walk through this story together. Arbegla, feeling pretty upset and embarrassed after being corrected by you and the bird in front of the King, storms out of the room. But just a few seconds later, he comes rushing back in. He admits his mistake and says, "My bad. Sorry about that. I realize now there was a small error in typing or writing. In the first week when they went to the market and bought 2 pounds of apples and 1 pound of bananas, it wasn't $3, it was actually $5."

So now, considering how smart you and the bird seem to be, he challenges you to figure out the cost per pound for apples and bananas. You think about it for a moment. Is there a solution now?

Let's break it down with the same variables we used before. If $$a$$ is the cost per pound of apples and $$b$$ is the cost per pound of bananas, the first bit of information tells us that 2 pounds of apples will cost $$2a$$, and one pound of bananas will cost $$b$$, and this total is actually $5 now.

We also know from the earlier problem that 6 pounds of apples cost $$6a$$ and 3 pounds of bananas cost $$3b$$. The total cost here is given as $15. 

So, you begin to solve it by elimination again. You want to cancel out the $$a$$'s. Here’s the key:

$$
2a + b = 5
$$

$$
6a + 3b = 15
$$

If you multiply the first equation by -3, it will help get rid of the $$a$$'s when you add the equations together:

$$
-3(2a + b) = -3(5)
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
-6a - 3b = -15
$$

Now add this to the second equation:

$$
(-6a - 3b) + (6a + 3b) = -15 + 15
$$

This gives you:

$$
0 = 0
$$

While this is an improvement from the earlier problem (where we got $$0 = 6$$ which didn't make sense), $$0 = 0$$ doesn’t tell us anything useful about $$a$$ and $$b$$.

So, the bird whispers something to the King who then suggests, "The bird says you should try to graph it to see what's really going on." 

Let's graph these two lines. From the first equation:

$$
2a + b = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad b = -2a + 5
$$

From the second equation:

$$
6a + 3b = 15 \quad \text{simplifies to} \quad b = -2a + 5
$$

Wow, both lines are actually the same! So every point on this line is a solution. This means we have an infinite number of solutions. 

The bird then explains to the King that in both trips to the market, the same ratio of apples to bananas was bought. In the green trip and the white trip, you bought three times as many apples and three times as many bananas at three times the cost. 

Basically, this system of equations is consistent, which means there’s no error or trickery. But it’s dependent since we don't have enough information to get specific values for $$a$$ and $$b$$. 

So, you tell Arbegla, "To really figure it out, you need to give us more information, maybe by buying a different ratio of apples to bananas next time."

Hope that clears things up!
