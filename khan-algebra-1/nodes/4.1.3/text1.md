Sure, let's break it down step by step:

"Which of the ordered pairs is a solution of the following equation?" 

We have the equation:

$$4x - 1 = 3y + 5$$

When we look at an ordered pair, we need to remember that the first number is $$x$$ and the second number is $$y$$. If a pair is a solution, it means that when we put $$x$$ and $$y$$ into the equation, both sides should be equal.

Let's check the first pair: $$(3, 2)$$. This means $$x = 3$$ and $$y = 2$$.

Start by replacing $$x$$ and $$y$$ in the equation:

$$4 \cdot 3 - 1 = 3 \cdot 2 + 5$$

Now, let's do the math.

$$4 \cdot 3 = 12$$ so:

$$12 - 1 = 11$$

And on the right side:

$$3 \cdot 2 = 6$$ so:

$$6 + 5 = 11$$

We see that:

$$11 = 11$$

This means that $$(3, 2)$$ is a solution.

Now, let's check the next pair: $$(2, 3)$$. Here, $$x = 2$$ and $$y = 3$$.

Again, replace $$x$$ and $$y$$ in the equation:

$$4 \cdot 2 - 1 = 3 \cdot 3 + 5$$

Do the math for this pair:

$$4 \cdot 2 = 8$$ so:

$$8 - 1 = 7$$

And on the right side:

$$3 \cdot 3 = 9$$ so:

$$9 + 5 = 14$$

But:

$$7 \neq 14$$

This shows that $$(2, 3)$$ is not a solution.

So, only the pair $$(3, 2)$$ is a solution to the equation $$4x - 1 = 3y + 5$$.

I hope this helps you understand how to find solutions for equations with ordered pairs! Feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
