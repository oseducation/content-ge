Sure! Let's chat about this math problem. 

We have a function $$G(x)$$ and we need to find its equation. We know $$F(x) = |x|$$, which is the absolute value of $$x$$. Now, we can see that $$G(x)$$ looks like a stretched or compressed version of $$F(x)$$, and it's also flipped over the X-axis.

Let's try to figure out the equation for $$G(x)$$. 

First, let's flip $$F(x)$$ over the X-axis. We get $$F(x) = -|x|$$. This makes all the $$y$$ values negative instead of positive.

Now, we need to stretch or compress this flipped function. We can see that when $$x = 1$$ in our new green function, it gives $$-1$$, but in $$G(x)$$, it should be $$-4$$. This means $$G(x)$$ is 4 times the value of the green function.

This is true for both positive and negative $$x$$ values. For example, when $$x = -1$$, the green function gives $$-1$$, but $$G(x)$$ should give $$-4$$.

To make this change, we multiply the green function by 4. So, $$G(x) = -4|x|$$. This equation stretches the function down in the vertical direction.

Alternatively, we could first stretch or compress $$F(x)$$ and then flip it. If we stretch $$F(x)$$ first, we get $$4|x|$$. Then, flipping it gives $$-4|x|$$, which is our $$G(x)$$. 

So, the final equation for $$G(x)$$ is:
$$G(x) = -4|x|$$.

I hope that helps!
