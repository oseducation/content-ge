Hi there! Let's go through this step by step.

We have a problem where an object is launched from a platform. The height $$h(x)$$ in meters, $$x$$ seconds after the launch, is given by:
$$h(x) = -5(x-4)^2 + 180$$.

Usually, when we talk about time, we use $$t$$, but here we're using $$x$$. Let's think about what's happening. First, let’s draw an axis for height (h) and time (x). 

At time $$x = 0$$, we're already on a platform, so there's some height. After that, we launch the object. Its path will make a downward curve, called a parabola. 

You might wonder, "How do we know it opens downward?" Well, the formula is a quadratic equation in what's called vertex form, with a negative coefficient in front of the squared term. This makes it a downward-opening parabola.

Now, let's answer a few questions to understand more.

### Question 1: How high is the platform?

To find the platform’s height, we need to calculate $$h(0)$$. That means plugging zero into our equation:
$$h(0) = -5(0-4)^2 + 180$$.

Simplifying:
$$-5(-4)^2 + 180 = -5 \times 16 + 180 = -80 + 180 = 100$$.

So, the platform is 100 meters tall.

### Question 2: When does the object reach its maximum height?

The maximum height in a downward-opening parabola is at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex in this formula is easy to spot. It’s the inside part of the squared term:
$$(x - 4)$$ means the vertex is at $$x = 4$$.

Therefore, the object reaches its maximum height 4 seconds after launch.

### Question 3: When does the object hit the ground?

The object hits the ground when the height $$h(x)$$ is zero. So, we solve:
$$-5(x - 4)^2 + 180 = 0$$.

First, subtract 180 from both sides:
$$-5(x - 4)^2 = -180$$.

Now, divide by -5:
$$(x - 4)^2 = 36$$.

Take the square root of both sides:
$$x - 4 = \pm 6$$.

This gives us two solutions:
$$x - 4 = 6$$ or $$x - 4 = -6$$.

Solving these:
$$x = 10$$ or $$x = -2$$.

Time can’t be negative here, so we disregard $$x = -2$$. Thus, the object hits the ground 10 seconds after launch.

I hope this makes sense! Let me know if you have any questions.
