Sure, let's go through this step by step in a friendly and easy-to-understand way!

First, we have two companies: Company A and Company B. Company A pays $10,000 in the first month, and they increase the payment by $5,000 every month. Company B, on the other hand, pays $500 in the first month but doubles their payment each month. Our goal is to find out when Company B's payment will be higher than Company A's payment for the first time.

Let's make a table to track this information:

| Month | Company A Payment | Company B Payment |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1     | $10,000           | $500              |
| 2     | $15,000           | $1,000            |
| 3     | $20,000           | $2,000            |
| 4     | $25,000           | $4,000            |
| 5     | $30,000           | $8,000            |
| 6     | $35,000           | $16,000           |
| 7     | $40,000           | $32,000           |
| 8     | $45,000           | $64,000           |

From our table, we can see that in the 8th month, Company B's payment ($64,000) is first higher than Company A's payment ($45,000). So, for the first time, Company B's payment will be higher in the 8th month.

There's also an interesting lesson here. Company A's payment grows in a linear way, meaning it increases by the same amount each month (in this case, $5,000). We can say its payment follows the pattern $$a_n = 10,000 + 5,000(n-1)$$ where \( n \) is the month number.

Company B's payment grows exponentially, meaning it doubles every month. This follows the pattern $$b_n = 500 \times 2^{(n-1)}$$

A linear pattern looks like a straight line when you draw it on a graph. An exponential pattern, however, might start smaller, but it will eventually grow much faster than the linear one and surpass it.

So, in conclusion, for which monthly payment will Company B's payment first exceed Company A's payment? It's in the 8th month. This example shows how exponential growth can eventually surpass linear growth, no matter the starting point or rate of increase.

I hope that helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
