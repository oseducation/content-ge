Hey there! Let's chat about the problem you shared. We have three different functions, all named $$f$$, but keep in mind they are different from each other. For each function, we need to:

1. Find the zeros (the input values that make the function equal to zero).
2. Find the vertex coordinates.
3. Find the equation of the line of symmetry (the vertical line that splits the graph into two mirror images).

First, let's start with the zeros. This means we find where the function equals zero.

For the first function, we have:

$$ t - 5^2 - 9 = 0 $$

To solve this:
1. Add 9 to both sides:
   $$ t - 5^2 = 9 $$

2. Take the square root of both sides:
   $$ t - 5 = \pm 3 $$

3. Solve for $$ t $$:
   $$ t = 5 + 3 \quad \text{or} \quad t = 5 - 3 $$
   $$ t = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad t = 2 $$

So, the zeros are at $$ t = 8 $$ and $$ t = 2 $$.

Next, we find the vertex. The vertex is halfway between the zeros:

$$ (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 $$

Now we need to find $$ f(5) $$:
$$ f(5) = (5 - 5)^2 - 9 = -9 $$

So, the vertex is at $$(5, -9)$$.

Now, the line of symmetry is a vertical line through the vertex. Its equation is:

$$ t = 5 $$

Let's sketch the graph. The vertex is at $$(5, -9)$$ and the zeros are $$t = 8$$ and $$t = 2$$. Draw a parabola opening upwards, crossing the $$t$$-axis at these points.

For the second function, set it to zero:

$$ x + 2 \times x + 4 = 0 $$

Solve this:
$$ x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -4 $$

The vertex is halfway between these:

$$ (-2 + (-4)) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3 $$

Find $$ f(-3) $$:
$$ f(-3) = (-3 + 2) \times (-3 + 4) = -1 $$

So, the vertex is $(-3, -1)$$ and the line of symmetry is:

$$ x = -3 $$

Now, sketch this too, with zeros at $$ -2 $$ and $$ -4 $$ and vertex at $$(-3, -1)$$.

Lastly, for the third function, set:

$$ x^2 + 6x + 8 = 0 $$

Factor it:
$$ (x + 2)(x + 4) = 0 $$

The solutions are the same as the second function:
$$ x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -4 $$

So, the vertex, zeros, and line of symmetry are the same as the second function because they are the same function written differently.

I hope that helps! Feel free to practice more or ask any questions you have.
