Sure! Let's go through this step by step in a friendly and simple way.

Hey there! Today, we're going to take a look at a quadratic expression: $$x^2 - 3x - 10$$. What we want to do is factor this into two binomials. In simple terms, we want to rewrite it in the form of $$(x + a)(x + b)$$, where we need to find out what $$a$$ and $$b$$ are. 

Feel free to pause and try to figure it out on your own first!

Alright, let's do this together. I'll use different colors to make it easier: yellow for $$a$$ and magenta for $$b$$. 

To start, let's multiply $$(x + a)(x + b)$$ and see what we get:
- $$x \cdot x$$ makes $$x^2$$.
- $$a \cdot x$$ gives us $$ax$$.
- $$x \cdot b$$ gives us $$bx$$.
- Finally, $$a \cdot b$$ gives us $$ab$$.

So, when we write it all out, we get:

$$x^2 + ax + bx + ab$$.

Now, let’s simplify it:

$$x^2 + (a + b)x + ab$$.

Next, let’s match this result with our original quadratic expression, $$x^2 - 3x - 10$$:
- We see that $$x^2$$ stays the same.
- The term with $$x$$ is $$(a + b)x$$, which must match $$-3x$$. So, $$a + b = -3$$.
- The constant term is $$ab$$, which must match $$-10$$. So, $$a \cdot b = -10$$.

So, we need two numbers that add up to $$-3$$ and multiply to $$-10$$.

Think about what those numbers could be:
- From the factors of $$10$$, we have $$1 \cdot 10$$ or $$2 \cdot 5$$. 
- Let’s try $$2$$ and $$5$$. If one is negative and one is positive, their difference can be $$3$$.

So, let’s pick:
- $$a = 2$$ and $$b = -5$$.

Check:
$$2 \cdot (-5) = -10$$ and $$2 + (-5) = -3$$.

Perfect! Our values for $$a$$ and $$b$$ work.

Therefore, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as:

$$(x + 2)(x - 5)$$.

And that's it! We've successfully factored it as the product of two binomials. 

Remember, when you see a quadratic expression like this one, you just need to find two numbers that add to the coefficient of the $$x$$ term and multiply to the constant term. 

Great job! If you need help with anything else, just let me know!
