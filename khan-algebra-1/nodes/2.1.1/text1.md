Sure! Let's discuss this step by step and make it clear:

So, we have an interesting problem here. We are dealing with a balance scale that has the same mystery mass, which we call $$Y$$, on both sides. This shows that we can use any letter for the unknown as long as we can keep track of it. Both sides also have some 1-kilogram boxes. Our goal is to find out the value of this mystery mass $$Y$$.

First, let's see if we can write this out using math. On the left side of the scale, there are three $$Ys$$ and three 1-kilogram boxes. On the right side, there is one $$Y$$ and seven 1-kilogram boxes. So, let's write that in math terms:

- Left side: $$3Y + 3$$ (3 $$Ys$$ and 3 boxes)
- Right side: $$Y + 7$$ (1 $$Y$$ and 7 boxes)

Since the scale is balanced, the total mass on both sides should be equal. We can write:

$$3Y + 3 = Y + 7$$

Now, let's think about how we simplify this to find $$Y$$. First, we can remove $$Y$$ from both sides to try to put all $$Ys$$ on one side. If we subtract $$Y$$ from both sides, we get:

$$3Y - Y + 3 = Y - Y + 7$$

This simplifies to:

$$2Y + 3 = 7$$

Next, we want to get rid of the 3 on the left side to isolate $$Y$$. So, we subtract 3 from both sides:

$$2Y + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3$$

This simplifies to:

$$2Y = 4$$

We now want to find the value of one $$Y$$, so we divide both sides by 2:

$$\frac{2Y}{2} = \frac{4}{2}$$

This simplifies to:

$$Y = 2$$

So, the mystery mass $$Y$$ is 2 kilograms. 

To check our work, let's substitute $$Y = 2$$ back into our original problem to see if both sides are equal. 

- On the left side: $$3Y + 3 = 3(2) + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9$$
- On the right side: $$Y + 7 = 2 + 7 = 9$$

Both sides equal 9 kilograms, so our solution is correct. The balance stays balanced, and we found that $$Y = 2$$ kilograms. Great job!
