Sure! Let's go through this step by step together.

Hannah and Martine each got a plant for their home. Hannah's plant grows 2 centimeters per week. Martine's plant grows 3 millimeters per day. We need to figure out which plant grows faster. 

At first, you might look at the numbers 3 and 2 and think that Martine's plant grows faster because 3 is larger than 2. However, the units are different. Hannah’s plant growth is in centimeters per week, while Martine’s plant is in millimeters per day. To compare them correctly, we need to convert the units so they are the same.

Let's convert both of them to centimeters per week since we already have Hannah's plant growth in those units.

Hannah’s plant grows $$2 \text{ centimeters per week}$$.

Martine’s plant grows $$3 \text{ millimeters per day}$$.

First, we need to convert days into weeks. There are 7 days in a week. So, to find out how many millimeters per week Martine's plant grows, we multiply:
$$3 \, \text{millimeters/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 21 \, \text{millimeters/week}$$.

Now, 1 centimeter equals 10 millimeters. To convert 21 millimeters into centimeters, we divide by 10:
$$21 \, \text{millimeters} \div 10 = 2.1 \, \text{centimeters} \, \text{per week}$$.

So, Martine’s plant grows $$2.1 \, \text{centimeters per week}$$.

Now, we compare:
Hannah’s plant: $$2 \, \text{centimeters per week}$$.
Martine’s plant: $$2.1 \, \text{centimeters per week}$$.

Martine’s plant grows just a bit faster than Hannah’s plant because $$2.1 > 2$$.

Great job! Always remember to check and convert your units so you can make accurate comparisons.
