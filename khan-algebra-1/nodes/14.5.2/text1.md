Hey! Let's solve this Math problem together. We have the equation:

$$6x^2 - 120x + 600 = 0$$

Take a moment to see if you can find the $$x$$ values that satisfy this equation. If you're ready, let's dive in together.

First, let's simplify things a bit. These numbers look manageable and maybe we can factor them. To make our job easier, let's see if all the terms are divisible by 6. If we divide both sides of the equation by 6, we get:

$$ \frac{6x^2}{6} - \frac{120x}{6} + \frac{600}{6} = \frac{0}{6} $$

Simplifying this, we get:

$$x^2 - 20x + 100 = 0$$

Next, we'll try to factor this quadratic equation. We want to express it as a product of two expressions, like $$(x + a)(x + b)$$. Let's expand this:

$$(x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + (a + b)x + ab$$

We need to find $$a$$ and $$b$$ such that:

1. $$a + b = -20$$ 
2. $$ab = 100$$

Since the product is positive and the sum is negative, both numbers must be negative. Let's think of pairs of negative numbers whose product is 100 and sum is -20. A good pair would be:

$$ -10 \times -10 = 100$$

and

$$-10 + (-10) = -20$$

So, we can factor the quadratic as:

$$ (x - 10)(x - 10) = 0 $$

This can also be written as:

$$ (x - 10)^2 = 0 $$

To solve this, we see that the only way for the left side to be zero is if:

$$ x - 10 = 0 $$

Adding 10 to both sides, we get:

$$ x = 10 $$

So, the solution to our equation is:

$$ x = 10 $$
