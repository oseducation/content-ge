Sure, I'd be happy to help you understand this problem. Let’s break it down together.

Fabiano wants to score at least 6.5 points in a chess tournament. He gets 1 point for each game he wins, and 0.5 points for each game that ends in a draw.

We need to write an inequality that shows how many games Fabiano should win, which we’ll call $$W$$, and how many he should draw, which we’ll call $$D$$, to meet his goal.

Let’s start with the points from winning. If he wins $$W$$ games, and each win gives him 1 point, then his points from winning are $$W$$. 

Next, let’s look at the points from draws. If he draws $$D$$ games, and each draw gives him 0.5 points, then his points from draws are $$0.5D$$.

So, his total points will be the points from wins plus the points from draws. That gives us:

$$
W + 0.5D
$$

He wants this total to be at least 6.5 points, so we write:

$$
W + 0.5D \geq 6.5
$$

This inequality shows the combination of wins and draws Fabiano needs to score at least 6.5 points in the tournament.

Great job working through this! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
