Sure, let's walk through it step-by-step. Here’s how we can rewrite the process of factoring $$-4t^2 - 12t - 9$$ in simpler terms:

First, let's see if there's any number we can divide out from all the parts of $$-4t^2 - 12t - 9$$.

- The first number, $$-4t^2$$, can be divided by 4.
- The second number, $$-12t$$, can be divided by 4.
- The last one, $$-9$$, can't be divided by 4, but it can be divided by 3.

Since there's no single number that all three can be divided by, the biggest thing we can factor out is $$-1$$. So we start by doing that:

$$-1 \times (4t^2 + 12t + 9)$$

Now we have $$4t^2 + 12t + 9$$ inside the parentheses. Can we factor this part further? Yes! Let’s look closely.

A helpful approach here is to think about perfect squares. A perfect square is something like $$(a + b)^2$$.

Let's see if $$4t^2 + 12t + 9$$ fits the perfect square pattern $$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$.

1. $$4t^2$$: This looks like a perfect square ($$a^2$$). So, $$a$$ could be $$2t$$.
2. The middle term $$12t$$: For it to match $$2ab$$, we should have $$2 \times 2t \times b = 12t$$. Solving for $$b$$, we get $$b = 3$$.
3. The last term $$9$$: This is also a perfect square ($$b^2$$). So, $$b$$ is $$3$$.

This means $$4t^2 + 12t + 9$$ fits the pattern $$(2t + 3)^2$$:

So, we can rewrite:
$$-1 \times 4t^2 + 12t + 9 = -1 \times (2t + 3)^2$$

Therefore, the factored form is:
$$- (2t + 3)^2$$

This gives us a much simpler way to look at things, breaking down a complex problem into smaller, easier pieces. So, by seeing that the expression fits a perfect square, we saved some time and made the process easier!
