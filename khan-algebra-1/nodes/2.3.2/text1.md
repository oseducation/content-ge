Sure! Let's break this down and solve it together. Iâ€™ll use simple words and keep things clear.

We want to solve for \( x \). The equation given is:

\[ 8 \times (3x + 10) = 28x - 14 - 4x \]

First, we need to simplify each side. On the left side, we use the distributive property, which means we multiply \( 8 \) by everything inside the parentheses. So,

\[ 8 \times 3x + 8 \times 10 = 24x + 80 \]

Now, we have:

\[ 24x + 80 \]

On the right side of the equation, we need to combine like terms. We have \( 28x \) and \( -4x \):

\[ 28x - 4x = 24x \]

So now, the equation looks like this:

\[ 24x + 80 = 24x - 14 \]

Next, let's get all the \( x \) terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. To do that, we can subtract \( 24x \) from both sides:

\[ 24x + 80 - 24x = 24x - 14 - 24x \]

When we do this, the \( 24x \) cancels out on both sides:

\[ 80 = -14 \]

This tells us something is strange because \( 80 \) is clearly not equal to \( -14 \). 

So, what does this mean? It means there is no value of \( x \) that can make this equation true. In other words, this equation has no solution. Thereâ€™s no number that will work here!

Hope that clears things up! ðŸ˜Š
