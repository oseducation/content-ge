Hey there! To help you understand how to factor second-degree expressions, let's walk through a couple of examples together. We'll factor two different expressions and try to make it clear how you can generally go about factoring expressions like these.

First, let's think about what happens if we multiply $$(x + \text{something}) \cdot (x + \text{something else})$$. When we multiply this out, we get $$x^2 + ax + bx$$, which is the same as $$(a + b)x + ab$$. So, if we want to go from the form we have in these examples back to this factored form, we need to think about two things:
1. What is the coefficient on the $$x$$ term, and can we find two numbers that add up to it?
2. What is the constant term, and can these same two numbers multiply to give this constant term?

Let's apply this to our examples.

For the first example, look at the coefficient on the $$x$$ term. We'll try to find two numbers, $$a$$ and $$b$$, that add up to this coefficient and also multiply to give the constant term. Our coefficient here is $$-14$$, and our constant term is $$40$$. 

We need to find two numbers that add up to $$-14$$ and multiply to $$40$$. Let's think:
- If we try $$4$$ and $$10$$, we get $$4 \cdot 10 = 40$$, but $$4 + 10 = 14$$, which is not what we want. 
- What if we make both numbers negative? $$-4 + -10$$ is indeed $$-14$$, and $$-4 \cdot -10 = 40$$. This works because a positive product of $$40$$ with a negative sum of $$-14$$ tells us both numbers should be negative.

So, for our expression, $$a = -4$$ and $$b = -10$$. Our factored form is:
$$(x + (-4))(x + (-10))$$ or more simply, $$(x - 4)(x - 10)$$.

For the second example, we need $$a + b$$ to equal the coefficient on the $$x$$ term, which is $$-1$$, and $$a \cdot b$$ to equal the constant term, which is $$-12$$. 

Let's think again:
- The product of the two numbers is negative, meaning one number is positive and the other is negative.
- If we try $$3$$ and $$-4$$, we get $$3 - 4 = -1$$ and $$3 \cdot (-4) = -12$$, which works!

So, for this expression, we have $$a = 3$$ and $$b = -4$$. Our factored form is:
$$(x + 3)(x + (-4))$$ or simply, $$(x + 3)(x - 4)$$.

And that's how you factor these expressions! By thinking about the sums and products of pairs of numbers, you can find the ones that work and write your second-degree expression in its factored form. I hope this makes it clearer for you! If you have any more questions or want more practice, feel free to ask.
