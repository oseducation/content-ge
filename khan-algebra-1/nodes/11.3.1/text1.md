Sure! Let's go through this step by step together and simplify it. 

First, let's look at $$5 \times \sqrt{117}$$. The number 117 doesn’t look like a perfect square, so let's figure out its prime factors. Since 117 is odd, it isn’t divisible by 2. To check if it’s divisible by 3, add its digits: $$1 + 1 + 7 = 9$$, which is divisible by 3. 

Now, let’s divide 117 by 3:
- 3 doesn’t go into 1.
- 3 goes into 11 three times (3 × 3 = 9). Subtract 9 from 11 to get a remainder of 2.
- Bring down the 7 to make 27. 3 goes into 27 nine times (3 × 9 = 27).

So, $$117 \div 3 = 39$$. We can write 117 as $$3 \times 39$$.

Next, let’s break down 39:
- 39 is also divisible by 3. $$39 \div 3 = 13$$.

So, we can write 39 as $$3 \times 13$$. Therefore, 117 can be written as $$3 \times 3 \times 13$$.

Now, we have $$5 \times \sqrt{3 \times 3 \times 13}$$. This can be written as:
$$5 \times \sqrt{3 \times 3} \times \sqrt{13}$$.

The square root of $$3 \times 3$$ is 3, so:
$$\sqrt{3 \times 3} = 3$$.

This simplifies our expression to:
$$5 \times 3 \times \sqrt{13} = 15 \times \sqrt{13}$$.

Let's also simplify $$3 \times \sqrt{26}$$:

26 is even, so it’s divisible by 2. We can write 26 as $$2 \times 13$$.

Since 13 is a prime number, it can't be broken down further. 26 doesn’t have any perfect squares, so there's nothing more we can do to simplify it. 

So, we leave it as:
$$3 \times \sqrt{26}$$.
