Sure! Let’s break it down and make it a bit easier to understand. We’ll solve for $$x$$ in this compound inequality:

$$-16 \leq 3x + 5 \leq 20$$

There are two main ways to solve it, and they’re essentially the same. I’ll go through both at the same time.

One way is to solve the compound inequality all at once. Here it is again:

$$-16 \leq 3x + 5 \leq 20$$

The other way is to split it into two separate inequalities that both need to be true:

$$-16 \leq 3x + 5$$ 

and

$$3x + 5 \leq 20$$

These two approaches are equivalent. The second method might look more familiar because you can solve each inequality separately and keep both in mind. The first method has three parts but works the same way.

We want to isolate $$x$$, so we’ll start by getting rid of the $$5$$ in the middle. We do this by subtracting $$5$$ from every part:

$$-16 - 5 \leq 3x + 5 - 5 \leq 20 - 5$$

This simplifies to:

$$-21 \leq 3x \leq 15$$

We do the same with the two separate inequalities:

$$-16 - 5 \leq 3x + 5 - 5$$ 

$$3x + 5 - 5 \leq 20 - 5$$

Both simplify to:

$$-21 \leq 3x$$ 

and

$$3x \leq 15$$

So now we have:

$$-21 \leq 3x \leq 15$$

Next, to isolate $$x$$, we divide everything by $$3$$. Since $$3$$ is positive, we don’t change the inequality signs:

$$-21 / 3 \leq 3x / 3 \leq 15 / 3$$

This simplifies to:

$$-7 \leq x \leq 5$$

So, $$x$$ is between $$-7$$ and $$5$$, including both $$-7$$ and $$5$$.

If we want to show this solution on a number line, it looks like this:

- Draw a number line.
- Mark and fill in circles at $$-7$$ and $$5$$.
- Shade the line between $$-7$$ and $$5$$.

To check that our solution works, pick numbers in and out of our solution range:

- Try $$0$$: $$3 \cdot 0 + 5 = 5$$ which works because $$ -16 \leq 5 \leq 20$$.
- Try $$5$$: $$3 \cdot 5 + 5 = 20$$ which works because $$ -16 \leq 20 \leq 20$$.
- Try $$-7$$: $$3 \cdot -7 + 5 = -16$$ which works because $$ -16 \leq -16 \leq 20$$.
- Try $$10$$: $$3 \cdot 10 + 5 = 35$$ which doesn’t work because $$ 35 \not\leq 20$$.

That’s it! We’ve solved for $$x$$ and checked that our solution is correct. Great job!
