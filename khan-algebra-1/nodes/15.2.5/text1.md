Sure, let’s break this down step by step together! We’re going to figure out if each expression is a rational or irrational number. Just a quick reminder: 

- A rational number can be written as the ratio of two whole numbers (like $$\frac{m}{n}$$, where both $$m$$ and $$n$$ are whole numbers).
- An irrational number cannot be expressed that way.

Okay, let’s look at the first example:

**Number 9:**
- 9 is clearly rational because you can write it as $$\frac{9}{1}$$, $$\frac{18}{2}$$, or $$\frac{27}{3}$$. All these show 9 as a ratio of two whole numbers.

**Square Root of 45:**
- Let's break down $$\sqrt{45}$$. This is the same as $$\sqrt{9 \cdot 5}$$, which we can split into $$\sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{5}$$.
- $$\sqrt{9}$$ is 3, so we get $$3 \cdot \sqrt{5}$$. 
- $$\sqrt{5}$$ is irrational (since 5 isn’t a perfect square).
- Multiplying a rational (3) by an irrational ($$\sqrt{5}$$) gives us an irrational number.
- Adding 9 (rational) to this irrational number still gives us an irrational number.
- So, $$9 + 3 \cdot \sqrt{5}$$ is irrational.

**Expression with fractions:**
- Consider $$\frac{\sqrt{45}}{3 \cdot \sqrt{5}}$$.
- Let's simplify: $$\sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{5} = 3 \cdot \sqrt{5}$$.
- Now, we write it as $$\frac{3 \cdot \sqrt{5}}{3 \cdot \sqrt{5}}$$.
- This simplifies to 1 (since anything divided by itself is 1).
- 1 can be written as $$\frac{1}{1}$$, $$\frac{2}{2}$$, $$\frac{3}{3}$$, and so on. Hence, it's rational.

**Last expression:**
- We have $$3 \cdot \sqrt{9}$$.
- The principal root of 9 ($$\sqrt{9}$$) is 3.
- So, $$3 \cdot 3$$ equals 9.
- As we already discussed, 9 is rational since it can be expressed as $$\frac{9}{1}$$, $$\frac{27}{3}$$, etc.
