I'm here to talk about an interesting idea brought up by Jesse Ro, a math teacher at Summit San Jose, who is also a Khan Academy teaching fellow. Jesse mentioned a question that students often ask when they start learning Algebra: **"Why do we use letters? Why can't we just use numbers for everything?"** Let's think about that together.

**Why Letters?**

Well, why do we have all these Xs, Ys, and Zs in Algebra? Here are a couple of ways to understand it:

### 1. **Unknown Values**
One reason is when we have an unknown value. If we write **X + 3 = 10**, we use **X** because we don't know what **X** is yet. 

- **X** is an unknown number.
- We need a symbol to represent this unknown number.

But we don't have to use the letter **X**. We could use any symbol. For example:
- **Blank + 3 = 10**
- **Question Mark + 3 = 10**

We can even use something fun, like:
- **Smiley Face + 3 = 10**

Until we solve it, it's just a symbol representing the unknown number.

### 2. **Describing Relationships**
Another reason we use letters is to describe relationships between numbers. For example:

- Suppose I say: "Whenever you give me a 3, I'll give you a 4. If you give me a 5, I'll give you a 6." 
- This could go on forever: "If you give me a 7.1, I'll give you an 8.1."

It would take too long to list all these pairs. Instead, we can use letters to show the relationship. 

- Let’s call what you give me **X** and what I give back **Y**.
- I can now say: "Whatever **X** you give me, I’ll add 1 to it and give you back **Y**."

**Y = X + 1**

This simple equation describes an endless number of **X** and **Y** pairs:

- If **X** is 3, then **Y** is 4.
- If **X** is 7.1, then **Y** is 8.1.

There's no simpler way to show this than by using symbols.

### **Why X and Y?**

We use **X** and **Y** because it's a common tradition in math. But we could use any symbols, like:
- **Star** for what you give me.
- **Smiley Face** for what I give you back.

These symbols are just placeholders for the numbers. Nothing more.

By using letters in Algebra, we can solve equations with unknowns and describe relationships between numbers in a clear and simple way!
