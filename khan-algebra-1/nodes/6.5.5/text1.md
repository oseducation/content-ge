Sure! Let's chat about this step by step.

We're asked to look at a coordinate grid. Imagine you have it in front of you. We need to find:

1. A pair of lines that meet at one point (one solution).
2. A pair of lines that don't meet at all (no solution).

Let's start with the first one, finding a pair of lines with one solution. 

When we say "one solution," we're looking for a pair of lines that cross at exactly one point. This point gives us a single $$x$$ and $$y$$ value that makes both lines’ equations true. 

Look at the points where lines cross each other. One crossing point you might see satisfies these two equations:

$$y = 0.1x + 1$$ (this line is shown in one color)  
$$y = 4x + 10$$ (this line is shown in another color)

At that crossing point (or intersection), the $$x$$ and $$y$$ values fit both equations. That means we’ve found one system of lines with one solution.

Even though we only need to find one, there's another pair of lines that also has one solution. Look at another point where two different lines meet. One of these lines is:

$$y = 0.1x + 1$$ (same as before)

And the other one is:

$$y = 4x - 6$$

Again, at their crossing point, there's a pair of $$x$$ and $$y$$ values that work for both equations.

Now, let's move to the second part: finding a pair of lines with no solution.

Two lines that don't meet at all are parallel lines. No matter how far you extend them, they never touch. For example, look at these parallel lines:

$$y = 4x + 10$$  
$$y = 4x - 6$$  

They have the same slope (which means they go up or down at the same angle), but they start at different points (different intercepts). Because of that, they never cross each other. So, there's no $$x$$ and $$y$$ pair that fits both lines' equations.

That's it! We found:

1. A system with one solution: where the lines $$y = 0.1x + 1$$ and $$y = 4x + 10$$ meet.
2. A system with no solution: where the parallel lines $$y = 4x + 10$$ and $$y = 4x - 6$$ never meet.

I hope that clears things up! Feel free to ask if anything is still confusing.
