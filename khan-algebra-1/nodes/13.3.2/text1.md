Sure! Let's walk through this step-by-step.

Hi there! Let's figure out what $$(x + 7)^2$$ is. First, I want you to take a moment and try to work it out on your own.

Great! Now, let’s work through it together. Remember, when we’re squaring a whole binomial, it’s just like doing $$(x + 7) \times (x + 7)$$. I’ll write the second $$(x + 7)$$ in a different color to help us keep track.

So, we can multiply these together like we would with any binomials. We’ll start by using the distributive property twice. Let’s take the yellow $$(x + 7)$$ and distribute it over the magenta $$(x + 7)$$.

First, distribute the yellow $$(x + 7)$$ to the magenta $$x$$:
$$x \times (x + 7) + 7 \times (x + 7)$$.

Now we can break it down further by using the distributive property again:
$$x \times x + x \times 7 + 7 \times x + 7 \times 7 = x^2 + 7x + 7x + 49$$.

Next, we add the middle terms:
$$x^2 + 7x + 7x + 49 = x^2 + 14x + 49$$.

And we're done! Now, let’s see if we can spot any patterns to square binomials faster in the future.

When we multiply $$(x + a) \times (x + b)$$, we get:
$$x^2 + (a + b)x + ab$$.

If both $$a$$ and $$b$$ are the same, say $$a$$, then it looks like:
$$(x + a) \times (x + a) = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$$.

This pattern helps us square binomials quickly. In our example, $$a$$ is 7:
$$x^2 + 2 \cdot 7 \cdot x + 7^2 = x^2 + 14x + 49$$.

Here, the $$x^2$$ fits, and $$14x$$ is $$2 \cdot 7 \cdot x$$, and $$7^2$$ is 49.

So, whenever you square a binomial, use this pattern. Let’s try another example with a negative:
$$(x - 3)^2$$.

Using the pattern, here $$a$$ is -3:
$$x^2 + 2 \cdot (-3) \cdot x + (-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$$.

You see, it’s quick and easy! Always double-check with the distributive property if you’re unsure, but this method saves time.

Hope this helps! Keep practicing, and it will become second nature!
