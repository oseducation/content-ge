Hey there! Let's talk about how the value of \( y \) changes with \( x \).

The value of \( y \) is always 3 more than twice \( x \). So, we can say that \( y \) is equal to 3 more than twice \( x \). In other words, we can write it as $$ y = 3 + 2x $$.

Now, let's figure out if \( y \) is a function of \( x \). When we ask if something is a function of something else, we are really asking, "For any input \( x \), does it map to exactly one \( y \)?"

If we say \( y \) is a function of \( x \), it means that for any \( x \) you put into this function, you should get exactly one \( y \). If you put in an \( x \), you must get one and only one \( y \) value. If you get two different values, then it is not a function anymore.

So, in simpler terms, for any input \( x \), you get exactly one output \( y \). You can have two different \( x \) values that give the same \( y \), but you can't have one \( x \) value that gives you two different \( y \) values.

Looking at our equation $$ y = 3 + 2x $$, it's clear that for any input \( x \), you get a unique output \( y \). If \( x \) is 0, \( y \) is 3. If \( x \) is 1, \( y \) is 5. So, yes, \( y \) is definitely a function of \( x \).

Hope that helps!
