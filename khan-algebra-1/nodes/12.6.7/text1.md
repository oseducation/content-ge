Hey there! Let's break this down together in simpler terms. So, Sarah Swift got a speeding ticket. If she pays it right away, there's no extra charge. But if she waits, she'll have to pay a penalty for each month she delays. The table below shows how much sheâ€™ll owe depending on the number of months $$t$$ she delays. This data follows a pattern called an "exponential function."

An exponential function looks like this:

$$
F(t) = a \cdot r^t
$$

where $$a$$ is a starting amount, $$r$$ is a common ratio, and $$t$$ is the number of months delayed.

### Figuring Out the Common Ratio
To find the common ratio, we look at the amounts listed for each month. The ratio $$r$$ between any two consecutive months should be the same. 

For example, the ratio of the fine in month 2 to the fine in month 1 is:
$$
\frac{450}{300} = 1.5
$$

Similarly, for other consecutive months:
$$
\frac{675}{450} = 1.5 \\
\frac{1012.5}{675} = 1.5
$$

So, the common ratio $$r$$ is 1.5.

### Formula for the Function
Next, we need to find the starting amount $$a$$. We know from the table that when $$t = 1$$, the fine $$F(1) = 300$$. 

Using the formula:
$$
F(1) = a \cdot 1.5^1 = 300
$$

We solve for $$a$$:
$$
1.5 \cdot a = 300 \\
a = \frac{300}{1.5} = 200
$$

So, our full formula now is:
$$
F(t) = 200 \cdot 1.5^t
$$

### Fine if Paid on Time
If she pays on time (which means $$t = 0$$), we need to find $$F(0)$$. 

Using our formula:
$$
F(0) = 200 \cdot 1.5^0 = 200 \cdot 1 = 200 \text{ euros}
$$

### Another Way to See It
If we reverse the process, going backward one month means dividing by the common ratio. So, from:
- 675 to 450, divide by 1.5
- 450 to 300, divide by 1.5
- 300 to 200, divide by 1.5

Every step backward divides by the common ratio, which confirms that the fine on time (at $$t = 0$$) is 200 euros.
