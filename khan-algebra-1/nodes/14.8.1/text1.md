Hey there! Let's solve this equation together. We have $$x^2 - 8x + 1 = 85$$. First, let's try to complete the square. Trust me, it sounds more complex than it is, but we’ll break it down together.

1. Start with writing the equation like this: 
$$x^2 - 8x + 1 = 85$$.

2. Move the 1 to the other side so we focus on the $$x$$ terms:
$$x^2 - 8x = 85 - 1$$
or 
$$x^2 - 8x = 84$$.

3. To complete the square, add and subtract the same number. We look at the coefficient of $$x$$, which is -8. Take half of it (-4) and square it (16):
$$x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16 = 84$$,
which simplifies to:
$$x^2 - 8x + 16 = 100$$.

4. Now, the left side is a perfect square:
$$(x - 4)^2 = 100$$.

5. To solve for $$x$$, we take the square root of both sides, remembering that it can be positive or negative:
$$x - 4 = \pm 10$$.

6. This gives us two possible equations:
$$x - 4 = 10 \text{ or } x - 4 = -10$$.

7. Solving these:
$$x = 14$$ or $$x = -6$$.

So, the solutions are $$x = 14$$ and $$x = -6$$.

There’s also another method – making the equation equal to zero and factoring.

1. Start with:
$$x^2 - 8x + 1 - 85 = 0$$ 
or
$$x^2 - 8x - 84 = 0$$.

2. Now let's factor this. We need two numbers that multiply to -84 and add to -8. They are 6 and -14:
$$(x + 6)(x - 14) = 0$$.

3. This gives us:
$$x + 6 = 0$$ or $$x - 14 = 0$$,
which simplifies to:
$$x = -6$$ or $$x = 14$$.

Both ways give us the same solutions, $$x = 14$$ and $$x = -6$$. Good job working through this!
