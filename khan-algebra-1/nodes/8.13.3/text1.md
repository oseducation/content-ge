Hi there! Let's chat about understanding the inverses of functions. Imagine we're doing a fun exercise from Khan Academy that helps us get how these inverses work. It's interactive, letting us play around with a line to discover more.

First, the graph of $$h(x)$$ is shown as a dotted green line. We are asked to drag the endpoints of this segment to graph $$h^{-1}(x)$$ (the inverse of $$h(x)$$). 

One way to start is to look at what $$h(x)$$ does. For example:

- If you put in -8 into $$h(x)$$, the output is 1. That means $$h(-8) = 1$$. 
- For the inverse, $$h^{-1}(x)$$, you would switch the input and output. So, $$h^{-1}(1) = -8$$. We plot this point (1, -8) on the graph.
- On the other end, if you put 3 into $$h(x)$$, the output is -4. That means $$h(3) = -4$$.
- For the inverse, you switch again, so $$h^{-1}(-4) = 3$$. We plot this point (-4, 3) on the graph.

By plotting these two inverse points, we've mapped out the inverse of the line segment. 

Another way to think about inverses is to use the line $$y = x$$. The original function and its inverse are reflections across this line because swapping the x's and y's means flipping points over this line. If you draw the line $$y = x$$, the green line will flip over to show the inverse line.

So, weâ€™ve finished graphing $$h^{-1}(x)$$! Great job!
