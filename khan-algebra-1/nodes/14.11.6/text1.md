Hey there! Let's go through this step by step together. So, Taylor opened a restaurant, and the net value of the restaurant (in thousands of dollars) $$t$$ months after it opened is given by the function $$v(t) = 2t^2 - 20t$$. Taylor wants to find the lowest net value of the restaurant and when it will happen. Let's break this down!

First, let's understand the function that tells us the net value of the restaurant over time. If we were to graph it, because the coefficient of the $$t^2$$ term is positive, it would be an upward-opening parabola. This means there's a point (the vertex) where the net value would reach its lowest. Let's figure out what that point is.

We want to rewrite the function in a way that makes this low point, or vertex, easy to see. The method we'll use is called "completing the square." 

First, let's factor out the 2 from both terms inside the function:
$$
v(t) = 2(t^2 - 10t)
$$

Next, to "complete the square," we need to make this a perfect square expression. We take half of the coefficient of $$t$$ (which is -10), square it, and then add and subtract this square:

Half of -10 is -5, and (-5)^2 is 25. So we add and subtract 25 inside the parentheses:
$$
v(t) = 2(t^2 - 10t + 25 - 25) = 2((t - 5)^2 - 25)
$$

Now multiply through by the 2, remembering we factored it out earlier:
$$
v(t) = 2(t - 5)^2 - 50
$$

This is called the vertex form of the quadratic function. It's easy to see that the lowest point (the vertex) happens when $$t = 5$$, because the squared term $$(t - 5)^2$$ is 0 at $$t = 5$$. The function reaches its lowest value when $$t = 5$$. 

Let's calculate the minimum value:
$$
v(5) = 2(5 - 5)^2 - 50
$$

That's:
$$
v(5) = 2 \times 0 - 50 = -50
$$

So, the restaurant reaches its lowest net value 5 months after opening, and this lowest value is -50 (which means -$50,000 since the values are in thousands of dollars).

You might wonder how you can have a negative value. Imagine the restaurant building is worth $50,000, but it owes $100,000. The net value would be -$50,000.

I hope that clarifies things! Feel free to ask if anything's still unclear! ðŸ˜Š
