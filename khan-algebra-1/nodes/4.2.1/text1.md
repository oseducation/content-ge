Hey there! As we start to look at graphs of lines, we might notice that some lines look different from others. Like, this magenta (pink) line here looks steeper compared to the blue one. The idea of how steep a line is, or how quickly it goes up or down, is super helpful in Math. It would be great if we could give a number to each line to show how steep it is. So, how do we do that? 

Well, one way to think about it is to look at how much a line goes up in the vertical direction for a certain amount it goes sideways (horizontal direction). Letâ€™s write this down:

$$ \text{Increase in vertical direction for a given increase in horizontal direction} $$

Let's look at the magenta line again. If we start at a point that's easy to figure out, say here, and move one step to the right (horizontal direction), how much do we have to move up (vertical direction) to stay on the line? We move up by 2.

So, for this line, every time we move one step to the right, we move up by 2. Now, if we start at a different point and move 3 steps to the right, how much do we move up? We move up by 6. So, moving 3 steps sideways means moving 6 steps up. 

If we compare these:

$$ \frac{2}{1} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{6}{3} = 2 $$

It shows that no matter where we start, if we move a certain amount to the right, we will always move up twice that amount. This idea of how much we go up for a given rightwards move is called the "slope."

The slope of a line helps us understand how steep the line is. For example, the slope of the magenta line is 2. This means for every step you take to the right, you go up 2 steps.

Now, let's find the slope of the blue line. For the blue line, if we move 2 steps to the right, how much do we move up? We move up by 2 steps. So:

$$ \text{Slope of blue line} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 $$

This means however much we increase the horizontal direction, the vertical direction increases by the same amount. If we go 1 step to the right, we go 1 step up. The same thing happens no matter where you start on the line. 

Even if we go backward (like decreasing \( x \)), the change in \( y \) will be the same amount backward. 

So, in short, the slope helps us see how steep a line is, and it tells us how the vertical change compares to the horizontal change. The magenta line has a slope of 2, and the blue line has a slope of 1. Thatâ€™s why the magenta one is steeper!

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have more questions! ðŸŒŸ
