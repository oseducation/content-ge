Sure! Let's break this down together.

We're asked to graph an equation: $$y = 5x^2 - 20x + 15$$.

First, let's write it on our scratch pad: $$y = 5x^2 - 20x + 15$$. 

There are different ways to graph this. One method is to pick three values for $$x$$, find their corresponding $$y$$ values, and plot these three points. This will help us draw the parabola.

But let's do something a bit more interesting. We’ll find where this parabola intersects the x-axis first. 

Imagining our axes:
- x-axis (horizontal)
- y-axis (vertical)

We want to know where the curve intersects the x-axis. This happens where $$y = 0$$ in our equation. So we're solving:
$$5x^2 - 20x + 15 = 0$$

Finding these points is our goal. Then, we'll also find the middle point, called the vertex. With three points, we can graph the parabola.

Let's start by solving the equation $$5x^2 - 20x + 15 = 0$$. 

First, notice the coefficient in front of $$x^2$$ is 5. We can simplify by dividing everything by 5:
$$x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$$

Now, let's factor this. We need two numbers that multiply to 3 (the constant term) and add to -4 (the coefficient of $$x$$). These numbers are -3 and -1:
$$(x - 3)(x - 1) = 0$$

This means:
$$x - 3 = 0$$ or $$x - 1 = 0$$

So, $$x = 3$$ or $$x = 1$$.

We have two points where the parabola intersects the x-axis: (1, 0) and (3, 0).

Next, we find the vertex. The vertex lies exactly in the middle of these points. The x-coordinate of the vertex is:
$$\frac{1 + 3}{2} = 2$$.

To find the corresponding y-coordinate when $$x = 2$$, plug it into the original equation:
$$y = 5(2)^2 - 20(2) + 15$$
$$y = 5(4) - 20(2) + 15$$
$$y = 20 - 40 + 15$$
$$y = -5$$

So the vertex is at (2, -5).

We now have these points:
- (1, 0)
- (3, 0)
- (2, -5)

Let's plot these points:
- Plot (1, 0) and (3, 0) on the x-axis.
- Plot (2, -5) for the vertex.

Finally, when we plot and connect these points, we get our parabola!

Great job! We’ve successfully graphed the equation $$y = 5x^2 - 20x + 15$$. Keep practicing, and it'll get easier each time!
