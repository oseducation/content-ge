Alright, let me help you understand this interesting problem step-by-step.

On the left side of a scale, we have two different types of weights: one type weighs $$X$$ kg, and another type weighs $$Y$$ kg. We don't know their exact weights yet. There are two weights of $$X$$ kg and one weight of $$Y$$ kg on the left side.

Now, these weights balance perfectly with 8 kg of weights on the right side. So, we can write that as:

$$ 2X + Y = 8 $$

This means the total weight on the left side equals the total weight on the right side.

Next, letâ€™s ask ourselves if we can figure out the weights of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ with just this information. Unfortunately, we can't find exact values for $$X$$ and $$Y$$ just yet because we don't have enough information.

Luckily, we get more information. We take another weight of $$X$$ kg and another weight of $$Y$$ kg, and we balance this new combination with 5 kg on the other side. So, we have:

$$ X + Y = 5 $$

Now, the question is, how can we use these two pieces of information to find the exact weights of $$X$$ and $$Y$$?

We know from the second scale:

$$ X + Y = 5 $$

From the first scale, we had:

$$ 2X + Y = 8 $$

Let's subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $$Y$$:

$$ (2X + Y) - (X + Y) = 8 - 5 $$

This simplifies to:

$$ 2X - X + Y - Y = 3 $$

Or,

$$ X = 3 $$

So, we know that $$X$$ is 3 kg.

Now, let's find out what $$Y$$ is. We use the second equation:

$$ X + Y = 5 $$

Since we now know $$X$$ is 3:

$$ 3 + Y = 5 $$

To find $$Y$$, subtract 3 from both sides:

$$ Y = 5 - 3 $$

So, $$Y = 2$$.

Therefore, the weight of $$X$$ is 3 kg, and the weight of $$Y$$ is 2 kg.

To double-check, let's put these values back into the first equation:

$$ 2X + Y = 8 $$

$$ 2(3) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 $$

Which is correct! So the values $$X = 3$$ and $$Y = 2$$ balance the scale perfectly.

Well done! Now you've learned how to use algebra to solve for unknown weights using balance scales.
