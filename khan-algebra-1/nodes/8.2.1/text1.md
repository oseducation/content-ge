Sure, let's break that down together in simpler words:

The function $$f$$ is given by: 

$$f(t) = -2t + 5$$

This means whenever we put a number into the function, we first multiply it by $$-2$$ and then add $$5$$. Now, we need to find the number $$t$$ for which $$f(t) = 13$$.

So, if $$f(t) = 13$$, we have:

$$-2t + 5 = 13$$

Let's solve this step by step. 

1. Subtract $$5$$ from both sides to get rid of the $$5$$ on the left side:
	
	$$-2t + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5$$ 

	This simplifies to:

	$$-2t = 8$$ 

2. Now, we need to isolate $$t$$. To do this, we divide both sides by $$-2$$:

	$$t = \frac{8}{-2}$$ 

	This simplifies to:

	$$t = -4$$ 

So, when we put $$-4$$ into the function, it will give us $$13$$. In other words, $$f(-4) = 13$$. So, the number we input to get $$f(t) = 13$$ is $$-4$$.
