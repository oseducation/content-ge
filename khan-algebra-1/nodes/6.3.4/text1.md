Hey there! I'm really glad you're here to help with our party planning, but not everyone is happy. Meet Arbegla, the king's top adviser and main party planner. He's feeling a bit threatened by your amazing problem-solving skills, especially because he often messes up the cupcake orders by getting too many or too few.

So, Arbegla challenges you to solve a tricky potato chip problem that he couldn't figure out. The king agrees and asks you: How can we figure out the average number of potato chips needed? To do this, we need to know how many chips men and women each eat on average.

You bring up a good point: "What about the children?" But the king says, "In our kingdom, children aren't allowed to have potato chips."

"Alright," you say. "Let's look at what happened at past parties." The king tells you that at the last two parties, there were 500 adults in total. At the first party, 200 were men and 300 were women, and they ate 1,200 bags of potato chips. At the second party, there were 100 men and 400 women, and they ate 1,100 bags of chips.

"Okay," you say, "Let's define some variables to make this problem easier. We'll use $$m$$ for the number of bags eaten by each man and $$w$$ for the number of bags eaten by each woman."

For the first party:
- 200 men ate $$200m$$ bags in total.
- 300 women ate $$300w$$ bags in total.
- Together, they ate $$200m + 300w = 1200$$ bags.

For the second party:
- 100 men ate $$100m$$ bags in total.
- 400 women ate $$400w$$ bags in total.
- Together, they ate $$100m + 400w = 1100$$ bags.

Now, we have two equations:
1. $$200m + 300w = 1200$$
2. $$100m + 400w = 1100$$

We can solve these equations as a system of two equations with two unknowns. To make it easier, we can multiply the second equation by -2 so that the $$m$$ terms will cancel out when we add the equations.

So, let's multiply the second equation by -2:
$$-2(100m + 400w) = -2(1100)$$

This gives us:
$$-200m - 800w = -2200$$

Now, we'll add it to the first equation:
$$200m + 300w = 1200$$
$$+(-200m - 800w = -2200)$$

When we add these equations, the $$m$$ terms cancel out:
$$0m - 500w = -1000$$

This simplifies to:
$$-500w = -1000$$

Dividing both sides by -500, we find:
$$w = 2$$

So, women eat, on average, 2 bags of potato chips. Now, we need to find out how many bags men eat on average.

We can use either of the original equations to solve for $$m$$. Let's use the first equation:
$$200m + 300(2) = 1200$$

This gives us:
$$200m + 600 = 1200$$

Subtract 600 from both sides:
$$200m = 600$$

Then, divide by 200:
$$m = 3$$

So, men eat, on average, 3 bags of potato chips. You've solved Arbegla's difficult problem with some good old-fashioned algebra! Now the king knows that, on average, men will eat 3 bags and women will eat 2 bags of potato chips at the parties. Great job!
