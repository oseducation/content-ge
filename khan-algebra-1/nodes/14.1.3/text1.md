Sure, let's break it down together!

Hey there! So, Katie throws a ball in the air for her dog to chase. We have a function $$f$$ that shows how high the ball goes (in meters) over time (in seconds) after Katie throws it. 

- At time $$t = 0$$ (right when she throws it), the ball is already a few meters high.
- The ball keeps rising until a little under 2.5 seconds, then it starts to fall.
- By the time we get close to 5 seconds, the ball is on the ground again, meaning its height is zero meters.

Now, they ask us which statements about this situation are true. Let’s check each one:

1. **Katie threw the ball from a height of five meters.**
   - If this were true, at $$t = 0$$, the height would be 5 meters. But it looks like she threw it from around 1.5 or 2 meters. Katie is likely just standing on the ground, not on a ladder, so this statement is false.

2. **At its highest point, the ball was about 31 meters above the ground.**
   - Looking at the function, the highest point does indeed seem close to 31 meters. So, this statement is true. 

3. **The ball was in the air for about 2.5 seconds.**
   - We can see that the ball goes up for about 2.5 seconds and then comes down for another 2.5 seconds, making it almost 5 seconds in total. Therefore, this statement is false because the ball was actually in the air for nearly 5 seconds.

4. **The ball reached its highest point about 2.5 seconds after Katie threw it.**
   - The highest point is a little before 2.5 seconds, but since they say "about" 2.5 seconds (not exactly), this statement can be considered true. If they had said "exactly 2.5 seconds," it wouldn’t be correct.

So there you have it! The true statements are the second and the last ones. I hope that makes it clear! Let me know if you have any more questions!
