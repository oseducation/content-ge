**Algebra's Origins**

Today, we'll explore where algebra started. The word "algebra" and the ideas it represents come from an old book. Here's a page from that book. The English title of this book is the "Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing." It was written by a Persian mathematician living in Baghdad around 820 AD, in the eighth or ninth century.

**The Meaning of Algebra**

The word "algebra" itself is Arabic. The original title of the book has these words: "Al-kitab,” which means "book." "Al-mukhtasar" likely means "compendious." "Fihisab" means "calculation.” And then we have “Al-gabr,” the root of the word algebra, meaning "restoration" or "completion." Lastly, "wa'l-muqabala" means "balancing."

If we put this all together, the title means something like "The Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing." This is where the term algebra comes from, and this book is very important. It didn’t just use the word algebra first; it also introduced many ideas that form modern algebra, like balancing equations.

**Historical Context**

The author, al-Khwarizmi, lived in Baghdad, situated in what is now modern-day Iraq. This region frequently appears in the history of algebra. Al-Khwarizmi wrote his book around the eighth or ninth century.

**Timeline Overview**

To understand when this happened, let’s draw a timeline. Modern dates are often referenced to the birth of Jesus, so around the year 0. If we go back, we have 1000 BC (before Christ) and 2000 BC. Going forward, we have 1000 AD and 2000 AD.

**Early Algebra**

The first known people to work on algebra-like problems were from ancient Babylon, around 2000 BC. They used stone tablets and explored basic algebra ideas, even though they used different symbols. Babylon was part of Mesopotamia, meaning "land between rivers."

**Greek Contribution**

Fast forward to 200-300 AD, a Greek in Alexandria (now Egypt), named Diophantus, also worked on algebra. Some call him the "father of algebra.” He focused on particular problems, unlike al-Khwarizmi, who considered algebra in a broader sense.

**Other Contributions**

In India around 600 AD, Brahmagupta made significant contributions to algebra. Then came al-Khwarizmi in the eighth or ninth century, who is credited with the term "algebra" and for advancing algebraic thinking.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, algebra's history is rich, with contributions from Babylonian, Greek, and Indian mathematicians. Al-Khwarizmi played a key role in developing what we now understand as algebra.
