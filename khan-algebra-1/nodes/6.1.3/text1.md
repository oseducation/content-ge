Sure! Let's chat about this step by step to see if the point $(-1, 7)$ is a solution for the system of linear equations. We have these two equations:

1. $$x + 2y = 13$$
2. $$3x - y = -11$$

For $(-1, 7)$ to be a solution, it needs to work in both equations. In other words, $x = -1$ and $y = 7$ need to make each equation true.

**First Equation:**

Let's check the first equation: 
$$x + 2y = 13$$

Substitute $x = -1$ and $y = 7$:
$$-1 + 2 \cdot 7 = 13$$

We get: 
$$-1 + 14 = 13$$

And: 
$$13 = 13$$

This is true, so $(-1, 7)$ does satisfy the first equation.

**Second Equation:**

Now, let's check the second equation:
$$3x - y = -11$$

Substitute $x = -1$ and $y = 7$:
$$3 \cdot (-1) - 7 = -11$$

We get:
$$-3 - 7 = -10$$

But: 
$$-10 \neq -11$$

This is not true, so $(-1, 7)$ does not satisfy the second equation.

Therefore, $(-1, 7)$ is not a solution for the system because it only works for the first equation and not the second one. For it to be a solution to the system of equations, it must work in both equations. So the answer is no.
