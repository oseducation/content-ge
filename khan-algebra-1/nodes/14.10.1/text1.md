Hey there! So you have a second-degree equation, often called a quadratic equation, and you know its graph will look like a parabola. This means it can either open upwards or downwards. Since the coefficient in front of the $$x^2$$ term is positive, your parabola will open upwards.

You're curious about the vertex of this parabola. For an upward-opening parabola, the vertex is the lowest point. If it opened downwards, the vertex would be the highest point. You want to find the x-coordinate where this function takes on its minimum value. 

There are a few ways to find this vertex, but one of the easiest ways is using a formula. The x-coordinate of the vertex for a quadratic equation can be found using $$-\frac{b}{2a}$$. In this formula, $$b$$ is the coefficient of the $$x$$ term and $$a$$ is the coefficient of the $$x^2$$ term.

For your equation, if $$b$$ is $$-20$$ and $$a$$ is $$5$$, you can plug these values into the formula:

$$-\frac{-20}{2 \times 5} = \frac{20}{10} = 2$$

So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $$2$$. Now, to find the y-coordinate of the vertex, you substitute $$x = 2$$ back into the original equation and solve for y:

$$ y = 5(2)^2 - 20(2) + 15 = 5 \cdot 4 - 40 + 15 = 20 - 40 + 15 = -5 $$

So, the vertex of your parabola is at the point $$(2, -5)$$.

If you prefer understanding the reasoning instead of just using a formula, let's look at another method called "completing the square." This method helps you rewrite the equation in a way that easily identifies the vertex.

Your equation might look something like this to start:

$$ y = 5x^2 - 20x + 15 $$

First, take out the common factor from the first two terms—here it’s $$5$$:

$$ y = 5(x^2 - 4x) + 15 $$

To complete the square inside the parentheses, take half of the coefficient of $$x$$ (which is $$-4$$), square it, and add that inside the parentheses. Remember to keep the equation balanced by subtracting it back out:

$$ y = 5(x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4) + 15 $$

This becomes:

$$ y = 5((x - 2)^2 - 4) + 15 $$

Now, distribute the factor of $$5$$:

$$ y = 5(x - 2)^2 - 20 + 15 $$

Simplify this to get:

$$ y = 5(x - 2)^2 - 5 $$

Looking at this equation, the minimum value occurs when the squared term $$(x - 2)^2$$ is at its smallest, which is $$0$$. This happens when $$x = 2$$. Plugging in $$x = 2$$, you get:

$$ y = -5 $$

So the vertex is indeed $$(2, -5)$$. This method, completing the square, shows you exactly why the vertex is what it is. Hope this helps!
