Sure! Let's walk through finding the slope step-by-step, using simple words so it's easy to understand.

First, we need to find the slope of the line that passes through the points $$(7, -1)$$ and $$(-3, -1)$$. 

## Visualize the Points
Let's draw a quick graph to help us see the points. 

1. Draw the x-axis (horizontal line) and y-axis (vertical line).
2. Plot the first point at $$(7, -1)$$. Start at the origin (0,0), move right to 7 on the x-axis, and then down to -1 on the y-axis.
3. Next, plot the second point at $$(-3, -1)$$. Start at the origin, move left to -3 on the x-axis, and then down to -1 on the y-axis.

You'll notice both points are on the same horizontal line because their y-coordinate is the same (-1).

## Understanding Slope
The slope is a measure of how steep a line is. It's defined as the "rise over run", or the change in y divided by the change in x. You may see it written as $$m$$.

Here's the formula for slope:
$$
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$
where:
- $$\Delta y$$ is the change in y (y2 - y1)
- $$\Delta x$$ is the change in x (x2 - x1)

## Calculate the Slope
Let's use the points $$(7, -1)$$ and $$(-3, -1)$$.

1. First, find the change in y:
$$
\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = -1 - (-1) = -1 + 1 = 0
$$

2. Next, find the change in x:
$$
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = -3 - 7 = -10
$$

Now put these values into the slope formula:
$$
m = \frac{0}{-10} = 0
$$

## Conclusion
Since the change in y is 0, no matter how much you change x, the slope is 0. This means the line is completely flat and horizontal. The slope is 0 because there is no rise, only a run. 

I hope this helps you understand how to find the slope and why it's 0 in this case! Feel free to ask if you have any questions!
