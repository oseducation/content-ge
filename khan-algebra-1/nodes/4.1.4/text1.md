Hey there! Let's work on a problem about graphing solutions to two-variable linear equations. Imagine we're doing an exercise from Khan Academy. They want us to fill in a table where each row is a solution to an equation they give us. Here's what we need to do:

1. Figure out what $$ y $$ equals when $$ x = -5 $$.
2. Figure out what $$ x $$ equals when $$ y = 8 $$.

First, let's handle $$ y $$ when $$ x = -5 $$.

Given equation:
$$ -3x + 7y = 5x + 2y $$

Let's substitute $$ x $$ with $$ -5 $$:
$$ -3(-5) + 7y = 5(-5) + 2y $$

Simplifying:
$$ 15 + 7y = -25 + 2y $$

Next, move $$ y $$ terms to one side:
Subtract $$ 2y $$ from both sides:
$$ 15 + 7y - 2y = -25 $$

We get:
$$ 5y = -40 $$

Now, divide by 5:
$$ y = -8 $$

So, when $$ x = -5 $$, $$ y = -8 $$.

Now, let's find $$ x $$ when $$ y = 8 $$.

Substitute $$ y $$ with $$ 8 $$:
$$ -3x + 7(8) = 5x + 2(8) $$

Simplifying:
$$ -3x + 56 = 5x + 16 $$

Move $$ x $$ terms to one side:
Add $$ 3x $$ to both sides and subtract 16 from both sides:
$$ 56 - 16 = 5x + 3x $$

We get:
$$ 40 = 8x $$

Now, divide by 8:
$$ x = 5 $$

So, when $$ y = 8 $$, $$ x = 5 $$.

Next, we can graph these two points: $(-5, -8)$ and $(5, 8)$. Here's how you do it:

- For $(-5, -8)$, go left 5 units and down 8 units on the graph.
- For $(5, 8)$, go right 5 units and up 8 units on the graph.

Connect the points, and you've graphed the equation!

You could also simplify the equation first to make things easier:
Given equation:
$$ -3x + 7y = 5x + 2y $$

Get all $$ x $$ terms on one side and $$ y $$ terms on the other:
$$ -3x + 3x + 7y - 2y = 5x + 3x + 2y - 2y $$

Simplify:
$$ 5y = 8x $$

Divide by 5:
$$ y = \frac{8}{5} x $$

Now, you can use this simpler equation to find the same solutions!

- When $$ x = -5 $$, $$ y = \frac{8}{5}(-5) = -8 $$
- When $$ y = 8 $$, you can see that $$ 8 = \frac{8}{5} x $$ so $$ x = 5 $$.

There you go! You can solve it either way, but simplifying the equation first often makes it easier.

Great job working through this with me! Keep practicing, and these will become second nature to you!
