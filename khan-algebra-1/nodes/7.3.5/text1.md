Sure! Let's break this down together, step by step.

So, we're told that a cupcake needs 35 grams of sugar and 50 grams of flour. I'll underline those important points. A muffin needs 30 grams of sugar and 65 grams of flour. Let's underline that too.

Now, here's what they want us to do: Shawna needs to use at least 460 grams of sugar. We'll use a different color to underline this. She also wants to use at most 970 grams of flour. Let’s underline this as well.

We need to create a system of inequalities to show Shawna’s conditions. We'll use $$C$$ to represent the number of cupcakes and $$M$$ for the number of muffins.

First, let's write an inequality for the sugar. Shawna needs to use at least 460 grams of sugar. 

For cupcakes, each one needs 35 grams. So, the total sugar for the cupcakes is $$35C$$. For muffins, each one needs 30 grams. So, the total sugar for the muffins is $$30M$$. If we add these together, the total sugar used is $$35C + 30M$$. Since Shawna needs at least 460 grams, we write the inequality as:
$$35C + 30M \geq 460$$

Next, let's write an inequality for the flour. Shawna wants to use at most 970 grams of flour.

For cupcakes, each one needs 50 grams. So, the total flour for the cupcakes is $$50C$$. For muffins, each one needs 65 grams. So, the total flour for the muffins is $$65M$$. If we add these together, the total flour used is $$50C + 65M$$. Since Shawna wants to use at most 970 grams of flour, we write the inequality as:
$$50C + 65M \leq 970$$

Now we have the system of inequalities:
$$35C + 30M \geq 460$$
$$50C + 65M \leq 970$$

You can use these inequalities to find the pairs of $$C$$ and $$M$$ (the number of cupcakes and muffins) that meet Shawna’s conditions. This helps us see how many cupcakes and muffins Shawna can make.

I hope this makes sense! If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
