Sure! Let's go through this step by step and rephrase it in a simple and friendly way.

Hey there! We're looking at two functions to see which one has a bigger y-intercept.

Remember, the y-intercept is where the function touches the y-axis, which happens when $$x$$ is zero.

For the function $$f(x)$$, when $$x = 0$$, we have:

$$ f(0) = 0 - 0 + 4 = 4 $$

So, $$f(x)$$ has a y-intercept of 4. This means it crosses the y-axis at 4.

Now, let's compare this with the function $$g(x)$$. Looking at its graph, the y-intercept is 3.

So, which function has the greater y-intercept? It's $$f(x)$$ because 4 is greater than 3.

Let's try another one. How many roots do the functions have in common?

For function $$g(x)$$, we can see its roots on the graph. The roots are the values where the function touches the x-axis, which are $$x = -1$$ and $$x = 2$$. 

Next, letâ€™s find the roots for $$f(x)$$. We can factor it to make it simpler. 

We need two numbers that add up to 1 (the middle number in the equation) and multiply to -6 (the last number).  

Those numbers are 3 and -2, so we can write:

$$ f(x) = (x + 3)(x - 2) $$

This means the roots are $$x = -3$$ and $$x = 2$$.

So, $$f(x)$$ has roots at $$x = -3$$ and $$x = 2$$.

The common root between $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$ is $$x = 2$$. 

That's only one common root.

Now, another question asks if the functions have the same "concavity." 

Concavity describes whether a graph opens upwards (like a cup) or downwards (like a cap). 

If the coefficient of $$x^2$$ (the number in front of $$x^2$$) is positive, the graph opens upwards. If it's negative, the graph opens downwards.

For $$g(x)$$, the graph opens downwards.

For $$f(x)$$, because the coefficient of $$x^2$$ is positive, the graph opens upwards. 

So, do they have the same concavity? Nope, they don't. 

If $$f(x)$$ had a negative $$x^2$$ term (like $$-4x^2$$), it would be concave downwards like $$g(x)$$.

I hope this was helpful and interesting for you! Keep practicing and asking questions. ðŸ˜Š
