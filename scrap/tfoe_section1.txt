22
business schools do a pretty good job of
24
providing students with theoretical
27
frameworks which can sometimes be
29
applied to real world problems
32
however
34
quite often they overlook the most
36
crucial and practical business lessons
38
like how to network how to find
40
customers or how to get a job
43
if you want to learn how to get a
44
meeting with almost anyone or take your
47
career to the next level then this
49
course is for you
51
i've worked at goldman sachs
53
i've met with top business people
55
including bill gates warren buffett and
57
the founders of the biggest technology
59
companies and at the end of all my
61
meetings with these visionaries
63
i've always asked them for advice on
65
what made them so successful
67
and a lot of what they taught me is not
69
taught in business school so i put
71
together a list of every lesson and i've
74
included it in this book and in this
77
course
80
[Music]
84
these lessons will help you take your
85
career to the next level
87
it's exciting to reinvent yourself in
89
ways that you never thought were
90
possible
92
until you realize it is possible
96
anything is possible as many of my
99
students that have taken this course
100
i've realized
103
[Music]
109
[Music]
112

113
passion into this course
115
and i'm humbled to say
117
that business insider wrote an article
119
stating that my book 101 crucial lessons
122
they don't teach you in business school
124
was voted as the number one business
126
book of the year
127
also forbes magazine stated
130
that this book is one of six books that
133
every entrepreneur needs to read right
134
now
137
so let me teach you about these crucial
139
business lessons

[Music]
154
in november of
155
2015 uh one of my clients when i worked
159
full-time in venture capital had an
160
extra ticket to go to the tony robbins
163
uh event
164
called upw meaning unleash the power
167
within uh down in los angeles uh and so
169
i i i graciously accepted and i went
172
down
173
and in la i think it was at the staples
175
center or a very large convention center
177
there's ten thousand people in the
178
audience it was crazy it was awesome
180
and it was a four-day event
182
and we went through a lot of exercises
185
goal setting workshops etc
188
and then
189
including walking across hot fire coals
192
on the saturday night
194
and tony conditioned us tony robbins
197
and i actually ended up meeting him
198
another time for business really reasons
200
really nice guy but and when i shook his
202
hand his hand like wrapped around my
203
hand he's a big dude big dude but a
206
really nice guy as well
208
but what he did was on the saturday
210
night of that four-day event back in
213
2015
215
he
216
had us walk across boiling hot coals
219
like it looked like lava
221
and he conditioned us to
223
believe
224
in our mind that we're not going to feel
226
any pain at all
229
he conditioned us to do that and so i
230
walked across the coals
232
and i didn't feel any pain at all it was
234
exhilarating and of course i had lots of
235
fire hoses there just in case whatever i
238
didn't feel any pain it was amazing
240
uh and and i went back to my hotel it
243
was actually an airbnb that night uh in
244
in la
246
and i um i i couldn't sleep because i
249
was excited but also because there's
250
blisters in my feet and i had to take a
252
bunch of advil
253
my feet were fine though
255
but that that event kind of changed me
257
it really changed me and on the sunday
260
of that four day event uh what tony
262
robbins did was he said that
265
write down your goals
266
and he then said
268
i want you to think of one particular
270
goal
271
that you've been kind of putting off for
272
a while in your life
274
and what i want you to do is i want you
276
to write down that goal
277
and i also want you to write down a
279
deadline date
281
okay most most people don't set deadline
282
dates for goals
284
and so what i did was i was writing this
285
book for a couple of years you know uh
288
and it's this book back here of course
290
101 crucial lessons i don't teach in
292
business school
293
and
294
i
295
every time i met with somebody very very
296
successful i'd ask for advice and i
299
documented
300
and then what happened was um i wrote
302
down a deadline date that sunday before
304
i flew back home the fourth day of the
306
conference
307
and i wrote i'll finish this book in two
309
or three weeks
311
and i flew home
312
and it was a sunday night
314
then on a monday morning i went into
316
work
318
and there's three general partners of
320
ours in the firm myself included
322
and i i just wasn't into it my heart
326
wasn't into work that day
328
and so around noon that day on that
330
monday i said i'm i'm gonna
332
i'm gonna i'm gonna go home guys i'll
333
i'll see ya i'm just not feeling it and
335
they were cool they're like all right
336
chris we'll see you tomorrow or whenever
338
right so
340
um and and i could do that because there
342
was there's three of us owned the fund
344
so i went home
346
and i started writing a little bit on
348
that monday
350
and then i couldn't stop it was like
352
that jerry maguire movie um and when tom
355

384
up not really going back to work i kind
386
of did for a while but i wasn't into it
389
but
390
it that that changed me that event and
392
that led me to want to just
394
live my life my own terms and embrace my
397
passion which is teaching and up to that
399
point i had been teaching during the
401
evenings at a couple san francisco bay
403
area business schools mba and undergrad
406

415

417

421

463
when to go to the book uh and and when

to do the exercises let me just
467
rearrange my screen here and touch uh
469
there's a quote here um from this kind
472
of ugly guy who has awful doubt humor
475
um but he's a bit humble sometimes the
478
quote is the best entrepreneurs don't
480
think that the glass is half empty or
482
half full they believe that the glass is
485
overflowing
487
and i really do believe that you know i
489
always see the positives in life always
491
always always you know what we think we
493
perceive you know thoughts your thoughts
495
become reality
497
um so um yeah we're 28 through other way
500
through uh this this course right now uh
502
and so as i mentioned before um we're
504
going to go through this book this book
506
uh in a lot a lot of detail a lot of
508
detail and uh i published this um not
512
only on um on on kindle but also amazon
515
the print version uh and many of my
517
students uh i'm so happy to hear
519
uh have started to publish your own
520
books as well and i've got copies in
523
here
524
uh and i also published it on on on
527
audible.com i went to acx.com and did it
530
there and that's the cover of the book
532
from audible and i have the cover of the
534
book made by some dude um i can't
536
remember where he is actually no it was
538
a woman actually actually her name is
540
ultra contu
541
on fiverr.com and she's based in
543
bangladesh and she's great so she made
545
this cover yeah
546
yeah um and then uh what happened was
549
i'm humbled to say that uh per this this
551
video here um
553
it was
554
forbes wrote an article saying this is
556
one of six books every entrepreneur
558
should read right now along with lean
559
startup zero to one by peter thiel uh
562
the self-made um billionaire effect
565
start with why by simon sinek and the
567
seven habits of highly effective people
569
by stephen covey i actually went to
570
business school at columbia with stephen
572
covey covey's kit yeah
574
so this this kind of changed my life uh
576
this this book uh and i i was very
579
transparent in this book
581
and i find that it's easier for me uh to
584
read social media posts or books or
586
articles if they're very very short when
588
i was a kid i loved reading books by
591
roald dahl
593
he made james and the giant peach
595
and charlie in the chocolate factory and
597
that influenced me because roald dahl
599
that his chapters were very very short
601
it was just easy for me to to go through
603
it and that's what i did with this book
605
here as well i kept the chapters very
607
very short uh and i'm humbled to say
610
that it was also the number three
612
bestseller i think the kindle version
613
for a while on on on amazon it's still
615
it's since trailed off a bunch troll off
618
a bunch yeah
619
but i had a lot of fun put this together
620
so there's 17 sections in the book
624
and we're going to talk about the book
625
in two different parts and so as i
627
mentioned before
628
the first half of the book is today's
630
is in today's workbook we're gonna do
632
sections one through eight uh and then
635
next class um we're gonna do the second
638
half of the book and discuss sections
641
nine through seventeen okay so let me
644
show you what that means so if you go
646
here to to the workbook
648
um you'll see here that this is more
650
than 50 pages and it might be the page
653
link might be a little bit different
654
depending on how many notes you take
656
in this workbook
657
as well as if you're using it on a
659
different form factor or pdf version
662
or the the word version microsoft word
664
version but the contents are the same
666
and so what i'll do is i will ask you to
668
click on these numbers
670
every now and then to start doing
672
exercises and i'll make it very very
673
intuitive to know exactly how to do this
675
and when as well
677
and so
678
you click here
679
and then you click down here now
681
if you can't see a hyperlink here after
684
you click this then go up here and just
685
click section one two three etc and what
688
i did also
690
was
691
i put here the table of contents for the
693
first half of the book
695
and if you're using the microsoft word
697
version of this document or the google
699
docs version you can click on any of
701
these to jump right to these chapters in
703
in the book
704
um it doesn't work i don't think on the
707
pdf version so just scroll to where you
709
should be
710
so i included actually all of um
713
all the content of the book the first
715
half at least today and i'll include the
716
next half of the book in next class's
718
workbook so if you go here to section
721
one
722
i i talk about here high level what we
724
cover in section one
726
i had a lot of fun with 3d images today
728
too
729
and then if you want you can type your
731
notes here
732
for lesson number one
734
and below each
736
lesson title
738
is the actual text from the book and
740
don't read this
741
during class read it during during
742
homework or on the side if you want to
744
it's optional completely
746
so you can take notes here on on lesson
749
number one if you want to and what
750
you've learned
753
and what you can also do is if you go to
755
the next lesson here number two you can
758
take notes here again and again there's
760
a text here from that chapter they're
762
very short
763
and you have to read the entire thing
765
you can skim it or read another day
768
all right so let me go back here to the
769
top just we're on the same page does
772
that work oh yeah good
773
there we go good
775
all right so um as i talk about all 101
779
lessons in today's class and next class
781
as well um you can take down notes as i
783
just showed you
785
in in the uh
787
in the workbook you downloaded today
789
so let's start now with with topic
791
number one
793
so uh
794
section number one uh is called
797
relationships are more important than
799
product knowledge um and uh i have a
802
little catch phrase for all all the
804
sections in the book so the first cache
806
phrase for section one is crucial
807
networking tips to make you more
809
successful now
810
we've covered a bunch of this before so
812
i'm just going to go over what we've
814
already covered very quickly so i can
816
focus much more attention on the new
817
stuff but it's always important to
820
re-emphasize what i've taught you before
822
because
823
repetition is the mother of all skill
826
okay so the very first lesson is steve
829
jobs winning strategy uh how to get
832
anything you want
834
um and and if you're watching the replay
835
i mean the non-live version of this
837
lecture uh what you can do if you want
839
uh is
840
you can actually go to um
842
go to chapter one here or i should say
844
uh the uh lesson number one by going
847
here
848
and what you can do is just click on
850
this video here to watch a
852
short video of steve jobs uh and if you
854
don't want to click on this you can just
855
search for three words uh in uh in
858
youtube which are steve jobs ask
860
um and
862
you will never get anything you want in
864
life now if you don't ask
867
and when we were younger
869
growing up um we were kids
872
we asked our parents all the time for
875
stuff you know like my youngest one
877
drives me crazy i love them though he
879
says dad can i have some candy i'll say
881
no
882
literally a minute later he'll say can i
883
ask him kenny now
885
no and then he'll ask again like five
887
he's relentless relentless
890
uh and then what happens is you stop
892
asking once you've been conditioned to
894
stop doing that for whatever reason um
898
and and you can be tactful when you ask
900
and not overdo it and upset people
902
obviously but what happens is once we're
904
done with high school
906
for a lot of us when we go to a
907
university or or start our first job
909
whatever it is
911
we don't really ask for anything because
913
we learn that if we keep our heads down
915
and we get good grades
917
then everyone's proud of us and life
919
works better
920
but then what happens is many years into
922
your career
924
you wake up one day and you look around
926
and you think to yourself my goodness
929
why are all these other people around me
932
getting uh getting promoted
934
and not me
935
why are all these other less capable
937
people
938
around me getting raises and not me
942
and you realize and it might be too late
944
or it's never too late but sometimes it
947
it takes you to your 40s till you
948
realize this
950
that if you want a raise or promotion
952
you have to ask
953
nobody's ever made ceo or ever raised a
956
lot of money as an entrepreneur without
959
asking over and over and over and over
961
again
962
and do you ever see somebody that is is
964
kind of average looking
967
and uh their significant other is
970
unbelievably attractive
972
and
973
you wonder what's going on
976
why how did that happen and it's not
978
always about money okay
979
um it's it's because the the person
982
that's less attractive and and we we
983
refer to this usually as the matching
985
principle in psychology
987
you know people that are they're both
988
very good looking usually end up dating
991
but there's always
993
an exception and many exceptions and
995
it's not just about money
998
it's about the person who
1001
is
1002
maybe average looking or whatever
1004
just thinking themselves
1006
i've got nothing to lose and everything
1007
to gain i'm going to keep asking people
1009
out over and over and over again because
1011
i know
1012
that the pain from being rejected a
1014
bunch of times is nothing
1016
compared to the pleasure which is
1018
massive
1019
of being of this person saying yes to a
1022
date so to speak you got to be
1024
relentless and a lot of entrepreneurs
1027
are like that as well
1028
they're they're relentless they they
1030
they just don't stop they're aggressive
1033
they're aggressive and and they just
1034
don't they really don't care what people
1036
think of them either and that's why
1037
they're very very successful they don't
1039
give a damn what people think yeah
1043
so
1044
you got to be the same way as well sorry
1046
my stomach's grambling trembling here i
1048
got this new ninja bullet thing and i'm
1050
it's my new diet here
1055
kale blueberries etc gives me energy
1058
so you got to ask
1060
if you want anything in life you got to
1062
ask over and over and over and over and
1064
over and over again
1066
kind of like michael jordan i feel over
1068
and over and over again and that's why i
1070
succeed
1071
don't forget that please don't forget
1073
that you got to ask
1075
ask often be a pain in the neck and
1078
don't give a damn if you get rejected
1080
who gives a damn
1081
you know jk rowling she you know she she
1084
got rejected by like 29 or 30 publishers
1087
she didn't give a damn that people
1088
thought she was a failure who cares
1090
on the 30th they said yes and she's a
1092
billionaire now
1095
all right let's move on now to number
1097
two um how to get a job and why sending
1100
in a resume can be a waste of time there
1103
is a better way
1105
but even if you have an amazing resume
1106
and an amazing linkedin profile it's not
1108
enough
1109
you're gonna have to network like crazy
1111
you're gonna have to do a ton of
1113
informational meetings that's how you
1115
get jobs in this new digital reality
1117
that's just how it works
1119
because if you apply online you're one
1121
of a thousand people applying for a job
1123
and the dude that gets the job is
1124
usually the one that knows somebody at
1127
the company
1128
so and we've covered this a lot before
1129
so i'm gonna skip over this one here uh
1131
but your your your network is your net
1133
your your net worth yeah
1137
all right next up is uh business is
1139
about people and not about what you know
1142
um you know a big rookie mistake is
1145
going to any business meeting and just
1146
talking about business right away that
1148
doesn't matter dude
1150
it doesn't matter most jobs in the world
1152
are sales
1154
and
1155
most ceo roles
1157
you're a salesperson and if you're a
1159
partner in a law firm
1160
don't be a part of a law firm but if
1162
you're a partner in a law firm uh or or
1164
in a venture capital firm you're a sales
1166
person as well
1168
so how do they do it well they do it by
1170
bonding and we've talked a lot about
1172
this before bond before business
1174
so business is about people
1176
and and not what you know it's important
1178
to reinforce that
1180
now
1180
what you have to do also is uh in in i
1183
knew a guy
1184
who is the head of government sales at
1187
ibm in dc
1189
and i had um i had dinner with him one
1192
night with him and with uh mohit aaron
1195
uh who's the founder of a great company
1196
called cohisti when i was on mohit's
1198
board
1199
and uh it was a great it was a great
1201
dinner we we had dinner in palo alto and
1204
because this dude
1205
was at ibm and in a very senior role
1207
i asked him you know i said how did you
1209
get to where you got
1211
and he talked about how he learned a lot
1213
from working actually in politics and i
1216
said oh what do you mean by that he said
1218
well in in the early 90s i worked for
1221
george bush senior in the white house
1224
and uh i was like oh my gosh this is
1227
amazing i got to ask you questions
1229
um and so i asked him i said can you
1231
please give me
1233
the most important lesson you learned
1235
from work in the white house for bush
1236
senior why was he successful
1240
and this guy told me he said it's
1242
because uh
1243
bush senior would treat people like
1245
celebrities and celebrities like people
1249
so
1250
if if you ever meet a celebrity or
1252
somebody very senior in your company
1254
just treat like a dream like a normal
1255
person they'll feel uncomfortable if you
1257
treat me differently
1259
and if you meet somebody who's not so
1261
important whatever on how you classify
1263
what not so important means
1264
treat them like a celebrity as well you
1266
know ask a lot of questions ask them a
1268
lot of questions you know where'd you
1270
grow up and that sort of thing and just
1273
just learn from them just bond
1275
and don't forget to say people's names
1277
at least once or twice during during a
1279
longer conversation it's more personable
1281
that way
1282
and after you meet with anybody
1284
um connect with them immediately on
1286
linkedin as well and just remember their
1288
name and while you're going off script
1289
here but while you're talking to them
1291
what you got to do is
1293
you got to visualize and think about
1296
how you're going to remember their name
1298
and so
1299
uh when i was 19 i actually did the dale
1302
carnegie public speaking program
1306
and
1307
there's this woman named uh cynthia
1310
mustachio
1311
and i met her once there back when i was
1314
19 like
1315
ages ago last century
1318
and her name was cynthia mustachio but i
1320
remember thinking to myself every time i
1322
see her i'm going to think she has a big
1324
mustache
1325
and so that's how i remember cynthia
1327
mustachio
1328
and you got to do the same thing as well
1329
what you can do is you when you when you
1331
meet people because it's really
1332
embarrassing man like if you go to a a
1334
party or something
1336
and you forget somebody's name
1338
it's embarrassing to just say hey you
1341
which is what i do sometimes to be
1342
intellectually honest
1344
but what i what i do it's awful for me
1346
it's the worst for me because my wife's
1348
name is the same name as me her name is
1349
christine i'm chris
1351
so everybody remembers chris and
1352
christine
1354
and so we go to parties and and i i do
1356
this actually this i probably shouldn't
1358
tell you this trick i'm going there
1359
anywhere i don't care fully transparent
1361
as always
1362
so if christine is beside me at a party
1365
and there's somebody beside me and i
1366
have no idea what their name is i forget
1369
i go like this i scratch my neck and
1371
then christine jumps in and introduces
1373
herself
1374
and at the end of the night i've lost
1376
like eight layers of skin just kidding
1378
on my neck yeah but it works but you got
1380
to remember people's names and do name
1382
association as well
1384
if you can and so when you meet somebody
1386
if their first name uh is uh similar to
1390
a rock star's name or the same as a rock
1392
star's name uh then just think of it
1395
that way like if you meet somebody named
1397
bob
1398
um just just think of bob dylan you know
1400
singing a song or in an interview saying
1402
hey
1403
you know you can't really understand it
1405
but it's it's silly visualization i get
1407
it but you'll never forget it yeah yeah
1411
all right
1412
all right uh next and and also um
1417
not not just rock stars but think of i
1419
think of actors as well when you meet
1421
somebody or something really really
1423
silly really silly like like cynthia
1425
mustachio
1427
okay moving on
1429
all right next up um i want you to meet
1431
people have fun and learn and there's no
1433
reason why i threw in baby yoda here
1435
other than the fact that i think that
1436
baby yoda is adorable
1438
um
1440
no but in all seriousness um
1443
when i went down to wall street to work
1444
at goldman i was so nervous man i i was
1448
nervous because i i thought and i
1450
remember that time really well i had
1452
nirvana's song in my head dumb
1455
nirvana had it
1456
one of the early albums it was great
1458
there's a song called dumb
1460
and it goes i think i'm dumb i think i'm
1462
dumb and i remember when i was at
1463
goldman i remember thinking to myself
1466
if i don't say anything ever to anybody
1469
they might think i'm dumb
1471
but if i actually open my mouth and
1473
start talking they'll know i'm dumb
1475
and then the kirk cobain track would go
1477
on and on and on in my head
1479
perception becomes reality you got to
1481
get that out of your mind and so i told
1483
myself three things which assuaged my
1485
concerns you know when i went down and
1488
in hindsight i would have told myself
1489
fourth and the fourth thing would have
1490
been god already knows what's gonna
1492
happen so just don't worry just enjoy it
1495
don't question your faith
1497
but the three things i told myself at
1498
the time when i went down to goldman um
1501
was and i and i loved the power of three
1502
as you know uh in all my presentations
1504
and in everything
1506
um
1507
you know
1507
what i would say was uh i all i want to
1510
do is i want to meet people
1511
have fun and learn that's it
1515
those are my goals
1517
that's it
1518
and it was great
1519
because i met a ton of people my network
1521
is amazing partially because of that
1523
i enjoyed it i had fun i never saw it as
1526
works i conditioned myself to enjoy it i
1528
learned a ton and once you stop learning
1530
you got to move on to another job
1533
so if you're you're ever nervous about a
1536
new job
1537
don't worry because when you start a
1538
brand new job i don't care how old or
1540
young you are they're not going to give
1542
you like mission critical stuff right
1543
away
1544
especially when you're younger you know
1546
you're not going to show up first day
1548
and they're going to say write me a
1549
proposal on on if ibm should buy red hat
1551
which they already did but you know what
1553
i mean
1554
um don't worry when you show up you go
1556
through a training program or you'll
1557
you'll get mentors whatever or you'll
1559
photocopy like i did uh which i did with
1562
pleasure because i read all the stuff
1563
when i was photocopying when i worked at
1565
accenture i learned
1567
meet people have fun and learn
1571
all right next up we've got the
1573
importance of sincere gratitude
1576
and so this is a a great book here by
1578
the dalai lama called the art of
1580
happiness which i i read on my honeymoon
1582
actually um and i read this actually we
1584
were in um we were in bali and i bought
1586
the book and i read it there such a
1587
beautiful place to read that book too i
1589
loved it and the indonesian people were
1591
so nice oh my god they're incredible
1593
but read this book if you get a chance
1597
because it will really help you
1598
understand the importance of of of
1601
gratitude you know be grateful for
1603
something different every day
1605
and with my kids um when i put them into
1607
bed and we say prayers and my oldest one
1609
andrew he's too cool for school whatever
1611
i don't i don't do president anymore
1614
he's but he's old or whatever but my
1616
other two kids i do
1617
uh and um during prayers i i asked them
1621
to thank god every night for something
1624
new
1625
uh and so the
1626
we've knew it for years it's i mean it's
1628
getting crazy now they're like thank you
1630
god for blue smarties but you know what
1632
i mean if you're grateful for something
1633
different see if we're still recording
1634
okay good if you're grateful for
1636
something different every single day uh
1638
it'll get you into peak mental states
1641
and so i practice gratitude
1643
every day before i get up you know i say
1645
prayer and i thank god for ten things in
1648
this order always
1650
andrew matthew dylan christine mom dad
1652
jamie k elizabeth and my students you
1655

1670

1673
so practice gratitude please a lot a lot
1676

1682
but friends loved ones
1685

1691
yeah and so your kids your spouse
1693
whatever your buddies that sort of thing
1696
be grateful for what you have and
1698
don't buy things
1699
by experiences
1703
okay next up your alma maters okay where
1707
you went to school the network matters a
1710
lot and so keep in contact it's a
1712
wonderful thing
1714
because a lot of times you'll learn more
1716
from your fellow classmates than you
1718
will from your teacher it's true it's
1721
true
1722
so one of the best networks you can have
1724
is a school network
1726
and you don't have to go to harvard
1727
business school for that
1728
any network really any network so your
1732
alma maters just remember that
1735
okay
1736
uh next up is a crucial post meeting
1740
networking best practice
1742
so it's really simple after every single
1745
meeting you have in business for the
1747
rest of your life
1749
that day
1750
i want you to connect with that person
1752
or the people you met that day using
1754
linkedin
1755
please do it please do it um because
1758
your your net worth is your your network
1760
so to speak uh and when people size you
1763
up uh and they look at at who you are
1766
and which contacts you have in common if
1768
you have a lot of secondary connections
1770
with somebody meaning uh contacts in
1773
common or whatever it is
1774
um
1775
then
1776
they're they're more likely gonna take
1778
you a little bit more seriously yeah
1780
it costs you nothing too it costs you
1782
nothing
1784
all right um and then um
1787
i think that's it yeah we're done now
1789
with uh with section number one which is
1791
relationships are more important
1793
than product knowledge
1795
