       "\"1\\nforeign\\n3\\n[Music]\\n9\\nmy name is Gustav and I work here at y\\n12\\ncombinator as a group partner I've been\\n14\\nhere since 2017. before YC I was a\\n17\\npractically to Airbnb and actually a YC\\n20\\nfounder back in 2007. today I'm going to\\n22\\ntalk about how to talk to your users and\\n25\\nyour future customers here's what I plan\\n27\\nto cover today why the best Founders\\n29\\ntalk to the users throughout the\\n31\\nlifetime of the company two how to find\\n33\\nyour users and how to talk to them three\\n35\\nwhat questions to ask them and what not\\n37\\nto ask them and four how to turn your\\n40\\nconclusions into an MVP most people in\\n42\\nthe world have the idea on how new\\n44\\nstartups to form completely wrong they\\n46\\nthink ideas of new products is something\\n48\\nthe financials come up with on a lazy\\n49\\nSunday or a late night coding session\\n51\\nyou probably know it doesn't work this\\n53\\nway this scene as you can see here here\\n55\\nis a scene from The Social Network movie\\n57\\nit's a great movie but they got a lot of\\n59\\nthings wrong on how Facebook actually\\n61\\ngot started this is Brian chesky Brian\\n63\\nis the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb on\\n66\\nthe left side of the photo is Amal Amal\\n68\\nwas the very first guest on Airbnb they\\n70\\nactually spent a weekend together in San\\n72\\nFrancisco when they'd be kind of watched\\n74\\nyou notice the difference between this\\n76\\nphoto and the previous photo well this\\n78\\nphoto actually is a real photo it\\n79\\nincludes a two-way conversation with a\\n81\\nreal customer great Founders talk to\\n83\\nFuture customers before they even have a\\n85\\nproduct in fact the very best Founders\\n88\\nin the world learn directly from their\\n90\\nusers throughout the life of their\\n92\\ncompany but that's again if you have\\n94\\ncorrectly identified who your users are\\n96\\nyou should learn from them throughout\\n98\\nthe lifetime of your company why you\\n100\\nmight ask\\n101\\nusers and customers will keep you honest\\n104\\nthey are the only stakeholders actually\\n106\\npaying you anything if anyone will tell\\n109\\nyou the truth it will be them so my talk\\n111\\ntoday is about how to do this well so\\n114\\nlet's talk about another m b story in\\n116\\n2010 um and I remember this uh myself\\n119\\nBrian chesky the CEO of Airbnb he'll\\n122\\ndecide to launch an experiment he was\\n124\\ngoing to give up his apartment and live\\n126\\nin 50 different airbnbs over the next\\n128\\ncouple of months you might ask yourself\\n129\\nwhy would anyone do that so much hassle\\n132\\nmost people read the articles about this\\n134\\nexperiment because he did announce it\\n135\\nthey missed a point\\n137\\num I personally remember this being kind\\n139\\nof crazy by doing this Brian will\\n141\\nliterally get a chance to talk to every\\n142\\none of these 50 hosts each single day on\\n145\\nthis trip and one incredible source of\\n147\\nhonest feedback on your product without\\n148\\nthe Airbnb hosts MB would not exist\\n151\\nexist today what Brian Joe and Nate did\\n153\\nso early is deeply understand the\\n155\\nmotivations\\n156\\num and the feedback from their hosts\\n158\\nstill today Brian and Joe gets calls\\n161\\nfrom hosts on their personal cell phone\\n163\\nnumbers I remember them telling me that\\n165\\nthat on their first day of adworks at\\n167\\nAirbnb\\n168\\nwhy do they do that well it's the number\\n170\\nthat they put on the website and share\\n172\\nwith all of their hosts early on they\\n174\\nweren't hiding behind Anonymous email\\n175\\nthey wanted to hear from the customers\\n177\\nat the time this seemed almost radical\\n180\\nmost Founders would spend their time in\\n182\\nfront of the computers trying to find\\n184\\nscalable growth channels like Google ads\\n186\\nunfortunately most Founders still don't\\n189\\nbuild personal connections with their\\n190\\nusers today behind behind info at emails\\n193\\nor don't do not reply emails you don't\\n197\\nbelieve me you should just do a search\\n198\\nin your email for do not reply at and\\n201\\nsee how many people don't want to talk\\n203\\nto their customers so let's start by\\n205\\ntrying to figure out who I should talk\\n207\\nto it's always easy to interview people\\n210\\nthat you know or people who are on your\\n212\\nnetwork they're simply the most likely\\n213\\nto respond but perhaps can be less\\n215\\nhonest in their answers to not offend\\n219\\nyou don't be afraid of reaching out to\\n221\\nthem and don't be afraid of rejection\\n223\\nthe second group here is co-workers or\\n225\\nformer co-workers they can be a really\\n227\\ngreat source they might know the topic\\n229\\nreally well and if you're building\\n231\\nsoftware for startups you can easily and\\n233\\neasily navigate yourself to someone\\n235\\nwho's a potential User it's also very\\n237\\ncommon that the early users you speak to\\n239\\nare outside of your personal circuits or\\n241\\nyour co-workers circles when asking YC\\n243\\nFounders how they found their early\\n245\\nusers some of the most common answers\\n247\\nwere LinkedIn red forms slack or Discord\\n250\\ncommunities and sometimes in-person\\n252\\nevents so to illustrate this process\\n255\\num a little better I'm going to start a\\n257\\nnew mock startup this is not a real\\n259\\ncompany I'm just making it up but I'm\\n261\\ngoing to go through the process as I\\n262\\nwould have if this was a real company\\n264\\nand first I want to understand if the\\n266\\nproblem is real my hypothesis that I\\n268\\nhave here or kind of like the idea space\\n270\\nthat we sometimes call as NYC is that\\n273\\ncompanies want to reduce their carbon\\n275\\nemissions but for whatever reasons don't\\n276\\ndo that so my plan is very simple I want\\n279\\nto first interview some potential\\n280\\ncustomers to learn about the problems\\n282\\nand motivations around carbon emissions\\n284\\nand three try to understand what an MVP\\n286\\nwill look like MVP is a minimal viable\\n288\\nproduct to do this research I plan to\\n291\\nstart by reaching out to Founders CEOs\\n293\\nCFOs at startups or bigger companies I'm\\n297\\nalso going to be shocked to people on\\n298\\nLinkedIn that have titles like\\n301\\ncarbon or climate or sustainability\\n304\\nbasically Wars that gives me hint that\\n307\\nthey might be relevant people to talk to\\n309\\nso what am I looking to learn well first\\n311\\nI'm trying to understand do the company\\n313\\nthat they work for care about their\\n315\\ncarbon emissions and two why do they\\n318\\ncare and why do they not care if they\\n320\\ndon't care and three who in that company\\n323\\nmight be the one who cares the most\\n325\\nabout this uh and why all right so so\\n327\\nhere are two examples of Outreach\\n329\\nmessages so the first one is a LinkedIn\\n331\\nmessage to a CFO who I used to work with\\n333\\nat Airbnb the message will go something\\n335\\nlike this first I introduce myself I\\n337\\nmentioned something about our time at\\n338\\nAirbnb then I say I'm starting a new\\n340\\nproject briefly describe it but not too\\n342\\nmuch in detail and I just asked for 20\\n344\\nminute phone call or video call that's\\n346\\nit and here's another example of a\\n348\\nmessage to someone I don't know it's\\n350\\nalso on LinkedIn to the same group that\\n352\\nI mentioned earlier it's similar but\\n354\\ngeared towards people I don't know so\\n356\\nthe message will and the tone will be a\\n357\\nlittle bit different all right so once I\\n360\\nget on the phone or once again on the\\n362\\nvideo call let's talk about uh how to\\n365\\nactually interview potential customers\\n367\\nso first you want to make sure that\\n369\\nthese interviews are over video calls\\n371\\nphone calls or in person you can learn a\\n373\\nlot more from a five minute video\\n375\\ninterview than 500 or 5 000 sugar\\n378\\nresponses\\n379\\nsecondly you want to build some Report\\n381\\nwith interviewee they're going to give\\n384\\nyou answers to questions that maybe no\\n385\\none have asked them before so you need\\n387\\nto make sure that they can trust you and\\n388\\nfeel comfortable in this situation next\\n390\\nuh the most important thing here the\\n392\\nmost most important thing here is to not\\n395\\nintroduce your idea until maybe at the\\n397\\nend of the call or maybe not at all\\n399\\ndoing this too early can bias them in\\n401\\ntheir answers your role here in this\\n404\\ninterview is to listen not to talk\\n407\\nthere are some great techniques to get\\n409\\npeople to open up and talk about their\\n411\\nproblems and one good one is to ask\\n413\\nfollow-up questions that are open-ended\\n415\\nfor example tell me about that if you're\\n418\\nnot recording the interview you should\\n420\\nat least take notes as much as you can\\n423\\nyou need to translate the recordings to\\n425\\nnotes anyway so you might as well take\\n427\\nnotes in the in the actual interview I'm\\n428\\ngoing to play an example video here on\\n431\\nuh how a potential customer for my\\n434\\ncarbon emission company and how that\\n436\\nconversation will go like Hi how are you\\n438\\num it's been a long time since we worked\\n440\\ntogether Airbnb\\n441\\nyeah great to see you\\n443\\nso I don't know if I told her this but\\n445\\nI'm thinking about starting another\\n446\\ncompany and I have a couple questions I\\n448\\nwanted to ask you about this era that\\n450\\nI'm interested in uh does your company\\n452\\nmontevue Inc do you care about your\\n454\\ncarbon emissions\\n456\\nwe do actually care and we use a\\n458\\nconsultant who creates these PDF reports\\n460\\nonce a year\\n461\\ninteresting uh what do you do with a\\n464\\nreport\\n465\\nI mean right now I don't think we really\\n467\\ntake much action on it unfortunately\\n470\\nwell why not\\n471\\nit's just really hard to know what to do\\n473\\nwith the information\\n475\\num the information is really dense and\\n477\\num uses words we don't really understand\\n480\\ntell me more about that\\n481\\nwell we hired this consultant\\n484\\num they asked us to fill out this word\\n486\\ndoc with information but most of the\\n488\\ndata that goes into it uh seems\\n490\\ninaccurate and I just feel like we need\\n493\\nanother expert to figure out what to do\\n495\\nwith the data\\n496\\ngot it got it\\n498\\num but why is it important for your\\n500\\ncompany at all to track carbon emission\\n502\\nwell our\\n509\\num and I think there's some regulations\\n510\\ncoming up too\\n512\\nyou notice here how I never introduced a\\n515\\nproduct or a solution I only ask\\n517\\nquestions to learn about the problem\\n519\\nthat Amy's having I don't even say what\\n521\\nI'm going to build\\n522\\nthat's how you want to do it here are\\n524\\nsome very specific questions that you\\n526\\ncan use in your interviews one tell me\\n528\\nhow you do X today by X of course I'm\\n531\\nreferring to a specific problem a task\\n533\\nor goal that you are trying to solve two\\n535\\nwhat is the hardest thing you are doing\\n537\\nabout x three why is it hard four how\\n541\\noften do you have to do x five why is it\\n544\\nimportant for your company to do X make\\n546\\nsure you dive deep into this question\\n547\\nlike understanding that motivation is\\n549\\ngoing to be critical here and six what\\n551\\ndo you do to solve this problem for\\n553\\nyourself today it's really important to\\n555\\nunderstand what they're doing\\n558\\nnow if you can watch them do this that's\\n561\\neven better if they can screen share\\n563\\nduring the video call or show you their\\n565\\nlaptop as you're doing the interview and\\n568\\nshow you how they actually get the PDF\\n570\\nreport what they do with it\\n572\\num how it looks like\\n573\\nthat's the ideal State you want to\\n576\\ndeeply understand their behavior not\\n577\\njust what they're saying but what\\n579\\nthey're doing because changing the\\n581\\nbehavior will be hard you can also ask\\n583\\nfollow-up questions and please learn how\\n585\\nto make use of these ones it's very hard\\n587\\nto get someone to say everything in just\\n589\\none answer to one question get\\n591\\ncomfortable with asking questions like\\n593\\nwhat do you mean by that or can you tell\\n595\\nme more about that or why is that\\n598\\nimportant to you here are some questions\\n599\\nthat you should not ask like there are\\n601\\nways you can kind of derail this\\n604\\ninterview will you use our product\\n606\\nthey're probably going to say yes but\\n608\\nthey're not going to mean anything to\\n609\\nyou the answer\\n611\\ntwo which features would make product X\\n614\\nbetter\\n615\\nremember their job is to tell you about\\n617\\nthe problem your job is to think about\\n619\\nwhat features to solve that problem so\\n622\\nasking them about your job isn't really\\n624\\ngoing to help you yes and no questions\\n627\\nit's not really that helpful for you you\\n629\\nwant them to explain and give you as\\n632\\nmany concrete and real examples as\\n635\\npossible so just simply asking yes no\\n636\\nquestions is not ideal here and four\\n639\\num how would would a better product X\\n642\\nlook like to you how would a better\\n644\\nCarbon emission counting software look\\n646\\nlike to you uh many of the people aren't\\n648\\nproduct developers they're not software\\n649\\nEngineers they're not designers they're\\n651\\nnot product managers this is not their\\n653\\njob their job is to do a different job\\n655\\nand you are the one trying to understand\\n658\\nwhat is the challenging part about their\\n660\\njob\\n661\\nand finally\\n663\\num asking two questions at the same time\\n665\\nthat's going to confuse them it's going\\n666\\nto confuse your answers so this is when\\n669\\nyou're eager to get um get answers it's\\n671\\nvery easy to do this this thing but try\\n673\\nto avoid it but I want to highlight one\\n675\\nof the things I mentioned here there's\\n676\\none big danger during interviews and\\n678\\nthat is to focus on features instead of\\n679\\nproblems\\n680\\nit's very natural for you to do that\\n682\\nyour bra your brain is thinking through\\n684\\nall the ways you're going to solve this\\n686\\nproblem\\n687\\nbut really what you're here for during\\n688\\nthis interview is to deeply understand\\n690\\nthe problems not actually come up with\\n692\\nSolutions that's for for us for a\\n695\\nseparate event so users generally have\\n698\\ngood problems but also generally bad\\n700\\nSolutions so I'll give you two specific\\n702\\nexamples so early days of Gmail users\\n705\\nwere asking\\n706\\num Paul Buchheit the founder of Gmail to\\n709\\nview both the Inbox and the actual email\\n712\\nthat they were reading on the same\\n713\\nscreen now why would they ask for that\\n715\\nwell the reason was simply that Gmail is\\n717\\ntoo slow and people did not want to wait\\n719\\nto load each of the emails in the inbox\\n721\\nthey want to see everything at the same\\n722\\ntime similarly in early Airbnb a lot of\\n725\\nguests want to have the phone numbers of\\n727\\nthe host so they can call them we're\\n729\\nlike why do you need that it just turned\\n732\\nout that they didn't fully trust the\\n733\\nplatform like we had not displayed\\n735\\nenough trust in Airbnb so they needed to\\n738\\nfeel comfortable uh with getting to know\\n739\\nthe host before it actually\\n741\\num making the booking secondly\\n743\\num users don't\\n745\\nhave incentive to say no to really any\\n748\\nadditional features if you ask for this\\n749\\nfeature or this feature this feature\\n750\\nthey'll probably say yes to everything\\n752\\nright you however are in charge of the\\n754\\nprojectations and you have a lot more\\n756\\nincentives than they have to figure out\\n758\\nwhich are the most important of the\\n761\\nfeatures so let's talk about next steps\\n763\\nso you've done your um five or ten of\\n765\\nthese user interviews you've written\\n767\\ndown your notes let's let's talk about\\n769\\nwhat you do then one you want to make\\n771\\nsure you have notes from all each of the\\n772\\ninterviews you can use sticky notes or\\n774\\nsome similar software to organize these\\n776\\nlearnings you can bucket them in\\n778\\ndifferent buckets that kind of describes\\n780\\ndifferent problems and see which one is\\n781\\nactually the thing that matters the most\\n783\\nand then you want to write down your\\n784\\nconclusions what are you learning from\\n786\\nall of this you want to use all of this\\n788\\ninformation to create a hypothesis or\\n790\\nwhat the solution to this problem might\\n791\\nbe don't over intellectualize this\\n793\\nprocess really you just want to start\\n794\\nassigning MVP as fast as you can but you\\n796\\nwant to make sure you have accurate\\n797\\ninformation when you decide the MEP and\\n800\\nthen you'll want to test it with the\\n801\\nsame users it's also important to know\\n802\\nif the problem you're solving is\\n804\\nactually valuable what I mean by this is\\n806\\nthat people will value the solution to\\n809\\nthe problem enough to pay for it or the\\n811\\nproblem itself solving the problem is\\n813\\nvaluable so here's some good tips to\\n815\\ndetermine if it is one are people paying\\n817\\nmoney for other Solutions in the space\\n819\\ntoday are the people that make the PDF\\n821\\nreports for carbon emissions accounting\\n822\\nare they getting paid well if they are\\n824\\ngetting paid that's a good sign that\\n825\\nthis is probably a valuable thing do\\n827\\npeople already have solutions to this\\n828\\nproblem they are very happy with even\\n830\\nthough it might appear Basics to you for\\n832\\nexample like Excel or Google\\n834\\nspreadsheets is actually competitors to\\n836\\nmany many many hundreds of startups\\n838\\nactually quite a formidable one to move\\n839\\nsomeone off Excel a Google spreadsheet\\n841\\nyou need to make the experience of your\\n843\\nsolution dramatically better they're not\\n845\\ngoing to pay you hundreds of dollars a\\n846\\nmonth for something they can almost as\\n848\\neasily do in Google spreadsheet or Excel\\n850\\nand three you want to evaluate how easy\\n852\\nit is to sell to this audience and this\\n854\\nis one thing that I like to do a lot\\n856\\nwith the companies I work with for\\n857\\nexample selling to Plumbers or\\n859\\ncontractors is notoriously difficult\\n861\\ncompared to selling to startups the\\n862\\nfirst two groups just don't change their\\n864\\ntools or the software very often versus\\n867\\nstartups are open to trying new things\\n869\\nall the time so if you are solving a\\n872\\nproblem is valuable you still have to\\n873\\nthink about whether it's going to be\\n875\\neasy to sell this particular audience\\n876\\nonce you have an MVP prototype you can\\n879\\nstart by showing it to users even if\\n881\\nit's just a design prototype in Envision\\n883\\nor something like that you can just\\n884\\nclick through we used to do this at MB\\n886\\nall the time we would go downstairs in\\n888\\nour in our office and we would find some\\n890\\npeople that were waiting for an\\n892\\ninterview or waiting for getting a\\n894\\ncoffee or something and we just show\\n895\\nthem the latest version of the app this\\n897\\nwould be a Envision prototype on our\\n899\\nphone it would be Spike hand them our\\n901\\nphone and and show it to them this is\\n903\\nstuff that we haven't even built yet the\\n905\\nkey thing but if you're doing this\\n906\\ntactic is to not tell them what to do do\\n911\\nnot tell them what to do just watch them\\n912\\nplay around with it you can tell them a\\n914\\nspecific goal like try to make a book in\\n916\\nAirbnb or try to do a search with dates\\n919\\nand even b or something like that but do\\n921\\nnot tell them exactly how to solve each\\n923\\nscreen remember if this was a real\\n925\\nproduct you wouldn't you wouldn't be\\n926\\nstanding there next to them to give them\\n927\\nadvice another good trick when you're\\n929\\ndoing this either when you're listening\\n931\\nor having them or recording them is to\\n934\\nhave them speak their mind while they're\\n935\\ndoing it have them describe exactly what\\n937\\nthey're thinking on each of the steps\\n939\\nmaybe the words that they're reading\\n941\\nmaybe that will give you hints of what\\n942\\nwords that they understand and which\\n944\\nwords they don't understand or maybe\\n945\\nwhat specific screen means or what\\n947\\npurpose is and after you've done a bunch\\n949\\nof these interviews and then maybe MVP\\n952\\nprotest sessions it's a great idea to\\n954\\nkeep these interviewees involved\\n956\\nthroughout the process\\n957\\none common idea that a lot of wasting\\n959\\ncompanies are using is to create a slack\\n961\\ninstance or a WhatsApp group for with\\n963\\ntheir customers now you want to make\\n965\\nthem feel special right you want to make\\n967\\nthem feel like they have exclusive\\n968\\nactive access to the Future world\\n971\\nchanging product so think about how\\n973\\nyou're wording or or how you communicate\\n976\\nthis WhatsApp group that you adding them\\n978\\nto it's a great idea to keep showing\\n979\\nthem your product as they are\\n981\\nprogressing like kind of give them this\\n983\\nexclusive feeling that I'm the first one\\n984\\nto see this product assets progressing\\n987\\nand also as you are\\n990\\nreacting to things that they're saying\\n992\\nyou can ship a new a new screen with a\\n994\\nnew version of the product\\n996\\num and that builds trust with it with\\n998\\nthem they now know that you react to\\n1000\\ntheir feedback very fast finally some of\\n1002\\nthem will love connecting with other\\n1004\\npeople doing the same thing as they are\\n1006\\nthey don't get to do this very often and\\n1009\\num you are the one enabling that if you\\n1011\\ndo all these steps you will collect the\\n1013\\nright information\\n1014\\num from your future users you will keep\\n1016\\nthem involved and transfer the\\n1019\\ninformation uh and that allow you to\\n1021\\ntransfer the information into your first\\n1022\\nprototype and MVP so to summarize here's\\n1025\\nwhat I covered today why the best\\n1027\\nFounders talk to their users throughout\\n1028\\nthe lifetime of the company\\n1030\\nhow to find your users and how to talk\\n1032\\nto them\\n1033\\nwhat questions to ask them and what not\\n1035\\nto ask them and finally how to turn some\\n1037\\nof those conclusions into an MVP thank\\n1040\\nyou everyone\\n1041\\n[Music]\\n\""

      "# How to Understand Your Startup Customers and Build an MVP\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello everyone, today let's break down how to understand your customers and use that understanding to build your Minimum Viable Product or MVP (The first simple version of your product). This is different from what you may think. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many people wrongly imagine that creating startups is something that busy money people dream up on a lazy Sunday, or that software folks crank out during a late-night coding marathon. If that's your idea, you're in for a surprise. It's not like that at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now you might recall a scene from the movie \"The Social Network\". It's a good film, but let me tell you, it gets a lot wrong about how a real startup like Facebook began. \n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, let me introduce you to Brian Chesky. He's the guy who co-started Airbnb. See him in this photo? On his left is Amal, the very first Airbnb guest. They hang out together in San Francisco for a weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you see a difference between this real-life photo and that movie scene? You've got it! This photo from real life shows a two-way chat with a genuine customer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smart starters of a business talk with future customers even before there's a product available. To be honest, the top achievers in the business field keep learning from their users throughout their company's life. But, of course, this comes after you've worked out who your real users are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should you learn from your customers, you ask? They're the only ones who really keep you honest. As the ones actually giving you money, they have the strongest stake in your offering. If there's anyone who'll tell you the real story, it's them. \n",
      "\n",
      "So in short, my friends, your customers are your chief guides in setting up and running your startup. Never forget that. Got it? Good.\n",

      "# A Lesson in User Engagement through the Airbnb Story\n",
      "\n",
      "The most successful brands are those that openly engage with their users, truly understanding their needs and motivations. One such example comes from **Airbnb** and its CEO, *Brian Chesky*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take a stroll down memory lane to 2010. Picture this: *Brian Chesky*, Airbnb's CEO, deciding to live in 50 different Airbnb homes over the span of a few months. You're probably thinking, \"Why put himself through all that trouble?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "God is in the details, folks, and many missed the deep purpose behind this move. It might have seemed like a wild idea, but let me tell you, it was an inspired one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian's living experiment provided him the golden opportunity to directly engage with 50 different hosts, one-on-one on each day of his journey. Think about it - what could be a more real, direct source of honest feedback than that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Without Airbnb hosts, the platform wouldn't be what it is today. So, what Brian and his co-founders Joe and Nate did was to deeply engage with and understand their hosts. To this day, Brian and Joe still receive calls from hosts on their private numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't hide behind faceless \"info\" or \"do not reply\" emails - they gave their direct contact details to hosts. For a time, this was considered a rather wild idea. While most founders turned their focus on scalable growth channels like Google Ads, they remained front and centre with their customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, not many leaders follow this approach today. Often hiding behind anonymous email addresses, they lose personal connection with their users. Skeptical? Look for 'do not reply' emails in your inbox and see how many there are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being accessible to your users is not just a nice-to-do, but rather, it's a must-do. Especially in the startup world, understanding and engaging with your users can be the difference between a brand's success and its failure. Let's learn, shall we, from Airbnb's playbook.\n",

      "\n",
      "As you get your startup going, it's important to **understand your audience**. This could be talking to your customers, your network, or even your co-workers. Here are two main groups you should consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "-   **Your personal network**: It might seem simple, but people who know you are more likely to answer your questions. Just remember, they might not be fully honest because they might not want to hurt your feelings. Don't let the fear of rejection stop you from reaching out to them!\n",
      "\n",
      "-   **Your co-workers or former colleagues**: These are great people to talk to because they already understand your work and might be potential users of your product, particularly if you're building software for startups. They may also bring to you potential users outside of your personal or professional circles. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can you find these early users? Many startup founders commonly use LinkedIn, online forums, chat communities like Slack or Discord, or sometimes even in-person events!\n",
      "\n",
      "## Building a Mock Startup\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's try to understand the whole process by creating a **mock startup**. This isn't a real company, but let's pretend as though it is. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our startup's goal is to help companies reduce their carbon emissions. Our plan is simple: \n",
      "\n",
      " 1. Interview potential customers to understand the problems and motivations around carbon emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. Try to define what our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will look like. \n",
      "\n",
      "To do my homework, my plan is to connect with folks in the roles like founders, CEOs, CFOs, along with people possessing interesting titles related to carbon, climate, or sustainability on LinkedIn.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Learning and Understanding \n",
      "\n",
      "What are we trying to learn from this? Three main things: \n",
      "\n",
      "-   Does the company they work for care about their carbon emissions?\n",
      "-   Why do they care or not care about their carbon emissions?\n",
      "-   Who in that company might be the one who cares the most about this, and why?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Example Messages for Outreach \n",
      "\n",
      "Once you identify who to talk to, here are a few sample messages to start a conversation:\n",
      "\n",
      "-   For CFO at my former company: \n",
      "\n",
      "    >Hi [Name], \n",
      "    I hope you're doing well since our time at [Company]. I'm working on a new project, and I wondered if I could chat with you for about 20 minutes to get your thoughts?\n",
      "\n",
      "-   For a person I don't know, with relevance to carbon emissions:\n",
      "\n",
      "    >Hi [Name], \n",
      "    I hope this message finds you well. I'm currently working on a project aimed at helping companies reduce their carbon emissions. Would you care for a quick chat on this topic?\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's it! I hope this lecture helps you understand the importance of knowing your audience, reaching out to them, and asking them the right questions. Good luck!\n",

      "# Customer Interviews: A Brief Guide\n",
      "Hello class, today we're going to chat about how to interview potential customers for your startup. It might feel new, but don't worry, with a few tips, you'll be able to master it in no time.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, **do these interviews face-to-face**, over video calls, or phone calls. You can learn a lot more in a 5-minute video talk than from many written answers. Also, remember to **make your guest feel at ease**. They'll be sharing insights that maybe no one has asked them before, so it's crucial they trust you and feel comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you ready for the most, most important thing? Here it is: **Keep your idea for later, maybe at the end of the call, or maybe not at all**. Talking about it too soon might lead them to give answers that they think you want to hear. In this interview, your job is to listen, not talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "One good way to get people to talk about their problems is to ask follow-up questions that don't have a 'yes' or 'no' answer. For example, \"Tell me about that.\" And if you're not recording the interview, **try to take as many notes as you can.**\n",
      "\n",
      "For better understanding, let’s dive into a pretend chat I have with a potential customer for my imaginary carbon emission company.\n",
      ">“Hi, when we worked together at Airbnb, did your company care about carbon emissions? … What did you do with the reports? … Why didn’t you act on them? … Why is it important for your business to track emissions?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the chat, I steer clear of suggesting any products or solutions. I only ask questions to get to know the problem better. That's how you should approach it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few questions you can use:\n",
      "1. \"Tell me how you do _X_ today.\" (With _X_ being the problem or task you’re trying to solve.)\n",
      "2. \"What's the hardest part of doing _X_?\"\n",
      "3. \"Why is it hard?\"\n",
      "4. \"How often do you do _X_?\"\n",
      "5. \"Why is it important for your business to do _X_?\" (Understanding the motivation behind this is very important.)\n",
      "6. \"What ways do you use to solve this problem now?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, **try to understand their behavior, not just what they're saying but what they're doing**. Changing behavior is hard, so knowing what they do now is essential. If you can see them do the task in real-time during the interview, that's perfect!\n",
      "\n",
      "To wrap up, asking the right questions helps us get the right information we need to understand our potential customers better. The more we know, the better we can shape our business to meet their needs. Let's keep practicing, and remember, listening is key.\n",

      "**How to Ask Effective Questions**\n",
      "\n",
      "When starting a business, asking questions to the right people can be very important. But it's not always easy to change someone's behavior, so it'll be helpful if you know the right way to ask questions. Learn to ask follow-up questions too because it can be hard to get all the information you need from just one question.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get more information, here are some follow-up questions you might use: 'What do you mean by that?', 'Can you tell me more about that?', or 'Why is that important to you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are also types of questions you hould avoid asking. These ones can sometimes put the conversation off-track:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **'Will you use our product?'** - People might say yes, but it may not mean anything to you. They might just be trying to be nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **'Which features would make Product X better?'** - Remember, it's your job to figure out what features would solve their problems, not theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Yes/no questions** - These types of questions don't really add a lot to the conversation. They don't provide you with concrete examples or real, useful information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **'How would a better Product X look to you?'** - Most people you'll be talking to are not product developers, software engineers, designers, etc. That's not their job. Their job is to do something else and your job is to understand what is difficult about their job.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Double-barreled questions** - Asking two questions at once can confuse people and mix up their answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember not to be too eager to get all the answers at once. Take one step at a time and build a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve.\n",

      "# Lecture: Understanding User Problems Over Features\n",
      "\n",
      "Good day everyone! Today, we're going to discuss listening to your users during interviews. You may be buzzing to get quick answers, it might seem the easy thing to do, but we need to step back a little. An important point I want to underline is a common mistake during customer talks: focusing more on the features of your product instead of the issues your users face. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's human nature to do this. As the problem solver at heart, you're already trying to find solutions to these issues. But here's the crucial thing: interviews are there to get to the heart of what troubles users, rather than brainstorm solutions. We'll save problem-solving for another time. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see, users generally spot good problems but might not be the best at coming up with solutions. I want to share two real world examples with you to illustrate this point. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take the early days of Gmail. Many users asked Paul Buchheit, Gmail's creator, for a chance to see both their inbox and the actual email message all in one go. You might wonder why. The simple reason was that Gmail was a bit of a slowpoke back then, making people wait to load each email. So, they wanted to see everything at once to save time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, Airbnb. In its initial phase, many guests wanted the phone numbers of their hosts. But why, you might ask. Well, it turned out that guests were not fully sure they could trust Airbnb. They felt better getting to know their host before booking a stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's another important note to remember: users will generally not say no to extra features. If you offer a bundle of features, they will most likely say yes to all of them. However, remember that you're the captain of this ship. You are responsible for what goes into your product and it's up to you to figure out what's essential. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, when talking to users, lean towards understanding their problems instead of displaying your product features. This will help you make well-informed decisions for your product. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# Let's Discuss the Next Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you've just completed your first few user interviews. You've got about five or ten under your belt, and you've been dutifully documenting everything in the process. What do you do next? Let's break it down into simple steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gather Your Notes:** The first thing you want to do is to make sure you've captured notes from every single interview. You can use things like sticky notes or a simple computer program to keep everything organized.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sort Out Your Learning:** You can group what you've learned into different piles. Each pile might reflect a different problem that you've identified. The goal here is to find out which problem is the most important one that needs solving.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Write Down Your Conclusions:** What have you learned from these interviews? Write it all down. This will help you digest everything and make sense of all the information you've gathered.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Form a Hypothesis:** Using all this information you've gathered, think about what the solution to the problem might be. Don't make this too complicated, keep it simple. You're just making an educated guess at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Start Building Your MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Using your hypothesis, start building your MVP as quickly as you can. You want to test this MVP with the information you've gathered. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the goal here isn't to overthink the process or get buried in details. You want to get going on your MVP as quickly as possible, but you also want to make sure you're informed by the user interviews you've conducted. Happy building!\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# A Simple Guide on Deciding, Testing, and Valuing Your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you're ready to make your MVP, or **the simplest form of your product** that you'll show to users. That's great! However, it's vital to ensure that the issue you're trying to fix is really worth fixing. In other words, are people ready to pay for a solution to the problem? Is the problem so important that solving it is valuable? With this, let me take you through three simple ways to figure this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Point 1: Check If There Is Money to Be Made\n",
      "The first thing you need to do is see if people are already spending money on solutions to the problem. For example, let's say your product can make carbon emissions reports. Are the folks who currently do this job getting paid well? If they are, that's great news! This could mean your solution might also be valued.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Point 2: Know Your Competitors\n",
      "Next, find out if people are already happy with solutions they have. This might sound basic, but it's crucial. Simple tools like Excel or Google spreadsheets can be big competition to many new businesses. If you want to get people to leave these tools, your product needs to be much, much better. No one would want to pay a lot of money for something that can be done almost the same way in Google spreadsheet or Excel.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Point 3: Understand If Your Product is Easy to Sell \n",
      "Finally, think about how easy or hard it is to sell to your audience. In my experience, selling to groups like plumbers or contractors can be quite hard. They don't often change their tools or software. However, startups are always eager to try new things. Even if your product does solve a problem, it's important to think if it's going to be easy to sell it to your audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, once you have the prototype of your MVP ready, you can start testing and improving it. Remember, the best product is one that not only solves a problem but also is wanted by the customer. This is the key to success in the startup world.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# Selling to Your Audience: A Simple Guide to Testing Your Startup MVP\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi everyone! Today, let's talk about how to sell your product to your target audience. Guess what? You don't have to wait for a finished product to start pitching your idea! A *Minimum Viable Product* or **MVP** can be just a simple example of what the finished product might look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Using a Design Prototype\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't have to get technical right away. Even something as basic as a design prototype – created in a tool like *Envision* or something similar - can give your potential customers an idea of what the final product will look like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember how we did things at *MB*? We used the easiest way - we would simply walk downstairs in our office, find someone who was waiting for a coffee or an interview, and show them the newest version of our planned app.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Handling the Prototype: The Key Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "Here you need to focus on the most critical part. **Don't tell** them what to do with the prototype. Let them explore. Give them a gentle push, perhaps a basic task, something like \"try to book a room on Airbnb\" or \"search for dates\", but don't guide them on how to achieve it step by step. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, if this was a real product, you wouldn't be standing next to them to assist, would you?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Making the Most of User Experience\n",
      "\n",
      "A neat trick to get the most of  this experience? Ask them to voice their thoughts while they use the prototype. Ask them to explain what they're thinking at each step, which words they understand, which they don't, or what they believe a specific screen or feature is meant for.\n",
      "\n",
      "By doing this, you get to understand your potential users better and refine your product to suit their needs and expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "And that's it! Testing your MVP this way can bring you closer to a product that really meets the needs of your target audience. Do remember, it may take several rounds and iterations, but with each step, you will be moving closer to a successful product. I hope this has been helpful. Happy experimenting!\n",
