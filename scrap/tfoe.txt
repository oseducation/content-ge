22
business schools do a pretty good job of
24
providing students with theoretical
27
frameworks which can sometimes be
29
applied to real world problems
32
however
34
quite often they overlook the most
36
crucial and practical business lessons
38
like how to network how to find
40
customers or how to get a job
43
if you want to learn how to get a
44
meeting with almost anyone or take your
47
career to the next level then this
49
course is for you
51
i've worked at goldman sachs
53
i've met with top business people
55
including bill gates warren buffett and
57
the founders of the biggest technology
59
companies and at the end of all my
61
meetings with these visionaries
63
i've always asked them for advice on
65
what made them so successful
67
and a lot of what they taught me is not
69
taught in business school so i put
71
together a list of every lesson and i've
74
included it in this book and in this
77
course
80
[Music]
84
these lessons will help you take your
85
career to the next level
87
it's exciting to reinvent yourself in
89
ways that you never thought were
90
possible
92
until you realize it is possible
96
anything is possible as many of my
99
students that have taken this course
100
i've realized
103
[Music]
109
[Music]
112

113
passion into this course
115
and i'm humbled to say
117
that business insider wrote an article
119
stating that my book 101 crucial lessons
122
they don't teach you in business school
124
was voted as the number one business
126
book of the year
127
also forbes magazine stated
130
that this book is one of six books that
133
every entrepreneur needs to read right
134
now
137
so let me teach you about these crucial
139
business lessons

[Music]
154
in november of
155
2015 uh one of my clients when i worked
159
full-time in venture capital had an
160
extra ticket to go to the tony robbins
163
uh event
164
called upw meaning unleash the power
167
within uh down in los angeles uh and so
169
i i i graciously accepted and i went
172
down
173
and in la i think it was at the staples
175
center or a very large convention center
177
there's ten thousand people in the
178
audience it was crazy it was awesome
180
and it was a four-day event
182
and we went through a lot of exercises
185
goal setting workshops etc
188
and then
189
including walking across hot fire coals
192
on the saturday night
194
and tony conditioned us tony robbins
197
and i actually ended up meeting him
198
another time for business really reasons
200
really nice guy but and when i shook his
202
hand his hand like wrapped around my
203
hand he's a big dude big dude but a
206
really nice guy as well
208
but what he did was on the saturday
210
night of that four-day event back in
213
2015
215
he
216
had us walk across boiling hot coals
219
like it looked like lava
221
and he conditioned us to
223
believe
224
in our mind that we're not going to feel
226
any pain at all
229
he conditioned us to do that and so i
230
walked across the coals
232
and i didn't feel any pain at all it was
234
exhilarating and of course i had lots of
235
fire hoses there just in case whatever i
238
didn't feel any pain it was amazing
240
uh and and i went back to my hotel it
243
was actually an airbnb that night uh in
244
in la
246
and i um i i couldn't sleep because i
249
was excited but also because there's
250
blisters in my feet and i had to take a
252
bunch of advil
253
my feet were fine though
255
but that that event kind of changed me
257
it really changed me and on the sunday
260
of that four day event uh what tony
262
robbins did was he said that
265
write down your goals
266
and he then said
268
i want you to think of one particular
270
goal
271
that you've been kind of putting off for
272
a while in your life
274
and what i want you to do is i want you
276
to write down that goal
277
and i also want you to write down a
279
deadline date
281
okay most most people don't set deadline
282
dates for goals
284
and so what i did was i was writing this
285
book for a couple of years you know uh
288
and it's this book back here of course
290
101 crucial lessons i don't teach in
292
business school
293
and
294
i
295
every time i met with somebody very very
296
successful i'd ask for advice and i
299
documented
300
and then what happened was um i wrote
302
down a deadline date that sunday before
304
i flew back home the fourth day of the
306
conference
307
and i wrote i'll finish this book in two
309
or three weeks
311
and i flew home
312
and it was a sunday night
314
then on a monday morning i went into
316
work
318
and there's three general partners of
320
ours in the firm myself included
322
and i i just wasn't into it my heart
326
wasn't into work that day
328
and so around noon that day on that
330
monday i said i'm i'm gonna
332
i'm gonna i'm gonna go home guys i'll
333
i'll see ya i'm just not feeling it and
335
they were cool they're like all right
336
chris we'll see you tomorrow or whenever
338
right so
340
um and and i could do that because there
342
was there's three of us owned the fund
344
so i went home
346
and i started writing a little bit on
348
that monday
350
and then i couldn't stop it was like
352
that jerry maguire movie um and when tom
355

384
up not really going back to work i kind
386
of did for a while but i wasn't into it
389
but
390
it that that changed me that event and
392
that led me to want to just
394
live my life my own terms and embrace my
397
passion which is teaching and up to that
399
point i had been teaching during the
401
evenings at a couple san francisco bay
403
area business schools mba and undergrad
406

415

417

421

463
when to go to the book uh and and when

to do the exercises let me just
467
rearrange my screen here and touch uh
469
there's a quote here um from this kind
472
of ugly guy who has awful doubt humor
475
um but he's a bit humble sometimes the
478
quote is the best entrepreneurs don't
480
think that the glass is half empty or
482
half full they believe that the glass is
485
overflowing
487
and i really do believe that you know i
489
always see the positives in life always
491
always always you know what we think we
493
perceive you know thoughts your thoughts
495
become reality
497
um so um yeah we're 28 through other way
500
through uh this this course right now uh
502
and so as i mentioned before um we're
504
going to go through this book this book
506
uh in a lot a lot of detail a lot of
508
detail and uh i published this um not
512
only on um on on kindle but also amazon
515
the print version uh and many of my
517
students uh i'm so happy to hear
519
uh have started to publish your own
520
books as well and i've got copies in
523
here
524
uh and i also published it on on on
527
audible.com i went to acx.com and did it
530
there and that's the cover of the book
532
from audible and i have the cover of the
534
book made by some dude um i can't
536
remember where he is actually no it was
538
a woman actually actually her name is
540
ultra contu
541
on fiverr.com and she's based in
543
bangladesh and she's great so she made
545
this cover yeah
546
yeah um and then uh what happened was
549
i'm humbled to say that uh per this this
551
video here um
553
it was
554
forbes wrote an article saying this is
556
one of six books every entrepreneur
558
should read right now along with lean
559
startup zero to one by peter thiel uh
562
the self-made um billionaire effect
565
start with why by simon sinek and the
567
seven habits of highly effective people
569
by stephen covey i actually went to
570
business school at columbia with stephen
572
covey covey's kit yeah
574
so this this kind of changed my life uh
576
this this book uh and i i was very
579
transparent in this book
581
and i find that it's easier for me uh to
584
read social media posts or books or
586
articles if they're very very short when
588
i was a kid i loved reading books by
591
roald dahl
593
he made james and the giant peach
595
and charlie in the chocolate factory and
597
that influenced me because roald dahl
599
that his chapters were very very short
601
it was just easy for me to to go through
603
it and that's what i did with this book
605
here as well i kept the chapters very
607
very short uh and i'm humbled to say
610
that it was also the number three
612
bestseller i think the kindle version
613
for a while on on on amazon it's still
615
it's since trailed off a bunch troll off
618
a bunch yeah
619
but i had a lot of fun put this together
620
so there's 17 sections in the book
624
and we're going to talk about the book
625
in two different parts and so as i
627
mentioned before
628
the first half of the book is today's
630
is in today's workbook we're gonna do
632
sections one through eight uh and then
635
next class um we're gonna do the second
638
half of the book and discuss sections
641
nine through seventeen okay so let me
644
show you what that means so if you go
646
here to to the workbook
648
um you'll see here that this is more
650
than 50 pages and it might be the page
653
link might be a little bit different
654
depending on how many notes you take
656
in this workbook
657
as well as if you're using it on a
659
different form factor or pdf version
662
or the the word version microsoft word
664
version but the contents are the same
666
and so what i'll do is i will ask you to
668
click on these numbers
670
every now and then to start doing
672
exercises and i'll make it very very
673
intuitive to know exactly how to do this
675
and when as well
677
and so
678
you click here
679
and then you click down here now
681
if you can't see a hyperlink here after
684
you click this then go up here and just
685
click section one two three etc and what
688
i did also
690
was
691
i put here the table of contents for the
693
first half of the book
695
and if you're using the microsoft word
697
version of this document or the google
699
docs version you can click on any of
701
these to jump right to these chapters in
703
in the book
704
um it doesn't work i don't think on the
707
pdf version so just scroll to where you
709
should be
710
so i included actually all of um
713
all the content of the book the first
715
half at least today and i'll include the
716
next half of the book in next class's
718
workbook so if you go here to section
721
one
722
i i talk about here high level what we
724
cover in section one
726
i had a lot of fun with 3d images today
728
too
729
and then if you want you can type your
731
notes here
732
for lesson number one
734
and below each
736
lesson title
738
is the actual text from the book and
740
don't read this
741
during class read it during during
742
homework or on the side if you want to
744
it's optional completely
746
so you can take notes here on on lesson
749
number one if you want to and what
750
you've learned
753
and what you can also do is if you go to
755
the next lesson here number two you can
758
take notes here again and again there's
760
a text here from that chapter they're
762
very short
763
and you have to read the entire thing
765
you can skim it or read another day
768
all right so let me go back here to the
769
top just we're on the same page does
772
that work oh yeah good
773
there we go good
775
all right so um as i talk about all 101
779
lessons in today's class and next class
781
as well um you can take down notes as i
783
just showed you
785
in in the uh
787
in the workbook you downloaded today
789
so let's start now with with topic
791
number one
793
so uh
794
section number one uh is called
797
relationships are more important than
799
product knowledge um and uh i have a
802
little catch phrase for all all the
804
sections in the book so the first cache
806
phrase for section one is crucial
807
networking tips to make you more
809
successful now
810
we've covered a bunch of this before so
812
i'm just going to go over what we've
814
already covered very quickly so i can
816
focus much more attention on the new
817
stuff but it's always important to
820
re-emphasize what i've taught you before
822
because
823
repetition is the mother of all skill
826
okay so the very first lesson is steve
829
jobs winning strategy uh how to get
832
anything you want
834
um and and if you're watching the replay
835
i mean the non-live version of this
837
lecture uh what you can do if you want
839
uh is
840
you can actually go to um
842
go to chapter one here or i should say
844
uh the uh lesson number one by going
847
here
848
and what you can do is just click on
850
this video here to watch a
852
short video of steve jobs uh and if you
854
don't want to click on this you can just
855
search for three words uh in uh in
858
youtube which are steve jobs ask
860
um and
862
you will never get anything you want in
864
life now if you don't ask
867
and when we were younger
869
growing up um we were kids
872
we asked our parents all the time for
875
stuff you know like my youngest one
877
drives me crazy i love them though he
879
says dad can i have some candy i'll say
881
no
882
literally a minute later he'll say can i
883
ask him kenny now
885
no and then he'll ask again like five
887
he's relentless relentless
890
uh and then what happens is you stop
892
asking once you've been conditioned to
894
stop doing that for whatever reason um
898
and and you can be tactful when you ask
900
and not overdo it and upset people
902
obviously but what happens is once we're
904
done with high school
906
for a lot of us when we go to a
907
university or or start our first job
909
whatever it is
911
we don't really ask for anything because
913
we learn that if we keep our heads down
915
and we get good grades
917
then everyone's proud of us and life
919
works better
920
but then what happens is many years into
922
your career
924
you wake up one day and you look around
926
and you think to yourself my goodness
929
why are all these other people around me
932
getting uh getting promoted
934
and not me
935
why are all these other less capable
937
people
938
around me getting raises and not me
942
and you realize and it might be too late
944
or it's never too late but sometimes it
947
it takes you to your 40s till you
948
realize this
950
that if you want a raise or promotion
952
you have to ask
953
nobody's ever made ceo or ever raised a
956
lot of money as an entrepreneur without
959
asking over and over and over and over
961
again
962
and do you ever see somebody that is is
964
kind of average looking
967
and uh their significant other is
970
unbelievably attractive
972
and
973
you wonder what's going on
976
why how did that happen and it's not
978
always about money okay
979
um it's it's because the the person
982
that's less attractive and and we we
983
refer to this usually as the matching
985
principle in psychology
987
you know people that are they're both
988
very good looking usually end up dating
991
but there's always
993
an exception and many exceptions and
995
it's not just about money
998
it's about the person who
1001
is
1002
maybe average looking or whatever
1004
just thinking themselves
1006
i've got nothing to lose and everything
1007
to gain i'm going to keep asking people
1009
out over and over and over again because
1011
i know
1012
that the pain from being rejected a
1014
bunch of times is nothing
1016
compared to the pleasure which is
1018
massive
1019
of being of this person saying yes to a
1022
date so to speak you got to be
1024
relentless and a lot of entrepreneurs
1027
are like that as well
1028
they're they're relentless they they
1030
they just don't stop they're aggressive
1033
they're aggressive and and they just
1034
don't they really don't care what people
1036
think of them either and that's why
1037
they're very very successful they don't
1039
give a damn what people think yeah
1043
so
1044
you got to be the same way as well sorry
1046
my stomach's grambling trembling here i
1048
got this new ninja bullet thing and i'm
1050
it's my new diet here
1055
kale blueberries etc gives me energy
1058
so you got to ask
1060
if you want anything in life you got to
1062
ask over and over and over and over and
1064
over and over again
1066
kind of like michael jordan i feel over
1068
and over and over again and that's why i
1070
succeed
1071
don't forget that please don't forget
1073
that you got to ask
1075
ask often be a pain in the neck and
1078
don't give a damn if you get rejected
1080
who gives a damn
1081
you know jk rowling she you know she she
1084
got rejected by like 29 or 30 publishers
1087
she didn't give a damn that people
1088
thought she was a failure who cares
1090
on the 30th they said yes and she's a
1092
billionaire now
1095
all right let's move on now to number
1097
two um how to get a job and why sending
1100
in a resume can be a waste of time there
1103
is a better way
1105
but even if you have an amazing resume
1106
and an amazing linkedin profile it's not
1108
enough
1109
you're gonna have to network like crazy
1111
you're gonna have to do a ton of
1113
informational meetings that's how you
1115
get jobs in this new digital reality
1117
that's just how it works
1119
because if you apply online you're one
1121
of a thousand people applying for a job
1123
and the dude that gets the job is
1124
usually the one that knows somebody at
1127
the company
1128
so and we've covered this a lot before
1129
so i'm gonna skip over this one here uh
1131
but your your your network is your net
1133
your your net worth yeah
1137
all right next up is uh business is
1139
about people and not about what you know
1142
um you know a big rookie mistake is
1145
going to any business meeting and just
1146
talking about business right away that
1148
doesn't matter dude
1150
it doesn't matter most jobs in the world
1152
are sales
1154
and
1155
most ceo roles
1157
you're a salesperson and if you're a
1159
partner in a law firm
1160
don't be a part of a law firm but if
1162
you're a partner in a law firm uh or or
1164
in a venture capital firm you're a sales
1166
person as well
1168
so how do they do it well they do it by
1170
bonding and we've talked a lot about
1172
this before bond before business
1174
so business is about people
1176
and and not what you know it's important
1178
to reinforce that
1180
now
1180
what you have to do also is uh in in i
1183
knew a guy
1184
who is the head of government sales at
1187
ibm in dc
1189
and i had um i had dinner with him one
1192
night with him and with uh mohit aaron
1195
uh who's the founder of a great company
1196
called cohisti when i was on mohit's
1198
board
1199
and uh it was a great it was a great
1201
dinner we we had dinner in palo alto and
1204
because this dude
1205
was at ibm and in a very senior role
1207
i asked him you know i said how did you
1209
get to where you got
1211
and he talked about how he learned a lot
1213
from working actually in politics and i
1216
said oh what do you mean by that he said
1218
well in in the early 90s i worked for
1221
george bush senior in the white house
1224
and uh i was like oh my gosh this is
1227
amazing i got to ask you questions
1229
um and so i asked him i said can you
1231
please give me
1233
the most important lesson you learned
1235
from work in the white house for bush
1236
senior why was he successful
1240
and this guy told me he said it's
1242
because uh
1243
bush senior would treat people like
1245
celebrities and celebrities like people
1249
so
1250
if if you ever meet a celebrity or
1252
somebody very senior in your company
1254
just treat like a dream like a normal
1255
person they'll feel uncomfortable if you
1257
treat me differently
1259
and if you meet somebody who's not so
1261
important whatever on how you classify
1263
what not so important means
1264
treat them like a celebrity as well you
1266
know ask a lot of questions ask them a
1268
lot of questions you know where'd you
1270
grow up and that sort of thing and just
1273
just learn from them just bond
1275
and don't forget to say people's names
1277
at least once or twice during during a
1279
longer conversation it's more personable
1281
that way
1282
and after you meet with anybody
1284
um connect with them immediately on
1286
linkedin as well and just remember their
1288
name and while you're going off script
1289
here but while you're talking to them
1291
what you got to do is
1293
you got to visualize and think about
1296
how you're going to remember their name
1298
and so
1299
uh when i was 19 i actually did the dale
1302
carnegie public speaking program
1306
and
1307
there's this woman named uh cynthia
1310
mustachio
1311
and i met her once there back when i was
1314
19 like
1315
ages ago last century
1318
and her name was cynthia mustachio but i
1320
remember thinking to myself every time i
1322
see her i'm going to think she has a big
1324
mustache
1325
and so that's how i remember cynthia
1327
mustachio
1328
and you got to do the same thing as well
1329
what you can do is you when you when you
1331
meet people because it's really
1332
embarrassing man like if you go to a a
1334
party or something
1336
and you forget somebody's name
1338
it's embarrassing to just say hey you
1341
which is what i do sometimes to be
1342
intellectually honest
1344
but what i what i do it's awful for me
1346
it's the worst for me because my wife's
1348
name is the same name as me her name is
1349
christine i'm chris
1351
so everybody remembers chris and
1352
christine
1354
and so we go to parties and and i i do
1356
this actually this i probably shouldn't
1358
tell you this trick i'm going there
1359
anywhere i don't care fully transparent
1361
as always
1362
so if christine is beside me at a party
1365
and there's somebody beside me and i
1366
have no idea what their name is i forget
1369
i go like this i scratch my neck and
1371
then christine jumps in and introduces
1373
herself
1374
and at the end of the night i've lost
1376
like eight layers of skin just kidding
1378
on my neck yeah but it works but you got
1380
to remember people's names and do name
1382
association as well
1384
if you can and so when you meet somebody
1386
if their first name uh is uh similar to
1390
a rock star's name or the same as a rock
1392
star's name uh then just think of it
1395
that way like if you meet somebody named
1397
bob
1398
um just just think of bob dylan you know
1400
singing a song or in an interview saying
1402
hey
1403
you know you can't really understand it
1405
but it's it's silly visualization i get
1407
it but you'll never forget it yeah yeah
1411
all right
1412
all right uh next and and also um
1417
not not just rock stars but think of i
1419
think of actors as well when you meet
1421
somebody or something really really
1423
silly really silly like like cynthia
1425
mustachio
1427
okay moving on
1429
all right next up um i want you to meet
1431
people have fun and learn and there's no
1433
reason why i threw in baby yoda here
1435
other than the fact that i think that
1436
baby yoda is adorable
1438
um
1440
no but in all seriousness um
1443
when i went down to wall street to work
1444
at goldman i was so nervous man i i was
1448
nervous because i i thought and i
1450
remember that time really well i had
1452
nirvana's song in my head dumb
1455
nirvana had it
1456
one of the early albums it was great
1458
there's a song called dumb
1460
and it goes i think i'm dumb i think i'm
1462
dumb and i remember when i was at
1463
goldman i remember thinking to myself
1466
if i don't say anything ever to anybody
1469
they might think i'm dumb
1471
but if i actually open my mouth and
1473
start talking they'll know i'm dumb
1475
and then the kirk cobain track would go
1477
on and on and on in my head
1479
perception becomes reality you got to
1481
get that out of your mind and so i told
1483
myself three things which assuaged my
1485
concerns you know when i went down and
1488
in hindsight i would have told myself
1489
fourth and the fourth thing would have
1490
been god already knows what's gonna
1492
happen so just don't worry just enjoy it
1495
don't question your faith
1497
but the three things i told myself at
1498
the time when i went down to goldman um
1501
was and i and i loved the power of three
1502
as you know uh in all my presentations
1504
and in everything
1506
um
1507
you know
1507
what i would say was uh i all i want to
1510
do is i want to meet people
1511
have fun and learn that's it
1515
those are my goals
1517
that's it
1518
and it was great
1519
because i met a ton of people my network
1521
is amazing partially because of that
1523
i enjoyed it i had fun i never saw it as
1526
works i conditioned myself to enjoy it i
1528
learned a ton and once you stop learning
1530
you got to move on to another job
1533
so if you're you're ever nervous about a
1536
new job
1537
don't worry because when you start a
1538
brand new job i don't care how old or
1540
young you are they're not going to give
1542
you like mission critical stuff right
1543
away
1544
especially when you're younger you know
1546
you're not going to show up first day
1548
and they're going to say write me a
1549
proposal on on if ibm should buy red hat
1551
which they already did but you know what
1553
i mean
1554
um don't worry when you show up you go
1556
through a training program or you'll
1557
you'll get mentors whatever or you'll
1559
photocopy like i did uh which i did with
1562
pleasure because i read all the stuff
1563
when i was photocopying when i worked at
1565
accenture i learned
1567
meet people have fun and learn
1571
all right next up we've got the
1573
importance of sincere gratitude
1576
and so this is a a great book here by
1578
the dalai lama called the art of
1580
happiness which i i read on my honeymoon
1582
actually um and i read this actually we
1584
were in um we were in bali and i bought
1586
the book and i read it there such a
1587
beautiful place to read that book too i
1589
loved it and the indonesian people were
1591
so nice oh my god they're incredible
1593
but read this book if you get a chance
1597
because it will really help you
1598
understand the importance of of of
1601
gratitude you know be grateful for
1603
something different every day
1605
and with my kids um when i put them into

1616
other two kids i do
1617
uh and um during prayers i i asked them
1621
to thank god every night for something
1624

1625
uh and so the
1626
we've knew it for years it's i mean it's
1628
getting crazy now they're like thank you
1630

1632
i mean if you're grateful for something
1633
different see if we're still recording
1634
okay good if you're grateful for
1636
something different every single day uh
1638
it'll get you into peak mental states
1641
and so i practice gratitude
1643
every day before i get up you know i say
1645
prayer and i thank god for ten things in
1648
this order always
1650
andrew matthew dylan christine mom dad
1652
jamie k elizabeth and my students you
1655

1658
andrew matthew dylan are my kids

1691
yeah and so your kids your spouse
1693
whatever your buddies that sort of thing
1696
be grateful for what you have and
1698
don't buy things
1699
by experiences
1703
okay next up your alma maters okay where
1707
you went to school the network matters a
1710
lot and so keep in contact it's a
1712
wonderful thing
1714
because a lot of times you'll learn more
1716
from your fellow classmates than you
1718
will from your teacher it's true it's
1721
true
1722
so one of the best networks you can have
1724
is a school network
1726
and you don't have to go to harvard
1727
business school for that
1728
any network really any network so your
1732
alma maters just remember that
1735
okay
1736
uh next up is a crucial post meeting
1740
networking best practice
1742
so it's really simple after every single
1745
meeting you have in business for the
1747
rest of your life
1749
that day
1750
i want you to connect with that person
1752
or the people you met that day using
1754
linkedin
1755
please do it please do it um because
1758
your your net worth is your your network
1760
so to speak uh and when people size you
1763
up uh and they look at at who you are
1766
and which contacts you have in common if
1768
you have a lot of secondary connections
1770
with somebody meaning uh contacts in
1773
common or whatever it is
1774
um
1775
then
1776
they're they're more likely gonna take
1778
you a little bit more seriously yeah
1780
it costs you nothing too it costs you
1782
nothing
1784
all right um and then um
1787
i think that's it yeah we're done now
1789
with uh with section number one which is
1791
relationships are more important
1793

in a cyber truck elon musk cyber truck
2111
it's tough to see i i screwed up the the
2113
graphic there let me go back here
2115
but i included it for for a reason in
2117
the 3d model
2119
and i did it because uh elon musk
2122
is so long-term focused
2125
um that he ignored all the naysayers
2127
when it comes to you know creating
2129
battery operated cars
2131
um he he ignored the naysayers that that
2133
tell him that he shouldn't try to get
2135
into the industrial
2136
car market as well meaning trucks
2139
he ignores the naysayers by thinking
2141
about
2142
colonizing mars
2145
out there i know
2147
but he's very long-term focused and
2149
that's one of the many reasons why he's
2151
extraordinarily successful
2154
all right let's talk about the first
2155
lesson here
2156
the longer the view the wiser the
2158
intention

graphic of uh lombard street which is
2164
here in san francisco now it's a very
2167
long and winding road
2168
yeah so um you got to be very very
2171
long-term focused and warren buffett
2173
said the longer the view the wisely
2174
intention i completely believe in it
2176

reality be long-term focused

and i completely believe it and let me
2370
tell you a little bit more about david
2371
because i think we all do deserve a
2373
second chance
2374
um so
2376
david's brother is is on death row for
2378
um
2379
for yeah i'm not gonna go there but you
2382
can probably guess why
2383
and so uh david um he grew up um in east
2387
palo alto
2389
and east palo alto in america like in
2391
america you get really rich area and
2394
then kind of a scary neighborhood pretty
2396
quickly it's just it's just it's a land
2399
of extremes sometimes as much as i love
2401
this country
2402
but in east palo alto the high school
2405
graduation rate is only 40
2408
percent and there's there's a lot of
2411
deadbeat fathers i don't think there's
2413
such thing as a debbie mother
2416
uh and so um david actually got a
2418
scholarship uh to go to
2421
a great school called juniperocera it's
2423
a private all-boys school
2425
and i was gonna send my kids there as
2427
well um
2429
and i went to an event there a charity
2430
event and he gave a great speech
2432
that inspired me and changed my life
2434
in in that school there's a lot of
2437
athletes there too like
2439
greg jeffrey's great baseball player
2440
went there so did barry bonds and
2443
the best quarterback in history i can't
2445
remember his name right now but you guys
2446
all know his name
2448
um
2450
yeah he's dating gisele i think anyway
2453
tom brady i think yeah but um
2456
when i saw david give a speech there and
2458
by the way i decided not to send my kids
2459
to that school um i they all go to
2461
public school
2463
which is the
2464
it's i think it's better than prep i
2466
won't go there if you won't ask why i'll
2467
i'm happy to go there too but but in
2469
that that that uh that event uh david
2471
was keynote speech speaker
2473
um and he said something it changed my
2475
life
2477
um
2478
and he grew up in in east palo alto and
2480
got a scholarship to go to that school
2481
but he said
2483
don't expect
2485
to accomplish your dreams in life
2488
unless you help others accomplish theirs
2490
first
2492
let me say that again
2494
don't expect to accomplish your dreams
2496
in life
2498
unless you help others accomplish theirs
2500
first
2501
i believe in that i really do
2504
and and david has turned his life around
2506
as well he actually spent time in jail
2507
as well for robbing a safeway uh grocery
2510
store here when he was a he was a kid
2512
everybody deserves a second chance and
2514
so what we do in the limo foundation
2516
and i've donated a lot of money for
2518
scholarships there etc i'll continue to
2520
do so
2521
is um what we do is the people that work
2524
at limo
2526
they'll they'll pick up these these kids
2528
from
2529
really poor areas uh in the morning
2532
they'll give them full scholarships to
2534
the best private schools
2536
the best private schools
2538
they'll drive them to school
2540
then after school is done so they don't
2542
get into trouble doing bad stuff or
2544
whatever it is
2546
after school is done they'll bring them
2547
back to limo headquarters
2549
which is close to east palo alto
2551
and um
2553
they have a sports facility as you saw
2554
in that video and a lot of computers as
2556
well
2557
and then what they'll do is they'll help
2559
the students with their homework if they
2560
need help then they'll drive them back
2562
home by seven or eight o'clock at night
2564
and they do this every day every weekday
2566
and it's a wonderful thing
2569
because
2570
you're giving a chance to to all these
2572
underprivileged kids from tough
2575
backgrounds and i love them to death
2577
you know i i love them so much more
2579
because they come from a tough
2580
background
2581
and there's potential everybody i got to
2583
show you
2584
going off script again but whatever
2586
so i want to show you um these kids
2588
they're amazing and the reason i i
2589
created my course an entire mba one
2591
course
2592
was because of lima
2595
so so what i did was if i go to my home
2597
page
2599
if i scroll down the bottom here
2601
charity yeah it's here i think yeah
2603
so yeah these are the cherries i'm ball
2605
with so here's limo foundation
2608
and
2609
this is this is them they're amazing
2611
they're incredible but there's also
2613
pictures here i want to show you as well
2616
so right here
2618
this here is a it'll scroll through in a
2620
second here
2621
so this here is a picture of one of the
2624
amazing limo students
2626
uh and this is me in
2628
january of 2016 a day that changed my
2630
life
2632
um and and what happened was i i told
2635
david i said david
2637
why don't we
2638
why don't you let me teach all the limo
2640
students on a saturday
2642
and and i'll call it um an entire nba
2645
one one day
2646
and i hand made all these degrees for
2649
them and that was at the end of that one
2651
day and i gave my book as well now these
2653
these kids are great uh and i want to
2655
show you this actually this is this is
2656
what i want to show you
2659
the kids that were there that day
2661
they ranged from the ages of of um
2664
of nine
2666
uh to 17.
2667
and we spent 12 hours there and this was
2669
actually in longitude capitals venture
2671
capital headquarters in menlo park
2673
it was uh
2675
patrick one of one of the guys on the
2676
board let us use his office good dude
2679
uh and actually lilika right here um she
2682
graduated she she's i think she was at
2684
the san francisco art institute after
2686
she finished high school and she's on my
2688
board as well i'm proud to say and this
2690
dude here is nine
2692
and the oldest here was 17 at the time
2695
and the whole day when i was teaching
2696
them and the course is only eight hours
2698
on udemy but the version here i made it
2700
12 hours a bit longer
2702
and the whole day when i was teaching
2704
them this
2705
every one of these kids including this
2707
dude here who's nine
2709
their eyes were wide open all day like
2711
they weren't blinking they were just oh
2712
my god like somebody's paying attention
2714
to me this is awesome their questions
2715
were brilliant
2717
and what fires me up is getting people
2720
that have been given a crappy set of
2722
cards in life and helping them achieve
2724
their dreams that fires me up that makes
2726
me more happy than me accomplishing my
2728
own dreams and there's potential in
2730
everybody which is why i do what i do
2733
and
2734
all these kids have gone on to do
2735
wonderful things wonderful things so far
2739
and you know again this was back in 2016
2741
in january
2742
and i created these degrees for all of
2744
them um yeah i went to an art shop and i
2747
bought stickers it was fun and then what
2750
happened was this that was on a saturday
2753
then on i think it was a sunday i put my
2755
course online on on udemy my mba course
2759
and i think it might have been by a
2760
monday or so that business insider wrote
2762
an article that got shared hundreds of
2764
thousands of times and it took off it
2766
took off
2767
uh and it changed my life
2769
and
2771
everything i do
2772
like like teaching all of you
2774
the genesis
2776
is that day which changed my life right
2778
there
2780
don't expect to accomplish your dreams
2781
until you help others accomplish theirs
2783
first i really believe in that
2786
and so david said learn earn return just
2790
remember that make that the cornerstone
2792
of your life as well and your philosophy
2795
learn
2796
earn return it's simplistic
2799
and throughout your life like don't wait
2800
until you're worth a fortune to return
2803
you know
2804
give give time as well
2806
and i went to a columbia business school
2809
and i remember it was a henry kravis
2811
henry kravis is the number one private
2813
equity dude in history and um
2818
i'll show you i'll show you what it
2818
looks like here
2820
so he actually uh henry kravis uh
2823
there's more pictures of the students
2825
there
2826
so henry kravis kind of created the
2828
private equity market we kind of talked
2830
about him a bit when we were doing that
2831
that
2832
that case study with all the hats with
2834
disney a while back
2836
uh but um henry kravis
2839
he went to columbia and he was a
2840
straight c student grades don't matter
2842
that's right
2843
uh and what he did was he actually um
2846
he came to school and i was really
2848
excited because i thought that
2851
henry kravis was going to talk about
2853
deals
2854
and i read a great book when i was a kid
2856
called barbarians at the gate which
2858
talks about how henry kravis and others
2861
bought uh
2862
nabisco which stands for the national
2865
biscuit company took it private made a
2866
fortune
2867
and so he showed up at columbia one day
2869
to lecture and and instead of warren
2872
buffett one day too which is cool that
2873
he's also an alum there
2876
and i couldn't wait to learn about deals
2879
and
2881
he talked for an hour and a half
2883
all he talked about was just
2886
not giving money but giving your time of
2888
course he donates money too
2889
but giving your time
2891
uh and and i gained a tremendous amount
2894
of respect for him and he's totally
2895
right he's totally right you gotta
2898
you got to donate your time and do
2901
charity work throughout your entire
2902
career okay you really really do um and
2906
if you give you will get
2908
it's prophetic it's true it's been true
2910
since being a time
2911
you know give and you will receive
2914
so just remember that
2916
learn
2917
earn return
2919
and to quote david for the limo
2920
foundation before we move on to lesson
2922
11.
2924
don't expect to accomplish your goals or
2926
dreams in life
2927
until you help others accomplish theirs
2929
first
2932
all right next up is number 11 the
2935
harder you work the luckier you get
2938
all right and that's of course a
2939
four-leaf clover
2941
it's true though like you will get a
2943
break
2944
you will get a break
2946
um you know
2947
if you're working your ass off and
2949
nothing is working out for you in your
2951
life
2952
nothing
2953
just keep at it
2955
keep at it you will get a break
2957
eventually
2958
you know like michael jordan said i
2959
failed over and over and over again and
2961
that's why i succeed
2962
you will get your lucky break i promise
2965
you
2966
you will one day and you look back and
2969
you'll be grateful to god
2971
that
2972
you had these potential failures or
2974
career setbacks early on because it
2976
actually guided you down a different
2978
path in life you might not understand
2980
that now
2981
but i promise you will one day i promise
2983
you
2984
you know years ago i was down and out
2986
i did everything right i worked for
2988
somebody i made him a fortune
2990
um he took all the credits
2992
and people loved me on the team
2994
and i was probably too good at my job
2996
and so yeah you know what he did to me
3000
and i remember calling my dad i said dad
3001
i don't get it like i work so hard
3004
you know and and i try to be a good
3006
person
3007
i try to give back and mentor and do
3009
what i can do and i made the company so
3011
much money and this shark
3014
you know this this awful person who i'll
3016
never name it's just i'll turn the other
3018
cheek i guess
3020
but i i told my dad about it and he's
3022
like chris you won't understand this one
3024
day but you'll look back years from now
3027
and and you'll be grateful uh that it
3030
happened because somehow it set you down
3032
a different path
3033
i said dad that doesn't make any sense
3035
um
3036
and i said it respectfully obviously i'm
3038
very respectful of my parents
3040
and then my dad he said chris what i
3042
want you to do is go to the old
3043
testament
3045
the old testament is kind of the basis
3046
for many great religions whatever
3049
and he said i want you to read the book
3050
of job
3052
which is prophetic because jay would be
3054
his job it's about this guy that lost
3057
everything
3058
and he didn't
3059
lose his faith
3061
and then much much later years later
3064
everything worked out for him and he
3065
kind of understood why things were the
3067
way they were so
3069
the harder you work the luckier you get
3071
you will get that lucky break okay just
3073
remember to keep failing over and over
3075
and over again and not giving a damn
3076
what anybody thinks
3078
and i promise you i promise you i
3080
guarantee it
3082
you will get your lucky break
3084
the harder you work the luckier you get
3089
all right next up is the most important
3091
investment you will ever make
3093
the most important investment you'll
3094
ever make is investment in you
3097
don't ever be cheap when it comes to
3099
education
3101
so if if there's a book you want to
3103
download or read and you're like i don't
3104
know man it's like it's like 10 bucks i
3106
don't know if i should
3108
don't be cheap
3110
just do it
3112
you know subscribe to audible.com it's
3113
like 10 or 15 bucks a month you can
3115
listen to two books every month from i
3118
don't know whoever your
3120
whoever your inspirations are listen to
3122
biographies or autobiographies on
3124
successful people they share their
3126
blueprint with you they give give give
3128
give gift
3129
you know they put they let their cards
3131
be seen by everybody because they've
3132
already made it and a lot of people that
3134
are very very successful
3136
the reason they were successful or
3138
became successful is because they gave
3140
remember in the first couple classes we
3142
talked about that book give and take
3144
and how the richest 1 people in the
3147
world
3148
you know are our givers
3150
the middle 98 percenter takers
3152
and the poorest one percent of my
3153
favorite uh the mother teresa's of the
3155
world that were
3157
never concerned about making money
3158
whatever yeah
3160
it's so funny though because
3162
it's coming full circle now but mother
3164
teresa
3165
there's this guy
3166
that went to that school sarah that
3169
david from the limo foundation went to
3171
and so the first year i went to that
3173
that charity event at limo or a party at
3175
sarah and i saw dave give that speech
3178
where he said don't expect to accomplish
3180
your goals or dreams until you help
3182
others accomplish theirs first
3183
the second year i went back as well as
3185
another charity event and i donated
3186
again i didn't send my kids to private
3187
school because i think public school is
3189
better better
3191
but the second year when i was there the
3193
guy that gave the keynotes
3195
and it was a tough act to follow because
3196
david's amazing
3198
the guy that gave the keynote was a guy
3199
that went to sarah as well who was um
3203
who was mother teresa's photographer
3206
so um and and he showed us some
3208
wonderful pictures i got to show you
3210
something give me i'm going off script i
3211
i don't give a damn um i'm gonna
3214
stand up here in my my lululemon sweats
3217
uh and walk around and find something to
3219
show you
3222
i almost fell down there but i'm okay
3226
all right um
3231
here it is
3233
see if it's in the picture i think it is
3235
um mother teresa said peace begins with
3238
a smile
3240
i love that it's so true
3243
it's so true
3244
peace does begin with a smile i i love
3246
her to death lover did that somebody's
3248
got to make a great movie about her
3249
she's
3250
probably my probably one of my favorite
3252
people that ever ever walked this great
3254
earth i'm so humbled to say i walked
3255
this earth at the same time she did i
3257
never got to meet her yeah but but she's
3259
wonderful she's wonderful and i'll put
3261
this up here actually
3263
yeah actually i'll put it right here so
3265
you can see both quotes
3267
okay
3269
all right
3271
and this here by the way if you're
3272
curious is how um we can tell if the the
3275
color is correct when we go into post
3278
edit so i have it face every single
3280
camera
3281
just to make sure that the color matches
3283
because when i change the colors behind
3284
me it messes up the pigment of my skin
3286
sometimes yeah yeah yeah
3289
all right
3290
because in some videos i look like ernie
3294
or bert
3296
all right
3299
all right next next up is um
3303
yeah oh oh yes so in terms of the most
3304
important investment you'll ever make
3306
it's an investment in you um education
3309
always always always don't ever be cheap
3311
when it comes to education if your dream
3313
was to go to i don't know yale medical
3316
school
3317
um and you know yeah
3320
you're worried about the money
3322
don't be just get in first and then
3323
figure it out you'll figure it out
3325
i actually
3327
there's this one guy i was friends with
3328
growing up and his mom used to always
3330
brag about him yeah and and his name was
3333
uh was was rick
3335
uh and
3336
he got into yale and his mom was
3338
bragging
3339
saying uh you know you know my son
3343
he got into jail
3347
so if your goal is to go to jail or or
3348
yale
3349
uh then um but but the money's an issue
3352
just get in first and you you get a
3354
scholarship you'll figure it out
3355
if you want something bad enough in life
3356
you'll always figure it out always
3358
figure it out but when it comes to
3359
smaller things
3360
in life like you know buying a book for
3362
education if you're on the fence just
3364
buy it dude
3366
just do it just do it don't be cheap
3367
when it comes to
3369
investing in yourself it's the best
3370
investment you'll ever make in yourself
3373
all right next up we've got uh learn
3376
what not to do
3378
um and i had so much fun creating these
3380
graphics here
3381
uh and and i was that guy that
3384
didn't watch game of thrones for years
3386
because i tried and then my kids were
3388
around so i'd have to turn it off and i
3390
try again later and there's eight
3391
million different characters and i just
3392
couldn't keep up there's too many
3394
characters man it's complicated eh
3397
uh and so uh i included that the bad
3399
dude there um
3402
something walker ice walker or something
3404
yeah bad guy and i show him because i i
3408
worked
3409
for people
3410
that
3411
should not be managing people they're
3413
they're awful awful people to work for
3417
and i did learn from them because i
3418
learned
3419
what not to do
3422
and so my attitude could have been
3423
negative forever
3424
but i told myself you know what
3427
two things number one i'm learning how
3429
not to treat people
3431
and number two
3432
this guy's such a jerk
3434
that he's actually helping me because
3436
he's motivating me
3438
to you know
3439
work hard on getting a better job and
3441
improve myself so i'm never complacent
3444
so when you work for other people learn
3447
what not to do
3448
as much as possible as much as possible
3451
all right i think i'm going to take that
3452
down because i'm not sure about the
3453
glare i think it's fine but it might
3455
mess things up here but just remember
3457
peace begins with it with a smile yeah
3459
and i've got this great quote here which
3461
which i used to use in a lot of my
3463
keynotes
3465
um
3466
and it's from a great poet american poet
3469
um
3470
a real renaissance man actually
3472
um and he lived here in san francisco
3474
for a while his name is mark twain uh
3476
and a lot of people don't realize that
3478
san francisco although it's california
3480
is not warm
3482
you know it's cold especially in the
3483
summer the warm season's the fall
3485
and so mark twain once said the coldest
3488
winter i ever spent was a summer in san
3492
francisco
3493
but mark twain also said
3496
the two most important days in your life
3498
are number one the day you're born
3502
and number two the day you find out why
3505
and hopefully through the soul-searching
3507
process of this entire mba degree
3510
including today's class next class on
3512
101 crucial lessons my book hopefully
3514
that will help you to find your why
3519
okay
3520
all right so learn not what not to do
3522
when you work for schmucks there is
3524
light at the end of the tunnel and it is
3526
not an oncoming train
3528
all right so we are now done uh with uh
3531

section three avoiding burnouts
3749
i wrote here at the top avoid these
3751
crucial landmines and save your career
3754
and your life and it's killing me that
3756
there's no end of quote there or the end
3758
of bracket at the end there but that's
3759
good enough i'm going to leave it here
3761
because i want to prove a point that
3763
you'll never accomplish anything in life
3765
if you try to be a perfectionist okay if
3768
if you want to
3769
don't be a perfectionist if you want to
3770
vlog or blog or create some sort of
3773
youtube video
3774
and what's holding you back is you don't
3775
publish it because it's not perfect and
3777
you care what people are going to think
3778
screw it just do it as sir richard
3781
branson says screw it let's do it so i'm
3783
going to leave that that parenthesis oh
3784
my god i talk a lot i'm going to leave
3786
that parenthesis or close bracket out of
3787
it there so avoid burnout is section 3.
3790
and it is getting hot in here
3792
speaking of matches
3794
all right so uh lesson 14 is what to do
3797
the second you return from vacation
3800
and i worked when i was at goldman years
3802
ago one of my clients uh rhonda chang
3805
just a brilliant woman that worked at
3807
manulife which is a big insurance
3808
company that's canadian most people
3810
don't realize that
3811
and i was kind of stressed out and she
3813
said chris let me give you some advice
3815
and of course i didn't take her advice
3817
but i listened to it
3819
her advice was this the second you come
3822
back from vacation
3824
what i want you to do is i want you to
3826
open up your calendar
3828
and
3829
book your next vacation six months out
3831
that's the first thing you should do
3833
when you come back from vacation open
3834
your calendar and book your next
3836
vacation six months out otherwise you
3838
will burn out you will burn out yeah so
3841
it's um
3843
and it's i i gotta keep remembering this
3845
too so the second you return from
3847
vacation i want you to book your next
3849
vacation
3851
all right next up is uh stress will kill
3854
you don't be the gazelle
3856
i was watching national geographic years
3858
ago
3859
and it was this poor gazelle being
3861
chased uh by by by a a i think it was a
3865
cheetah or a tiger i can't remember
3868
and
3869
the gazelle was not caught thank
3870
goodness
3871
but national geographic put sensors on
3874
the gazelle to monitor the gazelles
3876
heart rates and other bodily functions
3879
and what happened was this
3881
the gazelle was running for their for
3883
the for its life
3884
and so obviously the heart was pumping
3886
really fast you know pumping quickly
3887
getting as much blood as possible you
3889
know circling around the body
3892
and what happened was the heart and the
3894
mind
3895
focused entirely on survival
3898
and as a result
3900
the heart and the mind i guess somehow
3903
shut down the immune system while the
3905
the gazelle was running
3907
running for its life and the heart and
3909
the mind
3910
also shut down the reproductive system
3914
and the gazelle aged a bit when it was
3917
being chased as well
3919
so the reproduction of functions shut
3921
down
3922
it aged faster
3924
and also it could get sick quicker
3926
because
3928
all the heart and mind was focused on
3929
was pumping more blood
3931
and surviving that's stress stress can
3934
kill you and so the only reason we're
3937
supposed to feel stressed like that in
3939
our lives
3941
is if you know going back to caveman
3943
times or whatever you're being chased by
3945
a dinosaur or whatever it is somebody
3948
that wants to take your life that's when
3950
you feel stress
3952
not all the time at work
3954
a lot of times stress is up here
3958
you know i i
3959
i feel stressed probably because i'm
3961
making myself stressed so don't be the
3963
gazelle just chill out man
3967
and what happens is conceiving having a
3969
baby is not it's not as easy as most
3972
people think
3973
um that that haven't had kids before
3975
you know we're we're very blessed that
3977
you know christine and i got pregnant
3978
pretty quickly with with all three three
3980
boys we wanted to have a daughter as
3982
well and usually people that have two
3984
kids have a girl and a boy and they're
3985
done
3986
um but anyway i love all three of my
3989
boys the same um but if we had a
3991
daughter be it'd be it'd be awesome too
3993
it'd be awesome too
3994
wholly off topic but a lot of people
3997
when they're trying to conceive trying
3998
to have a child it's so stressful
4001
and i remember for christine and i too
4002
the first time we want to have a kid
4005
there was a pregnancy test she bought it
4007
and the second i we found out she wasn't
4010
i was like damn it it was stressful
4013
you know because it's why are we here
4015
you know it says it's
4017
kids that's one of the reasons the why
4019
right but and then eventually obviously
4021
things worked out great for us
4022
but we have friends that have tried
4024
everything in vitro spending a gazillion
4027
dollars whatever trying to have kids and
4029
it's so stressful in their marriage and
4031
then they they conclude that
4033
maybe we just can't get pregnant
4036
and they do something wonderful they
4038
adopt
4040
adoption's a beautiful thing
4042
and then what happens is after they
4044
adopt this happens a lot
4046
a couple months later they get pregnant
4049
naturally
4050
because they weren't feeling stress
4052
don't be the gazelle please
4055
don't be the gazelle just
4057
just chill out it's all up here a lot of
4060
the stress you're doing it to yourself
4062
you're doing it to yourself
4064
it's all up here perception becomes
4066
reality
4068
so just condition yourself
4071
not to be stressed
4073
and maybe what you do every day is
4075
let me go back here
4078
every day on on your daily sheet here
4081
you do what i do which is when i wake up
4083
in the morning
4084
the first thing i do is um well i say
4086
prayer but i also thank god for 10
4088
different things
4090
maybe what you do is part of your your
4092
daily sheet here you you can change this
4095
if you want to and at the end of today's
4097
lecture i'm going to remind you where to
4099
go get this and how to change this in
4100
powerpoint or other programs but you can
4103
change it so that this is your gratitude
4104
section here so you write down what your
4107
gratitude about or get rid of that
4109
section and have a gratitude section
4110
whatever it is along with writing your
4112
goals and your schedule for the next day
4113
as well okay
4116
don't be the gazelle please
4120
all right
4122
avoid burnout avoid burnout yeah
4125
all right next up we have got um when to
4128
take a day off when you are not sick
4130
this is important dude so
4133
are you ever kind of in a bad mooc
4135
because you're kind of i don't know
4135
you're kind of stressed at work and
4138
you didn't get enough sleep whatever and
4140
things aren't going that great at home
4142
temporarily
4143
and so
4145
you're not feeling great mentally
4146
physically you're fine
4148
but you go to work
4150
and you go to work and
4152
you might
4154
not be as nice as always
4158
put it mildly
4159
or you might be a little bit cold to
4161
somebody at work
4163
or you might be
4165
you're supposed to give a presentation
4166
and
4168
a lot of important people are around and
4169
you just
4170
stressed out
4172
man you should never have shown up to
4175
work that day to begin with
4178
and so i think it's important to take at
4180
least one or two days off a year
4183
when physically you're not sick
4185
but mentally you're not all there
4190
it's important
4192
and
4193
you can tell people you're sick because
4194
you are
4195
you know
4196
you're mentally kind of just feeling
4197
burned out
4199
it's a great investment to make yourself
4201
and i made this red the bottle here red
4203
on purpose uh supposed to be pills
4206
um
4207
it looks like it's clothing red on the
4209
outside i put the wrong thing on it
4210
whatever but but it on purpose to make a
4212
point just it's a sense of urgency when
4215
you're mentally drained
4217
do not
4219
whatever you do do not go to work that
4221
day
4222
whatever you do is going to hurt you
4224
more than help you
4227
all rights
4228
lord oh this is the ten commandments
4230
these laws
4232
unto thy people
4234
hear me
4235
oh hear me
4237
all pay heed
4239
the lord the lord jehovah has given unto
4243
you these fifteen
4246
like
4248
ten ten commandments for all to obey
4255
i love that that was one of the first
4256
movies i ever saw uh when i was a kid it
4258
was called history of the world part one
4260
uh by mel brooks and my dad took me the
4263
movie i don't think he realized it was
4264
gonna be
4266
some parts weren't supposed to be
4267
supposed to be shown to kids but that
4268
was before uh indiana jones in the
4270
temple of doom came out in 82 or 83
4273
because that movie indiana jones off
4275
script whatever
4276
indiana jones in the temple of doom that
4278
was the
4280
that was the first movie that was um
4282
uh that that that should not have been
4285
pg it should have been a a which they
4287
got rid of and so because of temple of
4289
doom they created something called pg-13
4292
which is another category of of of
4294
raiding movies but that was uh that was
4296
uh mel brooks obviously very very funny
4298
man um and so i i
4301
i bring up the ten commandments it's not
4303
a religious thing here but um you know
4305
those ten rules are the basis for a lot
4307
of laws in in many wonderful countries
4310
and the basis for a lot of religions too
4312
but
4313
when those 10 rules were made thousands
4315
of years ago
4317
one they they knew our four mothers and
4319
forefathers that we need to take time
4322
off or we'll burn out it's human nature
4324
which hasn't changed in thousands of
4326
years and you know
4329
the rule is to
4331
rest on the sunday or saturday or
4333
whatever it is just one day a week
4335
one day a week
4337
you got to take off that one day a week
4339
at least
4341
and spend time with your family uh and
4344
you know just get
4345
just just focus on getting yourself
4347
centered so to speak get outside your
4348
body and kind of take a look uh
4351
see the forest from the trees
4353
um where are you in your life and what
4355
are you here for anyway and you know
4357
what what what's your why what's your
4359
long-term goals are you happy at work in
4361
your relationships whatever
4363
um are you bonding enough with your kids
4365
because by the time your kids are 13
4367
years old you've already are 12 years
4369
old
4370
you've already spent 90 of the time
4372
you'll ever spend with them so just
4374
that's precious man like screw work
4377
if you can every now and then you know
4379
just
4380
skip work to go to mommy or daddy daddy
4384
child breakfast day at school because i
4387
missed andrews years ago
4389
and i don't know why i must have had an
4391
important meeting that was so important
4392
i can't remember it today but i do
4394
remember missing andrew daddy day at
4396
breakfast at school um so anyway
4400
you can't get that time back and take as
4401
many pictures as you can too before your
4403
kids get old just savor every second
4405
because they go fast man
4407
and
4408
my third son dylan my youngest son he
4411
said dad
4412
why is it
4414
there's not as many pictures of me as
4416
there are from my older brothers andrew
4418
matthew
4419
and i said of course there's enough it's
4421
the same and he counted them too right
4423
smart kid
4425
so i went to bed that night and i woke
4427
up
4428
and i looked at my night table
4431
and
4432
there are actually a couple pictures of
4434
him and me put in frames he went and he
4437
found them
4438
and they're still there now and this was
4439
years ago years ago yeah you you can't
4441
get that time back
4443
uh so just remember that uh
4445
you will burn out
4446
if you don't take time off
4448
uh it doesn't matter what what religion
4450
you are and who cares it's you gotta
4452
take one day off a week at least or you
4454

let's move on to topic number four
4801
so topic number four is called create
4804
off the charts confidence wear that
4806
superman cape
4808
uh and at the top there it says
4810
crucial confidence lessons to help your
4813
career take off i love this section i
4815
love this section because
4817
confidence is entirely up here it's a
4820
light switch just flick it on just flick
4823
it on okay
4825
all right
4826
so
4827
the first lesson that we're going to
4828
talk about here
4830
in section number four is that
4833
there are no limits
4835
there are no limits and that's a ford
4837
mustang down there because
4839
henry ford said
4841
um whether or not you think you can do
4843
it
4844
you are right let me say that again
4847
whether or not you think you can do it
4850
you are right
4852
it's all up here i know it sounds so
4855
simplistic
4856
so simplistic
4858
but confidence is merely a light switch
4862
so just remember the past does not equal
4864
the future
4866
so
4867
if something brings you down confidence
4869
wise it never happened
4872
erase it from your mind or at least
4873
don't think about it at all
4875
whether or not you think you can do it
4877
you're right it's all up here there are
4879
no limits except the limits that we set
4882
for ourselves
4884
okay number 19 is the glass is
4887
always full always full and for those
4890
you're not familiar with that term
4892
there's a saying that
4893
if somebody sees a glass that's that has
4896
water up to the halfway mark
4897
negative people will say the glasses
4899
have empty and positive people will say
4901
no the glass is half full
4903
so perception becomes reality you know
4905
it's like the rodan sculpture i think
4907
therefore i am
4909
and so this glass here um is not
4912
half full
4913
it's it's overflowing in my mind
4917
and people think that i'm naively
4919
positive
4920
but i think the most positive people in
4921
the world are the only ones that can
4923
change the world okay i think all of you
4925
if you're very positive you can put your
4928
dent in the universe and change the
4929
world as well so i got to be careful
4931
because this thing is really overflowing
4933
whoa
4935
all right the glass is not half half
4937
full it's overflowing my cup overfloweth
4941
with optimism
4944
all right next up we have got um a
4946
balanced life means a more it means
4949
you're more productive
4950
in business
4952
um
4953
and we talked about this before so i
4954
don't go into much
4955
too much detail on that but
4957
you know there's there are many people
4959
in life that are incredibly well-rounded
4961
you know they they're in great shape
4962
they have a great family life
4964
um you know they've got a great social
4967
life they do well at work
4969
uh they're happy because they're
4970
balanced because they're balanced um and
4973
so if you're balanced and if you take
4976
your breaks as well i mean take that one
4977
day off per week uh then you'll be much
4980
more successful as well let me go i want
4982
to go back and i'm really curious to see
4984
if uh
4986
b h is open right now and and i have to
4989
bring this up because i mean this
4990
inspires me dude so b and h again they
4992
take that one day off a week
4995
let's see here
4996
um since 1973 it looks like no there's
4999
they're still they're still open but i
5000
will come back to this in a little while
5003
uh let's go begin checkout i'm not going
5004

5007

5025

5027
but if you're balanced in life you'll be
5028
much more productive and don't forget to
5030
fill out that daily schedule as well
5034
because that will help you be much more
5035
balanced
5036
all right let's move on number 21
5039
there's luigi that's from luigi's
5040
mansion okay um number twenty it's great
5043
having kids because you get to be a kid
5045
all over again yeah
5046
um so number 21 is you're never as
5049
nervous uh as you sound
5051
um you know although you might not think
5054
you're confident and you might think you
5056
don't look confident when you're up
5057
there on the stage in front of the world
5060
when you feel nervous you don't look or
5062
sound nervous don't worry about it don't
5065
worry about it and who gives a when
5067
anybody thinks you anyway
5069
i don't care that's what you got to tell
5071
yourself
5073
okay luigi
5076
all right next up uh we've got avoid
5078
those people okay and i had to have
5081
another video game
5082
uh reference here not just nintendo but
5085
this here is for i guess ps4 and an xbox
5088
uh that's a character who i'm
5090
embarrassed to say is canadian in the
5091
game his name is trevor he's a bad bad
5094
person
5096
and he is from grand theft auto 5.
5100
and i'm smiling because in one scene he
5102
has a canadian accent as he takes on the
5103
u.s military it's a little bit funny but
5106
he's a bad dude
5108
and you got to avoid those people
5111
and when i say those people i mean
5112
anybody that that hurts your confidence
5115
or brings you down
5117
you know you're you're
5118
you're not a tree you can move
5120
move away from these people cut them out
5122
of your life that's right
5124
that's right get them out of your life
5127
you know if you've got a little bird on
5128
your shoulder
5129
um or a devil or whatever it is saying
5132
you're not good enough you're not good
5133
enough you're not good enough
5136
get rid of that person get it out of
5137
your life
5138
get that person out of your life so
5141
avoid those people
5143
and go with your gut your gut is always
5145
right you know when you're a lot younger
5148
like i was it was you know 10 strikes
5150
you're out now it's one strike you're
5152
out or maybe two sometimes
5155
but just avoid anybody in your life that
5156
makes you unhappy
5158
get them out of your life
5160
you know get them out of your mind
5163
they don't own you they can't control
5164
you
5166
get rid of them that's right
5168
change your environment you'll change
5170
your life as well somebody brings you
5171
down just get rid of them man get rid of
5174
them so anyway
5176
see you trevor
5179
all right
5181
all right this
5182
number 23 is that person speaks gooder
5186
than me and he's supposed to have
5187
glasses there i think i cut them off and
5188
i was trying to get rid of the
5189
transparent background there yeah
5192
so
5192
don't ever get intimidated
5195
by people that
5197
you think might have a better vocabulary
5199
than you
5200
or people that might have a different
5202
accent than you
5204
don't be intimidated by them
5207
because a lot of times the reason why
5209
they might be well spoken
5211
is because they're very arrogant
5214
or maybe they went to a great school
5216
because their parents went there and
5218
it's legacy that's how they got in
5221
just because somebody sounds
5224
confident or arrogant
5227
don't let the perception be that that
5229
fools you that they're right
5231
uh or more often
5233
right than you are
5234
you know confidence does not lead
5237
to uh to competence it might lead to
5240
perceived competence
5241
but not confidence in general so don't
5243
don't ever get intimidated by anybody
5245
that that speaks gooder than you at all
5248
has nothing to do with success in life
5251
it just bring you know it might have
5252
something to do with they were born with
5254
a silver spoon in their mouth
5256
and and i'd rather not hire somebody
5258
that was born with a silver spoon in
5259
their mouth
5260
because they're entitled i want somebody
5262
that's poor smart and hungry or somebody
5264
that's humble that's important to me so
5267
don't ever get intimidated by that and
5269
my dad actually he uh when he immigrated
5271
from from egypt uh to and i didn't know
5273
my dad had an accident until i was like
5275
20 or so or 19 or 18 when i moved out
5278
um he sounds a bit like james earl jones
5281
uh this is cnn or or simba's father or
5284
whatever
5285
um but but i remember my dad told me
5286
when he first moved to canada it was
5288
really frustrating because he had to
5290
support himself by by he immigrated in
5292
1967 he left egypt
5295
and he bribed an army official
5297
to get him to fail the eye exam for the
5300
crazy
5301
army or whatever was some stupid war in
5303
the middle east in 67.
5305
so my dad came to canada and in order to
5309
pay for himself here support himself
5311
before he met my mama
5313
um he uh he worked in a hospital
5315
cleaning test tubes and the nurses would
5317
all make fun of him uh because of his
5320
accent and he couldn't speak the
5321
language that well
5323
uh and uh
5324
you know he he could have just kind of
5327
given up
5328
uh or or just kind of accepted it and
5330
had it killed his confidence
5332
but uh
5334
he didn't he channeled that frustration
5336
uh and started his own company and so in
5338
hindsight i'm sure he's happy uh that uh
5341
that that happened yeah yeah so anyway
5345
and then he met my mama my mom is
5347
actually was a nurse or she isn't yeah
5348
she's still alive she she was a nurse
5351
and my dad's pickup line was uh
5353
jackie do you have a tylenol he asked my
5355
mom for tylenol my dad's a doctor yeah
5358
so anyway we love you dada
5361
so don't get intimidated by anybody with
5363
a different accent or someone speaks
5364
gooder than you because they're probably
5366
entitled dude and
5367
you peel back the onion a couple layers
5369
and they're nothing compared to you
5372
all right um and just remember number 24
5376
is
5376
nobody is smarter than you
5379
okay and
5381
in the book i i think i put a a link to
5384
um let's go here to number 24. it's
5387
lesson
5388
number 24.
5390
yeah here it is here
5392
yeah i have a link here to a a short
5394
video from steve jobs that will change
5396
your life it's like a minute or two long
5398
um
5399
how nobody is smarter than you and once
5402
you realize that i'm not telling you to
5403
be arrogant but once you realize that
5405
you're money you know i i believe you
5407
and i believe in you
5409
once you believe in yourself
5412
you'll never be the same you'll never be
5414
the same because you'll be able to
5415
accomplish anything you want to in life
5417
just remember that nobody is smarter
5419
than you okay
5421
just remember that confidence is
5423
everything dude it's everything
5426
everything
5427
like i remember when i grew up in canada
5432
and um i was kind of reserved a little
5434
shy canadian
5435
uh humble proud of my roots um and i
5438
remember it was it was the 80s
5441
and
5442
ronald reagan was my hero
5444
and i remember though that the
5447
the cover of newsweek and time magazine
5450
at the time was the downfall of the
5451
american student
5453
and how the american student is 50th in
5455
the world of math and 50th in the world
5457
in science it's a downfall of the
5458
american student
5460
and every couple of years you see the
5461
same stupid headlines americans are 25th
5464
or 50th in math whatever sciences
5466
it doesn't matter
5468
and i learned something when i started
5470
um
5473
when i started teaching here
5475
during the evenings years ago
5478
in the san francisco bay area and about
5481
50 percent of my students at least were
5483
born overseas okay so this is not an
5485
american thing what i'm about to say
5487
but yeah about 50 percent of my students
5489
and about 50 percent of people live here
5491
in the bay area and about 50 of the
5493
founders in the bay area and about 50
5494
percent of the engineers here in the bay
5496
area were born overseas you know people
5498
like pierre omidjar the wonderful
5500
humanitarian he's uh he's he's person
5502
he's from iran and of course he founded
5505
ebay you got elon musk who splits his
5507
time uh between here actually owns a
5509
house not too far away from me now here
5510
in hillsborough uh he splits his time
5512
between here in southern california but
5514
but elon musk
5516
who also lived in canada for years but
5519
but he's from south africa yeah you got
5521
um
5523
sergey brin and one of the brilliant
5525
co-founders of uh
5527
of google was born in russia
5530
um so you've got this this beautiful
5532
cross-cultural diversity here in the bay
5534
area but one thing i discovered when i
5536
started teaching here is that
5539
american students
5542
american students
5544
whether or not you're born in america
5545
doesn't matter but american students are
5547
number one in the world in the most
5549
important economic category
5551
that nobody talks about
5553
and that category is confidence
5556
you know with confidence comes the
5557
ability to sell
5559
sell a dream like like like like tucker
5561
does and there's the car version over
5563
here yeah
5564
um
5565
with confidence comes the ability to
5567
make something boring that's virtual
5570
that you can't see feel or touch like
5571
cloud software sound exciting think
5574
about it think how boring cloud software
5576
is
5577
dude it's boring you can't see it it's
5579
up there somewhere in the cloud it's
5580
elusive whatever
5582
but you've got these great entrepreneurs
5583
out there that sell it
5585
and they make a killing
5586
because they come across as confidence
5588
when they're delivering
5590
so confidence leads to
5593
at least
5594
to competent sometimes too not over
5596
being overconfident and of course
5598
i know that
5600
talking about the american angle some
5601
people overseas might think that's
5603
arrogance
5604
it's it's that's not what i'm getting at
5607
it's not like i've got to do a joke now
5608
here we go this is awful kids
5611
my american students are going to hate
5612
me but i'm american now so i'm allowed
5614
to do this
5615
how does an american screw in a light
5617
bulb oh my god i'm going to regret
5618
saying this i'm just one dumb comment
5620
away from just
5621
everybody hating me
5623
well here in america me as an american i
5625
hold a light bulb and the whole world
5627
spins around me
5629
okay i'm totally i'm totally kidding oh
5631
my god i've alienated my students i'm
5633
totally i love all of you okay i'm
5635
joking joking okay how does a a a dumb
5638
canadian me screwing a light bulb i hold
5640
it up there you go okay we're good now
5641
we're good
5642
but confidence uh it can be borderline
5645
arrogant sometimes you got to keep your
5646
confidence in check or just remember
5648
your humble roots and like steve jobs
5650
said you know stay foolish stay humble
5654
i i should i have to i should probably
5656
edit that out but f and i'm not going to
5658
sorry matt matt my editor he's american
5660
i love you matt you know i love you
5661
right your family familia
5663
yeah so um but no i i i do think a lot
5666
of american whether or not they were
5667
born in this country okay american
5669
students
5670
um see american students that were born
5672
overseas they also think they can hold a
5673
light bulb up okay
5675
but american students are number one
5677
in the world the most important economic
5678
category which is confidence which which
5680
lets you sell
5681
because a great entrepreneur great ceo
5683
etc they're great sales people
5685
i'm gonna shut the hell up but now about
5686
this one but nobody's smart in you
5688

5844
[Music]
5882
[Music]
5902
[Music]
5910
all right moving on to section number
5912
five uh this is all about uh ethics
5916
crucial ethics lessons to keep you out
5918
of trouble
5920
okay
5921
so the first one is number 25 which is
5924
transparency builds trust i really
5926
believe this you can lose your
5927
reputation really quickly in business
5929
and in life
5931
but if you're fully transparent uh then
5933
this will this will help your career a
5935
lot
5936
uh and what i mean by that is you always
5938
list the risks with with like remember
5940
we look through the uh the s ones for
5942
facebook goldman et cetera whatever and
5945
and there's a lot of risks you gotta be
5946
transparent and list all the risks and
5948
whenever you're selling something to
5949
somebody else you gotta tell yourself i
5952
feel comfortable selling this to my
5953
parents because i would tell my parents
5955
the risks as well so you gotta disclose
5957
all risk and that that is abraham
5959
lincoln right there honest abe
5961
uh and he was very very transparent as
5964
well and apparently a very good man yeah
5966
so that's that's honest honest abe uh or
5969
as wayne and garth and wayne's world
5970
referred him as babraham lincoln
5974
i don't know what that means
5975
but anyway uh transparency builds trust
5977
remember that always disclose risks um
5980
and the most important risk within the
5982
first within the first couple minutes of
5983
pitching any idea
5985
uh or or uh product or service or
5988
whatever it is or if you're trying to
5989
raise money
5990
because it'll make you come across as
5992
being you know more ethical too and you
5993
know what dude it might be a litigation
5995
issue if you don't disclose them uh and
5998
never sell a financial product or raise
6000
money without getting a lawyer to write
6001
your documents first because the lawyer
6003
will make sure that you're you know the
6005
risks are disclosed yeah transparency
6008
builds trust
6011
all right next up is don't trust this
6014
type of person here
6016
so
6018
what am i talking about here well well
6019
this type of person
6021
is the type of person that backstabs
6024
other people
6026
and if
6028
at work or at school or whatever
6030
somebody is gossiping and we all will
6032
enjoy gossip for whatever stupid reason
6034
right otherwise don't watch tmz
6037
um i'm a lawyer i don't know if you guys
6039
watch the show but whatever uh but but
6041
don't don't trust anybody that that
6043
gossips
6045
because and don't take part in yourself
6048
uh because like around the water
6050
fountain or water cooler at work
6052
whatever
6053
because those people that are
6055
gossiping about others they'll gospel at
6057
you as well
6058
they will
6059
and the worst type of person is the
6060
person that cheats on their
6062
spouse it's a sacred bond man
6065
you know if they cheat on their spouse
6067
of course they're gonna cheat you cheat
6069
you in business as well you can't trust
6071
them
6074
it's like somebody that backstabs their
6075
spouse to
6076
you of course you're going to backstab
6079
you
6080
about you to somebody else
6082
you can't trust these people
6084
you can't trust them so just just be
6086
careful just be careful there's a shadow
6088
yeah
6090
all right so just don't trust that type
6092
of person and don't get involved in
6093
gossip either uh and on wall street
6096
you know if if somebody
6099
i knew somebody got fired years ago
6102
because he told a client
6105
what one of his other clients which is
6106
fidelity big mutual fund what they own
6109
or what they said in the meeting
6110
whatever
6112
um and so that that client
6114
might be grateful at first they heard
6116
that information but they don't trust
6117
you it's just it's not worth it it's not
6119
worth it yeah yeah yeah and
6122
sir richard branson and he's he's he's a
6125
he's amazing
6126
and i've listened to his all his audio
6128
books on audible
6130
um he just oozes positivity and he sets
6132
the corporate culture for the virgin
6134
companies
6135
which is why um if you fly virgin
6137
atlantic or virgin america
6139
all the uh the people that work on the
6141
airline the pilots et cetera the
6143
they're the attendants they're they're
6144
all really really positive and upbeat
6147
um you know unfortunately alaska
6148
airlines bought uh virgin america
6150
recently so maybe the culture will get
6152
you know diluted whatever
6154
but but i i mentioned sir richard
6156
branson because
6158
his parents if he ever backstabbed
6160
anybody when he was a kid they would
6161
make him stand up and look in the mirror
6164
and they would say look at yourself
6166
don't be that person
6168
don't be that person that backstabs
6169
others
6171
and little quick little side note off
6172
topic
6174
i have a guy i used to work for or work
6176
with i should say years ago
6178
he's so well spoken
6180
and i got and i met his parents at some
6182
events
6183
uh and and and i asked uh i asked his
6186
parents i said
6187
you know mike mike is so well spoken
6189
he's a gentleman he's confident
6192
how did he become that way
6194
and in you know how did you raise him
6197
and my kids were younger there so i was
6198
asking
6199
and they said well you know we one thing
6201
we did
6203
was we would make him stand up and read
6206
to us
6207
and
6208
when he was reading to us we we made
6210
sure he projected his voice
6213
and he was comfortable you know thinking
6215
on his feet and and standing and reading
6218
uh because we we got him to do it so we
6221
didn't just make him read in his room
6222
and my mom made me mom and dad during
6224
the summers when i was a kid they make
6226
me read for one hour every day every day
6228
in the summers which helped me out
6230
tremendously and i do with my kids now
6232
too except i add a sweetener i say
6235
if you read within the first hour of
6237
being awake
6239
you can read you got to do it for 45
6241
minutes
6241
or if it's later on the day it's like an
6243
hour
6244
so i incentivize them you know yeah
6245
readers are leaders yeah
6249
yeah and actually also this guy mike the
6252
way that he learned how to public speak
6254
was i've never tried this but
6256
they would make him put a pencil in his
6258
mouth
6259
and then speak
6260
and then that would try to speak clearly
6262
that way so yeah
6266
all right moving on
6267
next up
6269
number 27 how to tell if somebody is
6272
lying that's pinocchio there right
6274
um
6276
does that mean i'm a liar because i got
6277
a big nose no it's aerodynamic though it
6280
is like dude when i'm skiing because of
6282
this
6282
like like when i tuck like i go fast
6285
like try to beat me in a bike race you
6287
can't because this is the aerodynamic
6288
side of it but i'm not a liar i'm not
6290
pinocchio i just have a very very
6292
aerodynamic nose okay all right
6295
if i can't laugh myself who can i laugh
6296
at that reminds me of a sting song
6298
an english man in new york which i love
6300
off of sting's album the dream of the
6302
blue turtles and sting said
6304
it takes a man to suffer ignorance and
6306
smile be yourself no matter what they
6308
say
6308
i love it so how do you tell if
6310
somebody's lying and i covered this
6311
before i think so i'm going to go into
6313
this really really quickly so when i
6314
worked at a great big hedge fund
6316
um
6318
and uh
6319
it was called citadel
6322
uh and uh
6324
ken griffin nice guy um he's the the
6327
founder billionaire he actually just
6329
bought the biggest house or the most
6331
expensive house in american history
6332
uh and i remember whenever i meet with
6334
him i spent an hour and a half with him
6336
or an hour actually a half hour with him
6337
one day in his office
6339
and we talked about video games for for
6340
ages and i looked at his bookshelf
6343
and whenever i used to go into
6344
somebody's office that's really
6345
successful
6347
more successful than me which is all the
6348
time i would look at what books they
6350
have and i'd order them immediately
6352
and the book that that ken had actually
6354
ken griffin
6356
was a damadorian book on finance which i
6358
bought and i i have now
6360
but when i was at citadel upper
6362
management
6363
uh they sent um
6366
they sent 25-year fbi and cia veterans
6369
uh to train us on how to tell somebody's
6370
lying
6372
so now i know how to lie now i'm scared
6374
but this really helped us a lot because
6376
at that time it was like oh five i think
6379
there was a lot of there are a lot of
6380
scandals on wall street ceos were lying
6383
and there was a joke on wall street
6384
which is how do you know if a ceo is
6386
lying
6388
when they move their lips
6390
but but they trained us on how to tell
6392
somebody's lying and it helped me a lot
6393
actually then while i was investing and
6395
now today a lot
6397
i can tell usually
6398
so the four criteria is false
6401
and
6402
you one data point is mega trend you
6404
usually need two three or four of these
6405
to be correct or at least two of them
6406
right at least two
6408
uh and everybody's a little different so
6409
there are exceptions so number one if
6412
somebody breaks eye contact uh when
6414
they're talking about something
6416
that means they're they're probably
6417
lying
6419
however
6420
i break eye contact a lot like i look
6421
down a lot it's just i've always been
6423
like that i look down sometimes right um
6426
maybe i come across as not being
6427
confident i don't know just what i do
6429
um but if somebody breaks eye contact
6432
when answering a question
6434
then they might be lying
6436
yeah and sometimes when people blink a
6438
lot
6439
they might be lying and dude i see it on
6441
tv all the time i see people lying on tv
6443
all the time
6445
especially athletes when they're asked
6447
are they going to come back to the team
6449
next year and do they want to come back
6451
they break eye contact
6454
sometimes they they ramble
6456
um but you'll notice it you'll notice it
6458
and watch when somebody is being um
6461
being interviewed on television just
6463
watch how they answer questions
6465
you know if if they look away
6467
only the only time they look away a lot
6469
is when they're answering a question
6470
about something they're lying about that
6471
might be a lie all right so number one
6473
is they they break eye contact
6476
number two is if somebody rambles on and
6479
on and on and on and on and on and on
6480
and on kind of like i am right now
6483
to a simple yes or no question you know
6484
it's like a kid
6486
you ask a kid did you did you did you
6488
did you take the last cookie from the
6490
cookie jar
6491
no i didn't take a last quarter i mean i
6493
can't even reach it i mean look how tall
6494
it's it's high up there and then i don't
6495
know where the ladder is it's over there
6497
but you know what i mean with steps tool
6498
i can't find it's right there by the way
6499
but i yeah
6503
so there's that so we talked about um
6505
breaking eye contact we talked about
6507
rambling
6508
uh another one is if if somebody is
6511
shaking their foot and you can look down
6513
and see it sometimes when they're lying
6515
um and and sometimes because they've had
6517
too much caffeine which obviously means
6519
they get a hall pass
6521
but if somebody's shaking their foot a
6523
lot whatever when they're answering a
6524
question they could be lying and that's
6526
what a lie detector test does remember
6528
remember ben stiller and robert de niro
6531
and meet the parents right so that's
6533
anyway that's what they were testing
6535
he was cia i think in that movie
6537
yeah and there's there's one more oh
6538
yeah yeah touching your face touching
6541
your face yeah
6542
so uh if if if you touch your face a lot
6545
especially cover your mouth
6547
um and you usually don't do that but you
6549
do that when you're answering a question
6550
you might be lying so
6552
don't don't accept just one of those
6553
four criteria as being
6556
gospel that somebody's lying
6558
but multiple two or more of them could
6560
mean somebody is lying and speaking of
6562
touching your face and going off script
6564
again here
6566
of course given the health crisis we've
6568
all got these things um
6570
but what i do with my uh my kids and
6572
myself now is like and i went to my
6575
doctor years ago actually and i asked
6577
her i said why are you not sick all the
6578
time and she says because i wash my
6580
hands a lot and i never touch my face
6582
and so for me i've been biting my nails
6585
dude since i was born i i just i i do it
6588
it's it's terrible
6590
and my kids do it as well because monkey
6592
see monkey do you know whatever
6594
so what i did was i bought this stuff
6595
here it's called pro bell
6597
and um given the virus scare right now i
6599
put this on my nails
6601
and i put on my kid's nails as well
6603
and it tastes awful right it's not
6605
doesn't hurt yet but it just tastes
6606
awful but anyway
6608
a little off topic but interesting
6610
nonetheless
6611
so that's how you can tell if somebody
6613
is lying yeah
6616
all right next up is how to destroy your
6617
career in 30 seconds or less
6622
if you send an email or a text or or a
6625
snapchat and those are forever
6627
and you didn't think two or three times
6629
about it before clicking the send button
6631
you're done
6632
you're done just just be careful just be
6634
careful
6635
and
6636
i always know that emails are for life
6639
and everything i say on the phone is for
6641
life as well you know when i worked on
6642
wall street they used to say
6644
um just understand that
6646
all your calls could be recorded by the
6649
government the fbi whatever i was like
6651
that's fine i'm never going to do
6653
anything unethical anyway
6655
but that's
6656
you got to do that and sometimes they'll
6657
say
6658
this call is being recorded for for
6660
quality assurances or whatever or if you
6662
hear a beep in the background you're
6664
being recorded and they tell you to and
6666
it's totally bogus like when customer
6668
service calls you or you call them to
6670
get help and they're recording the call
6672
really like try it with them
6674
yeah can you help me oh by the way i'm
6675
recording this call
6677
what is that so a little off topic but
6679
just be really careful with electronic
6682
stuff email voicemail voice every it's
6684
all it's all recorded man you know the
6687
privacy died a decade or two ago you
6690
know once we realized there's a death of
6691
distance in privacy because the internet
6693
okay next up

6735
[Music]

[Music]
6800
[Music]
6818
[Music]
6839
[Music]
6877
[Music]
6905
let's move on to section number six now
6907
so section number six is every battle is
6910
won before it's been fought it's a
6912
famous quote from sun tzu and the art of
6914
war
6915
and at the top there i wrote crucial
6917
battle preparation lessons and i've used
6919
that quote before from sun tzu so i'll
6921
go through this quickly
6923
all right so number one
6925
the first thing to talk about in section
6927
number six is
6930
over prepare for everything
6933
if you over prepare for something like
6935
really over prepare
6936
you actually will enjoy it
6939
when you're actually
6940
doing what you prepared for
6942
so like when you over prepare for a
6945
speech which i've i've done many many
6947
times before
6948
i get to the speech and i'm so ready
6952
i just kind of enjoy it man
6954
i can't explain it it's like
6956
this is out there but you remember when
6957
you were younger and you studied really
6960
hard for a math test like really really
6962
hard and your friends asked you for help
6964
and and you gave them help as well and
6966
you know when one teaches to learn
6969
but you you you studied a lot for it
6972
and then when you get into the exam
6974
it's so easy that you actually enjoy it
6978
you know you're you're comfortable
6979
you're confident you double check your
6981
work as always of course
6983
um but you enjoy it
6985
you know the exam is your friend
6988
you enjoy it because you over prepared
6992
and what i do also is when i give a
6994
speech quite often i bring two laptops
6997
and what i used to do is i would bring
6999
my laptop with powerpoint on whatever
7000
years ago and i would be i would bring
7003
uh those overhead slide things as well
7005
just in case just in case it broke down
7008
and when management at goldman sachs saw
7010
me do that like oh my gosh that's
7011
amazing i have confidence in this kit
7014
and when i give a speech at my brother's
7015
wedding back in 0-4 i did the same thing
7017
i had backups just in case just in case
7021
yeah
7022
so over prepare for for everything
7024
please and
7025
you know whenever when i used to
7026
interview other companies
7028
i prepare more than anybody like i
7030
recorded myself answering over 100
7032
questions i video recorded myself too
7035
did i sound too monotone did i sound too
7037
arrogant
7038
did i pause enough
7040
did i use frameworks to tie together my
7043
logic when i was lost in terms of moving
7046
on to the bottom line is
7049
and so if you over prepare for
7050
everything
7052
then
7053
you'll actually enjoy the event when it
7055
occurs
7056
because quite often life all comes down
7058
to a few short moments
7060
the crucial speech or a test or whatever
7062
it is
7063
so over prepare
7065
you know
7066
like i i i know that i work harder than
7068
anybody and i think it's because when i
7070
was younger they they thought i had a
7072
learning disability and they want to
7074
fail me in the sixth grade in the eighth
7076
grade and screw them whatever
7078
not my my not my parents my teachers
7081
uh and so i i kind of grew up insecure
7085
and i over prepared for everything and
7087
i'm so grateful to god that they kind of
7090
misdiagnosed me or whatever it was they
7092
tried to
7093
destroy my confidence
7094
i'm grateful to god it happened because
7096
i over prepare for everything now
7097
because of it
7099
and there's a great book by malcolm
7100
globwell called um
7103
david and goliath
7105
and it's about how people that have been
7106
told their whole lives that they're not
7108
good enough
7109
are the ones that ultimately
7112
do stuff that's important
7115
so if if people have told you your whole
7117
life or when you were younger and if
7118
your confidence is lower than it should
7120
be
7122
just
7123
be grateful that whatever happens within
7126
reason obviously
7127
whatever happened happened because your
7129
secret weapon is you're going to work
7130
your ass off work harder than anybody
7133
else
7134
and i've always worked harder than
7135
anybody and i keep pushing the goal post
7137
out and challenging myself and i think a
7139
lot of it stems to you know it's it's
7142
it's
7143
nurture and nature
7145
you know and you look at your kids why
7146
are they successful or not or whatever
7148
who cares
7149
i mean success should be what they think
7151
of themselves right you want to raise
7152
confidence kids but you you know
7154
somebody is
7155
reaches their full potential in life
7157
because of nurture or nature
7159
so for for me part of it is nature it's
7161
part of everybody but it's nurture
7163
always you know being told when i was
7164
younger you can't do it you can't do you
7165
can't do it or elon musk poor guy in
7169
south africa he got the crap kicked out
7170
of him a lot growing up
7172
or steven spielberg
7173
you know been you know being
7176
diagnosed with with um
7178
with with uh
7180
i think it was a dyslexia i can't
7182
remember yeah
7184
um and and he didn't get into usc film
7186
school he didn't get in which is the
7188
best film school so chip on his shoulder
7190
which is great just great i'm sure i'm
7192
sure there's more to it than that
7194
but but sometimes i feel like if i hire
7195
people from from harvard business school
7197
they're going to be entitled as hell
7199
and a lot of times like i'll i'll
7201
lecture
7202
at
7203
a lot of schools and there's one in
7205
particular in the bay area
7207
that i hate lecturing at now
7209
because
7210
there is insane entitlement and
7213
arrogance from a lot of the students
7215
i'm not going to name that school
7218
but my favorite school in the bay area
7221
is san francisco state i love those kids
7223
of death love no death i've hired them
7225
i'll continue to hire them they're the
7226
best
7227
a lot of them are wealthy but a lot are
7228
not and a lot are not entitled the worst
7231
thing possible is hiring somebody that's
7233
entitled
7235
you know it's like like they start and
7237
they're like i don't have to sweep the
7238
floor it's like oh here's a broom let me
7239
teach you
7242
over prepare for everything
7245
all right i love hiring people that are
7246
poor smart and hungry
7248
number 30 is the ohair test pass it and
7250
watch your career take off
7253
so the o'hare
7254
test is the chicago o'hare airport
7257
is a big airport that's one of the
7258
biggest ones
7260
and
7261
quite and i've spent a lot of time there
7263
like eight hours waiting in between
7265
flights and
7266
quite often with somebody else at work
7268
you know someone more senior than me
7270
whatever
7271
and
7272
did they enjoy my company and vice versa
7274
in that eight hour layover the o hair
7276
test it's important relationships are
7278
more important than product knowledge
7279
let me move
7280
on all right oh i got this one from my
7283
dad
7284
my dad said chichi
7286
never take a short that's my nickname
7288
growing up chichi
7289
never take a shortcut you've never taken
7291
before when you're in a hurry i
7293
completely believe that and you've all
7294
been through that too i know every
7296
single one of you have
7297
you're late for something you're driving
7299
whatever you're like oh i got to cut a
7301
corner you know i got let me take a
7302
shortcut i've never taken before and
7304
you're even later than if you've gone
7306
the regular routes
7307
there's no shortcuts in life so i think
7310
that's important to keep in mind
7313
all right so we are now done uh with
7315
section number six
7317
okay and so as always we're going to do
7319
next is we're going to do an exercise
7322
go to
7323
the cover page here if you want
7325
and click on number six or you can do it
7328
up here i always love to have multiple
7329
ways to access stuff
7331
and spend three minutes uh writing down
7333
notes here uh in in all the lessons
7336
uh for uh for section six
7339
on
7340
using the stuff you've learned this
7342
lesson to help to enhance your career
7345
so you got three minutes to do this go
7349
[Music]
7387
do
7392
[Music]
7399
do
7401
[Music]
7426
so
7428
[Music]
7439
[Music]
7498
[Music]
7526
moving on to section number seven you
7528
can hear me using my transition words
7530
here
7531
okay so uh
7532
goal setting okay follow these crucial
7535
steps and achieve your dreams and see if
7538
you guys can tell me what trophy that's
7539
from
7541
trying to be global here
7543
okay so the first lesson here that's
7545
number 32 is run to your fears
7550
whatever you're most scared of in life
7552
i want you to run to those fears
7554
because i promise you
7556
your competition is probably just as
7558
scared they just don't say it
7561
so whatever you're most fearful of in
7563
business or in life in general run
7565
towards it if you're scared of
7566
accounting
7568
condition yourself to enjoy it learn it
7570
better in your competition have fun with
7572
it too and always question why things
7574
are called what they're called like we
7575
talked before
7577
about understanding math like we we
7579
talked about the the banana i ain't
7581
falling for no banana the tailpipe we
7583
talked about the banana on the
7584
denominator
7585
we talked about the balance sheet it's
7587
got a balance so just understand stuff
7590
and condition yourself to understand
7592
stuff and enjoy stuff that you're
7593
fearful of
7594
meaning accounting or whatever it is if
7596
it scares you it scares your competition
7598
just as much i promise you
7599
so understand it and condition yourself
7601
to enjoy it maybe
7603
i don't know maybe like when you're
7605
learning accounting wherever it is get
7606
yourself a nice cup of coffee and listen
7609
nice classical music in the backgrounds
7611
um
7612
you know and if you're having uh
7614
problems doing that then remember when
7616
you're younger and you went to the
7617
library you remember the exact table you
7619
sat at
7620
deep in the stacks downstairs in that
7622
corner
7624
and you had your your music on and
7626
coffee go back there recreate that
7628
environment
7630
okay
7631
so run to your fears brenda your fears
7633
and i put a shark tank there on purpose
7635
uh and and if you're absolutely
7636
terrified of sharks
7638
why not try that and i found this
7640
picture here i actually got on adobe i i
7642
subscribe to a service where i get
7644
images
7646
so um there's actually it's actually a
7647
cage you can do with a bunch of others
7649
right so um
7651
a little bit scary for me but i want to
7653
get the point across and never have you
7654
forget it run to your fears if you're
7656
scared of public speaking
7658
put yourself out there man
7660
move to open spaces make yourself do it
7664
run to your fears conquer your fear
7667
because you'll never reach your full
7668
potential in life unless you conquer
7669
your fears
7672
all right next up is uh make a gap
7675
analysis and so
7677
i i love this analogy here
7679
um of of the mountain
7682
so if your goal
7685
is to accomplish something so big and
7688
we'll just say it's the top of the
7689
mountain
7690
then i want you to visualize success
7693
and just think about
7695
what do you need to do to fill that gap
7696
between where you are now and the top of
7698
the mountain okay so make a very basic
7701
gap analysis as part of your
7702
goal-setting strategy
7705
okay now lesson number 34 is
7708
yale university's fascinating goal
7710
setting study okay and some people say
7712
this is an urban legend or myth i don't
7714
care i want to talk about it anyway
7717
so in 1950
7720
yale university which is in the
7721
northeast of the united states yale
7724
university what they did in 1950 was
7725
they asked their their graduating class
7728
how many of you have written down your
7730
goals
7731
and three percent said
7733
i have written down my goals
7735
then 20 years later they went back to
7738
the same graduating class in 1970
7742
and they calculated the net worth
7744
of everybody that graduated 1950 20
7746
years later
7748
and the net worth of the three percent
7749
that had written down their goals
7751
was greater than the other 97 combined
7755
it's pretty amazing pretty amazing so
7758
don't forget to write down your goals
7759
and i used to carry my goals everywhere
7761
with me they're now on my my iphone in
7763
my calendar they repeat daily but what i
7765
used to do was i would print out i would
7766
buy those remember those those business
7768
cards you can make yourself you put in
7770
your printer and you pop them out and
7772
they look awful whatever
7773
i would get those
7775
and then i would use powerpoint i
7776
remember and just kind of write down
7778
type my goals on the back in front of 10
7781
cards and carry them around with me
7782
everywhere and when i was down and out
7784
i'd read through them
7785
and i'm humbled to say i've accomplished
7787
pretty much every goal
7788
um one of the exceptions is uh
7792
not getting a black belt in karate but
7794
i'm a mean yellow belt yeah
7799
all right uh next up is number 35 should
7802
you get a graduate degree so you go to
7804
university
7806
um i i would say that if you network a
7809
lot
7810
and you still can't get
7812
that career change
7814
like if you set up literally a hundred
7816
networking meetings
7817
i found this
7818
that's i don't know that's siri talking
7820
again sorry put her aside it's a daily
7822
event
7824
right
7825
so
7827
uh if you set up a hundred networking
7829
meetings and you still can't change
7830
careers
7831
then consider getting your graduate
7833
degree
7834
that's what i would say that's what i
7836
would say yeah uh and you might say
7838
chris 100 is a little extreme
7840
well dude getting a graduate degree at
7843
university it can cost a hundred grand
7845
including lost wages etc
7848
100 grand
7849
so that means that a thousand or 100
7851
meetings
7853
that's like a thousand dollars each
7854
meeting i'm saving you
7856
so again do a hundred meetings i know it
7859
sounds like a lot and when i say 100 it
7861
probably means you'll do 30. and you'll
7862
still get what you want because you did
7863
30.
7864
like james cameron said set your goals
7866
so high that if you fail you still fail
7868
above everyone else's expectations
7871
it's kind of like we did cryptocurrency
7873
stuff i didn't really expect you guys to
7874
do all 49 steps
7876
but if you do a lot of them that's
7878
that's better than just one or two or
7880
not right
7881
okay and what you can also do is if you
7883
try your best to network to make that
7884
career change and you can't
7887
then um
7888
go to linkedin and find people that have
7890
done it and look at their blueprints do
7892
they have graduate degrees what have
7893
they done to get there
7894
but i guarantee you i almost guarantee
7896
you if you network like crazy you can
7898
you get pretty much where you want in
7899
life
7900
obviously there's exceptions if you want
7901
to be a doctor
7903
you know
7904
you have to go to medical school
7905
although i'm on the board of a charity
7907
i'm really proud of called doctors
7909
without diplomas yeah
7912
that's not true yeah
7915
okay number number 36 i love this one
7917
push the goal post out
7920
um
7921
once you achieve your goals
7923
what you got to do is you got to you
7925
gotta you gotta push the goal post out
7927
you you gotta set new goals always
7929
because sometimes when you achieve your
7931
goals
7932
you get a little bit depressed
7933
i know it's weird like at first you're
7935
like hey i did it you're like
7937
dude now what
7939
got to keep pushing the goal post out
7942
keep challenging yourself
7944
uh and if you get a chance i want you to
7946
please go and do a search on matthew
7948
mcconaughey's best oscar speech from
7951
things 2014 or maybe a little bit before
7953
that i don't remember
7954
but he talks about
7956
competing with himself
7958
and challenging himself and it was
7959
amazing oscar speech i love it to death
7962
because he was so real
7964
he didn't give a damn what people
7965
thought about him he was talking to his
7967
dad up in heaven
7969
and he was saying
7971
dad i love you
7973
i know you're up there
7974
in your underpants probably
7976
with lemon pie
7979
with a can of miller light and you're
7981
dancing
7982
he didn't care then he talked about
7985
challenging himself so watch that that
7986
speech if you get a chance it's pretty
7988
powerful
7989
that's right from his heart
7990
you know and as maya angelou said
7994
people might not remember what you said
7996
but they'll never forget the way you
7997
made them feel i really believe that and
8000
when i get my explain you how to give a
8002
great speech
8003
um which you have to learn thoroughly um
8006
if you're gonna write a business plan
8007
because when you write a business plan
8009
and you present it to potential
8011
investors
8012
you got to inspire them as well
8014
and i'm going to teach you you know how
8016
to give a presentation
8017
um like uh like matthew mcconaughey did
8020
and i think he got the award for dallas
8022
buyer's club or some movie back then yet
8025
all right so we are now done with
8026
section number seven which is which is
8028
goal setting
8030
so as always i want you to please go
8032
to your workbook
8034
and then i want you to go to section
8036
seven
8037
and then spend um it's working
8040
sometimes that's double click yeah uh
8042
and then just spend uh spend three
8044
minutes uh going through um all the
8047
lessons here
8048
and document how you can apply some of
8050
the stuff you've learned to enhance your
8052
career and what you can always do of
8054
course is is for homework
8056
if you want it's all optional
8058
is you can read through the chapters
8060
here and so i provide you this is half
8062
the book today and next class i'll
8064
provide you with the other half of the
8065
book in next classes uh workbook
8068
as well and i thought about giving you
8070
the actual book and i said no way man i
8072
want it this way so you you at least
8074
have the option to write down notes
8077
because one little note you take in
8078
these boxes can change your life
8082
yeah you can have a breakthrough
8083
personal breakthrough yeah
8086
all right so
8088
take uh three minutes to do that now go
8091
[Music]
8125
[Music]
8163
[Music]
8181
[Music]
8202
[Music]
8241
[Music]
8254
do
8260
[Music]
8268
moving on to section number eight
8270
this is a great one
8272
so section number eight is simply called
8274
happiness is and i want to spell that
8276
h-a-p-p-y
8278
n-e-s-s there's a famous movie where
8281
they spell happiness with a y what movie
8283
was that you should have all seen it by
8285
now
8286
if not rent it's got my favorite actor
8287
in it ever will smith yeah
8291
uh and and if you didn't
8293
you're probably younger than me i'm an
8294
old man but if you didn't watch the
8296
fresh prince of bel-air ever watch it on
8298
netflix or online it's great and we'll
8300
we'll suppose the best i love that guy
8302
he's so inspirational too he's amazing
8303
he's amazing
8304
so um section number eight i wrote the
8307
top there it's crucial that you find an
8309
occupation you love and you'll never
8311
work a day in your life of course that's
8313
of course that's a very famous quote
8314
from confucius
8317
all right number 37 here is
8320
don't have a job instead have a passion
8323
and be happy and achieve all your
8326
business goals and if you get up in the
8328
morning and you tell yourself i'm going
8329
to work with all due respect you're
8331
doing it wrong
8333
you you got to find your your your
8334
purpose your passion you know what was
8337
the reason that that
8338
you were put on this earth
8341
so so find your passion
8343
and once you do as confucius said you'll
8345
never work a day for the rest of your
8347
life and
8348
it's like having a new baby you know
8350
when you have your first baby
8352
some of you might know
8353
[Music]
8355
you unlock a level of happiness you
8356
never thought you could feel in your
8358
life
8360
well when you get up every day and do
8361
what you love doing
8362
it's the same feelings that not as good
8365
but a little bit you know a little bit
8367
of that uh lightning in a bottle you
8369
feel it
8370
feel it inside here
8372
um that's that's that's pure happiness
8375
pure joy pure adrenaline
8377
uh pure euphoria when you do what you
8380
love doing and it might take you a while
8381
you know sometimes it might take to your
8383
60s figure it out took me to my 40s
8386
and i'm 73 now so um yeah
8391
all right moving on number uh oh guys
8394
laugh your failures watch this video
8405
dude that i love the internet was made
8407
just for that
8409
i love that video it's hysterical and
8412
whenever you think about your failures i
8414
want to condition you to laugh at your
8415
failures you'll find humor in it you
8418
know to a certain extent
8420
um
8422
yeah anyway so i i i look at my failures
8424
in life and i laugh at them they're fun
8426
they're funny i don't know
8428
so
8429
condition yourself to kind of laugh your
8430
failures and you won't take life too
8432
seriously you'll live longer you'll be
8433
happier
8435
and you'll be willing to fail again so
8436
you can laugh again
8440
all right next up is uh money does not
8443
equal uh happiness yeah
8447
so i i i had a trip to um mumbai
8451
uh business trip years ago i think it
8453
was
8454
halt international school of business
8455
wanted me to give a speech or a couple
8456
speeches so i did it there in up in
8458
delhi as well
8460
and that trip changed me man
8463
it changed me because when we drove from
8465
the airport to the four seasons in
8467
mumbai whatever and mumbai's there's 25
8469
million people
8470
tons of rich people there but there's
8472
also a large number of people that that
8473
live in the slums
8475
and we were stuck in traffic thank god
8478
because it was right by the slums and
8481
i've never seen so many people with
8483
nothing
8484
so happy
8486
they were so happy
8488
it's kind of like when um i remember
8490
matthew my youngest kid
8494
we used to go to the park on sundays
8497
and
8499
there was always a large group
8502
of
8503
people from
8504
immigrants
8506
and they would sit on they had nothing
8509
like we had a nice blanket to sit on
8511
they had cardboard boxes and they would
8513
barbecue
8515
and there was tons of them
8517
together in a family
8519
you know a bond of love
8521
and my son matthew he was like four of
8523
them he said daddy why
8526
why do they always seem so much happier
8528
than everybody else
8530
they got nothing to lose you know you
8532
want to buy experiences not things
8535
and then you go to an expensive
8536
restaurant look around dude when you go
8538
to expensive restaurant look around
8540
you see all these arrogant people
8542
whatever and i like going at good
8544
restaurants whatever but they're not as
8546
happy as when you go to a park
8549
you know it's sometimes i feel like like
8551
david geffen
8553
he's a billionaire and
8555
no high school degree started in the
8556
mail room and he uh
8558
he started guffing records he signed
8560
guns or roses and
8562
other bands whatever
8564
um and then he's one third of dreamworks
8566
as well along with katzenbergen and
8568
spielberg but but david geffen said
8572
for those of you that think that money
8574
can buy you happiness you don't have
8575
money
8577
it's it does not buy happiness at all i
8579
promise you and and i remember uh when i
8582
worked at goldman
8584
every christmas you get you got a bonus
8587
everyone was so damn depressed every
8588
christmas
8589
because the cancer of wall street
8591
and western society is you always
8594
compare yourselves to those that have
8596
more you know when you look into the
8599
bowl of your neighbor
8601
you shouldn't look to see if you have
8603
more
8604
you you should look to see if if he or
8606
she has enough or at least as much as
8608
you do
8609
yeah
8610
so money no matter what you think
8613
does not buy happiness of course we need
8615
to make a certain amount to live
8617
but
8620
don't make money your god
8622
you know it's it's one of the ten
8623
commandments not to do something like
8624
that so um
8627
yeah so anyway
8629
and there's there's a great british
8630
airways commercial
8632
that that i want to share with you soon
8634
um
8636
that was filmed in new york in india
8639
that really touched my heart
8641
and really makes you focus on family and
8644
what real happiness is
8647

8665
i grew up there
8668
[Music]
8670
what do i remember from bombay
8673
well
8674
playing in the streets
8678
taking the local
8682

8687
and
8688
my mother praying in the morning
8691
you can move thousands of miles away
8694
but these images
8696
they are always with you
8702
[Applause]
8706
[Music]
8714
i am alka my full name is
8718
i am 61 years old
8722
my son is ratnesh he's staying in new
8725
york
8726
first when he told me he wanted to go to
8728
the u.s i felt very excited but when the
8731
moment came when he was leaving india
8734
that time i was really very nervous and
8738
quite heartbroken i must say
8740
[Music]
8747
today british airways has given me a
8750
seat on a plane
8752
it is for my son's favorite dish okra
8755
paratha
8757
they will fly to america
8759
and surprise him in his apartment
8762
i think this will make him come home and
8765
visit his mummy
8769
i like every mother does i used to
8771
experiment with different things putting
8773
in his different box
8775
most of the time the other vegetables
8778
they will return from the school
8779
untouched
8780
but whenever i am giving okra it is
8782
finished
8784
i asked him why you like okra the most
8786
he said mama
8788
my teacher has told the child who eats
8791
okra becomes best in his mathematics
8796
my son is progressing day by day
8799
his dreams are getting fulfilled
8803
and his happiness is more than what i
8806
ever want for him
8808
when he will look at the tiffin box
8810
first he will think from where has it
8812
come but once he tastes the food he will
8815
know it is made by his mummy
8819
and i am sure he will start searching
8821
for me in his apartment
8825
i miss him so much because when he left
8828
home he was hardly 17 years old
8834
and from that day
8838
he did not return home
8842
i miss myself
8847
[Music]
8850
my mom had cooked my favorite meal
8852
and she was waiting for someone from
8854
british areas to pick up the different
8855
carrier
8858
so they sent me
8861
after flying from new york to mumbai
8864
there i was
8866
walking to her door
8867
smelling her cooking
8869
it was an incredible feeling
8872
sometimes even when you know what's
8873
going to happen
8875
you cannot even imagine how it's going
8876
to be
8879
i got the opportunity to see my mother
8881
in a way had never seen her before
8887
she looked lonely
8889
she looked like she sounds over the
8890
phone i just wanted to run out and give
8893
her a hug
8895
[Music]
8901
mommy
8904
i'm here
8907
oh
8910
[Music]
8925
it was a great moment
8927
it was a family moment even his dad was
8930
there
8931
we are three of us sad we talked
8934
and
8935
i didn't ask him when are you leaving i
8938
said i will not ask you today
8940
let this question be for tomorrow
8956
[Music]
8967
what a great commercial man
8969
um
8971
just appreciate what you have that's
8973
what happiness is
8975
not hoping
8977
to get something later that will make
8978
you happier thing-wise
8981
but
8982
happiness is just
8984
appreciating what you have
8987
that's what it is
8989
and i believe that if you're happy and
8990
if this works
8992
this will work much much better
8994
you'll come full circle
8999
okay next up is all your wealth can't
9002
buy you health it's so true
9005
um and
9007
that that's a quote i think from i think
9009
i got it from bob dylan yeah all your
9010
wealth can't buy your health
9012
uh and there's a great book by the the
9014
dalai lama that i mentioned before
9017
i read it on my honeymoon and when i was
9019
in indonesia which is a great setting
9022
and
9023
read his book if you haven't yet but but
9024
he says basically that
9028
the problem with western society is we
9030
sacrifice
9032
our health our entire lives in order to
9034
make money
9037
then at the end of our lives we
9038
sacrifice all of our money to maintain
9041
our health
9043
and then we look back
9045
and we realize
9047
we never really lived to begin with
9051
so treasure every single day
9054
every day
9056
smell the roses along the way i used to
9058
tell myself years ago when i was in my
9060
20s i was like i don't get married have
9062
kids until i make my fortune in my
9064
empire dude
9066
what's the point
9069
start a family now enjoy life today
9073
don't live for tomorrow
9075
live for today
9080
number 42 is when to change careers
9084
and
9085
i hate to end this on a down note but i
9088
have to in order to make a big impact
9091
like i mentioned before if you get out
9093
of bed in the morning
9094
and you're not happy
9096
and you feel some sort of depression
9099
related to your job
9103
channel that frustration and that
9105
unhappiness
9108
network like crazy
9110
channel that frustration
9112
and find something you love doing
9114
you know don't only focus on money i get
9116
it we have to pay bills i get it but
9118
enough's enough dude
9120
like at some point you got to realize
9121
that
9122
what am i here for
9127
why don't i laugh as much as i used to
9129
when i was younger
9131
why am i working in a big company i'm
9133
not being myself
9135
when i was younger i used to laugh so
9136
hard until i fell down with my buddies
9138
and it hurt in a good way
9142
why am i not laughing anymore
9144
why am i not being myself
9147
why do i get up every day and go to a
9149
job i can't stand working for people i
9151
don't respect
9153
and i don't respect myself as much
9155
anymore because i'm not being myself
9157
either i'm being political at work i'm
9159
not being me
9162
i just want to be me
9165
so if you're depressed
9167
and if you don't see work
9170
as something you enjoy
9172
don't do it
9173
you know don't try to live somebody
9175
else's life or or or be a prisoner in
9178
someone else's mind and do stuff to make
9181
them happy
9183
like if people in your life want you to
9185
be a lawyer or doctor whatever it is
9188
and you're not passionate about wanting
9190
to be a lawyer meaning you don't want to
9191
be a liar
9194
and you're not passionate about
9196
being a doctor because you want to be
9197
around blood and stuff if that's not
9201
i mean it's great to help people
9203
and i respect you know all doctors
9206
and um
9207
civil rights lawyers only
9210
but
9211
you got to do it what drives you makes
9213
you happy because i really do believe
9215
that if you
9216
if you do something you love doing in
9218
life you find the why of your life
9224
then you'll
9225
not only be good at it
9227
but the money will come accidentally
9229
you won't
9230
i mean i i go to a basketball game or a
9232
football game or whatever
9234
and all these dudes on the field
9236
they don't get up in the morning and say
9238
oh god i gotta go play a game today
9241
that's not work man that's awesome
9243
same thing with rock and roll star
9245
you know they don't get up in the
9246
morning oh god i gotta play another gig
9248
today
9251
it's a beautiful thing to be an artist
9252
because you get to express yourself
9255
which is why also like i think of what i
9257
do and what we all do as as being art
9261
you know the the palette for us is a
9263
powerpoint document or an excel
9266
spreadsheet that we can we can jazz up
9268
with cool buttons and colors and fun
9271
stuff
9272
it's artistic and it's fun for me and
9275
for you as well
9277
but
9279
you got to do something you love doing
9280
in life
9281
and you got to take risks as well and
9283
start your own companies on the side
9286
and in semesters three and four we'll
9287
you'll you'll write a kick-ass business
9289
plan and i'll help you
9290
kind of define what
9292
it might look like in the future for you
9294
but
9295
the worst thing can happen to you is
9297
you're
9298
you wake up one day and you're way older
9300
than you are now
9302
and
9304
you're working for this jerk
9306
that pays you
9307
this much money
9309
to make their dreams become a reality
9312
you got to take chance to take risks
9314
if you're not happy doing what you're
9315
doing either
9317
change your line of work by networking a
9318
lot or do a ton of side hustles on the
9322
side
9324
until you find something you're
9325
passionate about you know and that's
9327
kind of what i did too i i was working
9329
venture capital
9330
i wasn't happy i loved teaching
9332
and my side hustle was was teaching and
9334
then also putting stuff online like this
9338
um
9340
i didn't do it for the money
9342
i did it because i wanted to help like i
9343
want to help those those kids at the
9345
limo foundation that was fun for me
9348
helping
9349
it gave me a sense of purpose my why as
9351
well
9352
so if you get up in the morning and you
9355
tell yourself you're going to work then
9358
you got to find a different career path
9360
and start networking a lot to meet with
9362
people that work in different industries

the powerpoint version downloaded you
9894
can you can change this around uh if you
9896
want to okay
9897
so
9898
um you'll notice that not all the fields
9901
can be changed so what you can do if you
9903
want to change it you can go to view
9906
then you go to slide master
9908
and you can change the stuff here so
9910
let's just say that
9911
one of the uh the things you wrote down
9914
was i don't know
9920
let's think about this
9922
maybe it was to oh schedule time with
9924
family spend more time with family
9926
so what you can do is if you wanted to
9929
you can do what i do which is what i do
9932
down here uh you you can right here just
9934
hard coded in here so it's here every
9935
day
9936
right here
9938
you can go here and type in schedule
9940
time with family
9942
time with family
9946
or or go to the gym every day hard-coded
9949
in here so it's always here
9951
i don't know
9953
gym time
9954
that sort of thing or whatever 42
9956
lessons you learned and you can even
9957
change this around too you're like you
9958
know what chris i don't even use this
9960
part of it so let me just highlight all
9962
this this stuff here and
9965
let me get rid of actually just these
9966
ones here let me get rid of this
9969
and you could say did you go to the gym
9971
i don't know jim
9973
question mark and then you can change it
9975
so you you fill an x in here or whatever
9977
it is or get rid of this entirely and
9978
just i don't know write write down your
9980
your goals here completely so click here
9983
get rid of these bad dudes here these
9985
dudes here i should say
9986
and then just write down some of your
9988
goals that you want to appear here daily
9991
goals to be here
9994
daily
9996
from the 42 lessons or whatever it was
9998
you you typed stuff you want to keep in
10000
mind remember here you can change all
10001
this stuff and i wrote this in tiny blue
10004
writing why did i write that again i'm
10006
sure it's my moronic sense of humor
10008
i wrote here sorry to make you zoom in
10010
this much but i never want you to forget
10011
this
10012
if you want to get something done give
10014
it to a busy person the more you
10016
schedule the more you will do the more
10018
you will get done as well also if you
10019
write down your goals almost every
10021
single day then watch out because you
10022
will accomplish them all tell people
10025
about your goals and set deadline dates

10085
the second half of the this book here
10087
today it's going to be plenty of
10088
exercises now you're probably thinking
10090
chris what is going on why do you have
10093
this thing up here
10094
uh well i want to do something a little
10096
bit different today before we we jumped
10098
right in on it um
10101
when i was a kid
10103
i remember laughing so hard until it
10106
hurt
10108
and
10109
with my friends you know what i'm
10110
talking about like yeah sometimes you're
10112
rolling on the ground laughing so hard
10113
and then what happens is you
10115
i don't know you kind of grow up and you
10118
you stop laughing as much and you start
10120
working for other people
10122
and you're just not yourself anymore
10125
and and
10126
this really hit home for me because this
10128
here is um
10130
this is a a chair
10132
from uh exhibition stadium uh which is a
10135
a great stadium that no longer exists in
10138
toronto
10139
and it was for the the blue jays
10141
actually the toronto blue jays my
10142
baseball team i'm so passionate about
10144
sports
10145
and you can see i've got a big ticket up
10146
there as well for the first game in
10148
1977. tickets were really really big
10151
back then but now people are
10152
environmentally environmentally friendly
10155
dad here we know i promise
10157
but the one thing that my dad my brother
10159
my family and i my sisters my mom and we
10161
all have in common is a love of baseball
10163
and love of sports uh love of the
10165
toronto blue jays uh i'm feeling
10167
homesick just thinking about it uh and
10169
so i bought this uh it wasn't that
10171
expensive it's it's it's old it's rusty
10173
as you can tell i bought this on on ebay
10175
and get anything on ebay
10176
and it reminds me of the great times i
10178
had with my dad my my my family going to
10181
to games growing up and you know when i
10184
was a kid i didn't i didn't realize that
10187
baseball was a business or sports was a
10189
business and that's why it meant like i
10191
still love sports i still love baseball
10193
and the blue jays especially
10195
but um
10197
it meant a lot more to me when i was
10198
younger yeah and i just want to cherish
10200
these memories and you know sometimes
10203
when i um
10204
when i'm not in the best of moods or i'm
10206
kind of upset or depressed a bit which
10209
happens
10210
um i i think about when i was younger
10211
and when i laughed really hard until it
10213
hurt give me one second i want to get
10215
something here i got a
10217
got a couple these props here um
10221
this is a canadian money this is real
10223
canadian money what we use there that's
10224
i don't know why i picked that up sorry
10226
i got a couple baseball cards um and
10229
these meant the world to me when i was a
10230
kid these are rookie cards for a couple
10232
of great troll blue jays players
10233
whatever
10234
but this here
10236
this here means a lot to me and
10239
what happened and my kids like they have
10241
a love of baseball as well um
10244
and
10246
i want you all to think about one point
10248
in your life when you were so euphoric
10252
so happy and i want you to meditate
10254
about that really think about it
10256
and i want that to be your trigger
10258
for if you ever aren't in the best moods
10261
you're not if you're not in the peak
10262
peak mental state if you're not yourself
10264
if you're not happy
10265
i want you to remember when you were
10266
younger maybe you were family at a game
10269
or something bonding with your dad your
10271
mom your brother sister whatever
10273
your your spouse uh and that should
10276
put you back in that peak mental state
10278
we all have one or two incidents in our
10279
life that we all remember that put us in
10281
that peak mental state um and i wasn't
10283
even planning on talking about this but
10284
i'm gonna wing it this is um
10286
well okay so
10288
this here
10289
um and if you can't see it properly um
10292
then matt what i want you to do is match
10294
my editor he's awesome get the 2016 tops
10297
jose batista card uh number eight and
10300
and this here was um
10302
a game number of years ago uh and my
10305
three boys and i'll show you what my
10306
kids look like actually
10308
um so these are my my three boys this is
10311
um andrew um dylan a little munchkin uh
10316
and he's usually not that quiet
10318
and matthew and they're so different
10320
they're like sons to me i love them to
10321
death
10322
but
10324
i i bring this up because
10326
what happened was we were watching a
10328
baseball game it was 2015.
10331
it was one of the happiest moments of my
10332
life
10333
after i got married and all that good
10334
stuff in case christine's watching yeah
10336
but we were watching the game here it
10338
was in this house and we're upstairs and
10341
we were losing the game to the texas
10343
rangers another baseball team
10344
and this guy named jose batista and this
10347
is a a picture of of what happened
10350
he hit the most
10352
epic home run
10353
and it was a come from behind victory
10355
and then he flipped his bat
10357
and we all like my three boys and me
10360
they have a little brother me we all
10362
jumped up and down up and down up and
10364
down and we're yelling top of our lungs
10366
we were so happy and they were jumping
10367
into my arms and all that stuff and
10369
i was
10370
i was euphoric i was happy
10373
and
10374
whenever i'm not in the best moods i i
10376
think of this situation here and by the
10378
way this this baseball that he hits to
10380
win that game uh i bid on it in an
10383
auction i gotta open it right at the end
10384
killed me but whatever it is what is um
10387
but this is what i think of
10389
this moment right here
10392
and so um
10394
and maybe this camera has got a better
10395
angle i'm not sure with the lighting and
10396
stuff uh but
10398
but that's yeah this is uh
10400
this means the world to me you know my
10402
boys obviously my family and christine
10404
like my parents everybody
10406
and when i'm not in the best of moods uh
10407
what i do
10408
is um and give me one second put this
10411
back here
10412
make sure there's no
10414
glare i don't think there is whoop okay
10416
good glare scott nice when i'm running
10418
out of the best of moods i i think of
10420
this this event
10422
and it gets me back into peak mental
10424
state
10425
you know um
10427
you can snap out of a crappy mood
10430
by
10430
thinking of a trigger point in your life
10433
at one point in your life when you were
10434
you were so euphoric so happy
10437
um and you know just because you're
10439
older now doesn't mean you can't
10441
love the same things that you loved when
10443
you were a lot younger like you like
10445
video games f it play video games
10448
you know you love sports just don't
10449
think of it like it's a business just
10451
remember the times you bonded with
10453
family and friends
10454
over great sporting events and if you
10456
can if you get a chance
10458
you know if they tear down your stadium
10460
that you used to go to whether it's a i
10462
don't know cricket stadium rugby
10464
baseball australian rules football or
10466
whatever it is
10467
see if you can buy that that seat yeah
10469
so anyway um
10472
think about a trigger point if you can't
10474
in your life to get you in that peak
10476
mental state if you ever need uh a
10477
pick-me-up
10479
okay
10480
what i'll do now is i'll go into
10481
high-speed and and i'll get this old
10483
rustic uh piece of not junk out of the
10486
way
10491
all right
10492
let's do this let's do this this will be
10494
a fun class
10495
so again this is uh
10498
e1-3
10501
unjustified criticism
10503
is nothing more than a disguised
10504
compliment so bring it on doubters and
10507
i'm gonna have a bunch of brand new
10508
quotes that you're gonna enjoy i hope
10510
you enjoy them uh and so if if somebody
10512
says something that that
10514
dislodges you or gets you out of your
10516
peak mental state
10518
um
10519
and it's so unjustified i want you do
10521
one of two things
10522
the first thing i want you to do is i
10525
want you to tell yourself
10527
they're probably very envious
10529
for whatever reason
10530
you know and that criticism i don't
10533
choose to accept it
10534
because it's unjustified but you know
10536
what and this is me talking to the jerk
10539
that criticized me or whoever it might
10540
be in the future and you know who i'm
10541
talking about this has all happened to
10543
all of us you know what
10545
i want to thank that jerk
10547
because
10548
he is so insecure
10550
that he gave me a great compliment thank
10553
you bring it on bring it on
10555
and if you're not getting criticized
10557
you're not successful enough it's gonna
10559
happen and i want you to embrace it
10561
because unjustified criticism is nothing
10564
more than a disguised compliment think
10565
about that
10566
also think about um
10568
that trigger point you have in your life
10570
for me it's that jose batista
10574
baseball home run thing that uh got my
10576
kids and i in insanely great mood i gave
10579
him shivers just just thinking about it
10580
right now
10582
so again we're gonna go through uh just
10584
part two of of this book today uh and
10587
there's gonna be plenty of exercises as
10588
well and there's a reason why i have
10591
this stuff here
10592
and there's a reason why i have that
10594
there as well and i've got things that
10596
are really personal to me like i'm
10597
opening up in this episode like this is
10599
my most prized possession
10601
um it was jamaica january of uh of 1980
10606
and and my dad and i
10607
um we went for a walk on the beach in
10610
jamaica and i was uh i was seven at the
10613
time and i remember really well
10615
and
10616
there was a
10617
this was this was dark green when i saw
10619
it initially there's tons of bamboo
10621
uh that was on the ground uh and
10623
somebody cut it up and my dad took it
10624
and he got a keychain
10626
uh and uh while i was swimming in the
10627
pool uh my mom was back in the hotel
10630
room because katie my little baby sister
10631
wasn't feeling all that but my dad
10633
actually carved in here and it says
10635
chris jamaica
10636
uh january 1980 i've used this as a pen
10639
holder whatever i spilled yeah years ago
10641
i don't remember when but um this means
10644
a lot to me so i'm going to open up
10645
today
10646
um
10647
yeah so anyway we're going to do part
10649
two now of this book
10651
yeah so again there's 17 sections in the
10654
book
10654
last class we talked talked about uh
10657
sections one through eight
10659
um and in this class we're gonna discuss
10661
sections um nine through seventeen nine
10663
through seventeen yeah
10665
all right um so
10668
just take notes uh in in today's
10670
workbook please on
10672
how you can apply
10673
every single lesson we talk about as
10675
many as you can
10676
to help to enhance your life make you
10679
happier
10680
improve your career prospects help you
10683
with goal settings et cetera
10685
and so what i did was i made 101 places
10687
for you to write down
10688
uh these uh in in the workbook so
10691
today's workbook we're going through
10692
lessons 43 43 through 101
10695
uh and in the last workbook uh we did uh
10698
1 through 42. so if you haven't watched
10699
the previous lecture please go back and
10701
watch it first okay thank you
10703
all right
10704
let's talk about section number nine
10707
which is called legal stuff is important
10711
and so
10712
lesson number 43 is how to protect your
10715
family
10717
it's really really important
10719
if you ever start a company
10721
or if
10723
you're part of a partnership and you
10725
have equity in a company
10726
that if somebody gives you an employment
10728
contract that you hire a lawyer to get
10730
them to review it
10732
the problem with lawyers is it doesn't
10734
matter
10735
if you really trust the person you're
10736
working for
10738
if they give you a contract to sign
10741
they probably haven't read it their
10742
lawyer made it and their lawyer is
10745
obviously biased
10747
uh and so i really want you to hire a
10749
lawyer on the side to review the legal
10752
document please do that please please
10754
please
10755
um and i've done that before when i've
10757
been part of partnerships and it saved
10759
my ass it really really did
10762
what happened was there was a
10763
stipulation
10764
in the contract that if one of our
10765
companies we invested in venture capital
10767
companies got acquired
10770
or had an exit
10771
or there was a harvesting event meaning
10773
it went public or whatever
10775
that
10776
there was no timeline when i would get
10778
paid but i would get paid one day which
10781
could have meant 50 million years from
10782
now whatever so that that really saved
10784
my backside uh and i actually ended up
10786
selling all my positions whatever
10788
um and
10790
also when when when i've had other like
10793
i in my hedge fund i had 25 of my hedge
10795
fund um i actually had a i sold it to a
10798
high net worth investor that was one of
10800
my my big backers
10802
uh and and i hired a lawyer as well and
10805
the lawyer put in some language to just
10807
to save my backside like all the people
10809
in business i've dealt with they've been
10810
ethical i trust them
10812
but you gotta you gotta watch out uh and
10814
the same thing when it comes to
10816
if you start your own company
10818
once you start generating some revenue
10820
please make sure
10821
that you talk to a lawyer i'm going to
10823
get down my knees now because i want you
10824
i want you to remember this forever can
10826
i make a fool of myself laugh at me ouch
10828
not with me hurts my knees now when i
10829
kneel i'm getting older
10832
please
10833
please please please i'll look at all
10835
three cameras actually please you you
10837
and you
10838
i want you all
10840
to get a lawyer
10842
to create
10843
documents to register your company when
10846

10849
something you want to do for us your
10850
life or you're generating revenue that
10852
sort of thing
10853
it's really important because when you
10855
start getting some success people will
10857
come after you they'll sue you it's
10858
happened to me having me recently
10860

10887
if you're not sure how to do it with
10889
your your boss
10890
if you're given
10892
partnership or whatever in the company
10895
and if it's a really really big company
10897
as long as you don't have power
10899
but um a lot of times you do and when
10901
you approach your boss to talk about
10902
this or whoever it is partner or
10904
whatever just say look i have to i have
10906
to be mindful of my family in case i get
10908
hit by a bus or whatever i want to make
10909
sure taken care of
10911
and anybody with half a heart or half a
10913
brain will understand and sympathize
10915
with you as well okay
10918
all right uh next up is um always
10923
always always
10925
ask
10926
a lawyer for help
10928
if
10929
you're not sure
10931
if an investment opportunity is
10934
legitimate
10935
okay so
10937
if you don't get an investor uh offering
10939
memorandum or an s1 document or whatever
10942
it might be if you can't get access to
10944
that
10944
or if it looks like it's half-assed
10947
and
10948
i want you to get your lawyer to look at
10950
that first okay or at least seek their
10952
counsel and never invest in anything
10953
without legal documents anyway like an
10955
offering memorandum and we've talked a
10957
lot about how to read them how to read
10958
the s ones for example
10960
so make sure you have access that and
10962
don't ever do a big investment yourself
10965
without getting your lawyer to review
10966
the documents anyway just in case
10969
just in case okay so just
10971
always be careful and that's one of the
10973
very few lawyers i love which is um
10975
gandhi i think he's a lawyer right i
10977
think so yeah okay
10979
all right next up staying out of trouble
10982
uh in this digital reality we all know
10984
this that everything is recorded
10986
everything every email is recorded
10989
every snapchat that's right be careful
10991
that every snapchat every tick tock or
10994
whatever video
10995
the video does your platform is
10997
every single one is recorded
10999
every phone call is well
11001
everything
11003
so
11004
obviously not anything unethical but
11005
just be careful just be careful things
11007
can be taken out of context always
11010
always always
11011
in every message that i write
11014
in everything i say on every phone call
11016
i've always been
11018
very careful in case somebody takes it
11020
out of context
11022
always be careful
11024
if you feel like you're being trapped
11025
with an email
11027
don't respond
11029
don't respond
11031
be careful
11032
everything is recorded and when i worked
11035
on wall street
11036
every now and then i'd hear a beep in
11038
the background and that meant that the
11040
call is being recorded by law they had
11041
to do that
11042
and i know for a fact actually i think i
11044
know
11045
that a lot of my calls were recorded by
11048
the fbi
11050
and the sec
11052
i never got caught for anything i never
11053
did anything wrong
11055
but just in case be careful
11057
and i was told actually at a couple
11059
hedge funds i worked at that just
11061
pretend every call is recorded just be
11063
careful
11064
just be careful it's never worth it
11066
cutting corners anyway
11068
it's never worth it never worth it
11069
there's so many celebrities that have
11071
gone to jail
11072
for years
11074
for something as stupid as a buddy
11076
calling said hey i got a stock pick for
11077
you okay thanks okay i'll buy it
11079
whatever
11080
they heard something like martha stewart
11082
etc just be careful okay
11084
assume everything is documented
11088
every every single phone call email etc
11091
i know it sounds a little silly for me
11092
to go on and on and on about this but i
11094
care i care yeah
11096
and if a lawsuit ever does occur
11099
what's going to happen is lawyers will
11101
go through email servers um texts
11104
whatever and they'll find they can find
11106
something like i believe warren buffett
11109
said this if you ever investigate
11110
somebody enough you'll find something
11112
you'll find something
11114
so just be careful yeah
11117
all right next up is i want you to
11119
please go to your workbook
11121
uh and similar to what we did last class

11302
[Music]
11328
welcome back
11330
section number 10
11332
management best practices
11335
the most crucial business revelation is
11338
that ideas are commodities execution is
11341
not it's all about the management team
11343
most people don't realize that most
11345
people think if i have a solid business
11347
model
11348
then everybody will invest and things
11350
will work out that's not the way the
11351
world works
11353
so let's go through these
11355
so lesson number 46 is you want to
11357
praise in public and criticize in
11360
private and this is a great way to
11362
manage people
11363
and i actually got this this idea here
11365
from the former ceo
11367
of a great software company called
11369
splunk splk is the ticker
11372
and godfrey sullivan was the former ceo
11375
of the company and i also invested in
11377
him
11378
when he was the ceo of a great software
11381
company called hyperion that oracle
11382
bought and before that godfrey worked at
11385
apple he has a lot of great experience
11386
and so i'm trying to impress upon the
11388
importance of looking at a great
11389
management team first before investing
11391
now godfrey said one day to me um you
11394
know i asked why are you so successful
11395
and people will do that man it's great
11397
and that's the crux of my whole book
11399
people will do that if you see somebody
11400
successful
11402
um get more successful than you are
11404
right now right now
11406
then i want you to approach them and ask
11408
them for you know just advice ask them
11410
what give me one reason why you're
11411
successful and people love talking about
11413
themselves look at me i i i won't stop
11415
talking i keep talking about myself it's
11417
annoying really
11418
uh but i'm not successful
11420
uh but
11421
so yeah i've met with a ton of people
11423
that are way more successful ever be and
11425
i always ask them for one piece of
11426
advice that's not taught in schools
11428
and that's why i do what i do right now
11430
i'm trying to teach you real practical
11431
based stuff
11433
uh and not theoretical crap
11436
and so godfrey said he likes to praise
11438
in public and only criticize in private
11442
you know there's nothing worse than
11444
being criticized by your boss in front
11446
of many of your i don't know fellow
11448
workmates
11450
um it destroys morale and it makes you
11453
makes you hate your job
11455
so nobody wins
11456
if you're going to critic criticize
11458
somebody uh try to do it in private
11461
always always always and there's right
11462
ways to criticize tim
11464
you know um and there's
11466
i hate to do this uh but i think i'll
11468
talk about it right now um
11471
and i'm gonna tell you about how to
11473
hire and fire people later but
11476
today but when you let somebody go
11479
that what you're supposed to do is this
11481
and they usually know it's coming
11483
you sit down with them and you start off
11486
by and usually do it on a monday if you
11488
want to ruin their weekend
11490
you you start off by saying something
11492
very complimentary
11493
but sincere and real
11495
like everybody on the team
11497
really enjoys your company and you did a
11499
great job on the project x or whatever
11501
it is
11503
however
11504
due to this this and this i'm so sorry
11507
we have to let you go
11508
so you always start with with something
11510
positive and that's extreme because i'm
11512
talking about letting somebody go and
11514
i'll give you more information on how to
11515
do that very very soon
11518
but when you're criticizing somebody uh
11520
that you want to keep
11521
um you want to start off and be
11523
complimentary at first yeah yeah it's
11526
more subtle that way and it'll take it
11527
better as well yeah
11530
all right um next up is be unemotional
11534
in business that's that's the incredible
11535
hulk there
11536
um
11538
so
11540
and i've mentioned this before
11542
that a lot of the best investors i've
11544
worked for a lot of billionaires and i
11546
won't say which ones ever
11548
but some of them it feels like they were
11549
borderline aspergers um
11552
and they were unemotional
11554
and i think that's one of the reasons
11555
why they're very successful
11557
but you can train yourself to sort of be
11559
like that you got to check your emotions
11561
at the door
11562
and never get too emotional in business
11564
and remember warren buffett
11566
said the new york stock exchange
11568
is the only store in the world where
11569
consumers sell stuff and it goes on sale
11572
i want you to be unemotional
11574
and i'm a very positive person however
11578
when things go incredibly well for you i
11580
don't want you to high-five and throw a
11583
big party et cetera unless it's a
11585
massive milestone whatever in business
11587
i want you stay level-headed
11590
and you got to stay level-headed because
11592
if the opposite happens
11594
you'll freak out
11596
check your emotions at the door
11599
be unemotional about business always
11601
always always
11603
uh and you can condition yourself to do
11605
that too
11606
like when i come home from work i
11608
condition myself so that when i touch
11610
the front door
11611
and start to turn it
11614
i leave all my stress and thoughts about
11616
work at work
11618
inside my house it's a sacred temple my
11621
kids christine my kids and i my family
11625
but i conditioned myself that way and
11626
you can condition yourself as well to
11628
check your emotions at the door
11630
when you show up to work even so you're
11631
not emotional especially when it comes
11633
to finance
11634
yeah
11636
all right next up is the most important
11639
investment characteristic which you can
11641
probably guess here
11642
has to do with horses
11645
the jockey me and the dude on top of the
11647
horse the jockey is more important than
11649
the horse and what that means is
11651
the management team or the founder or
11654
founders they're more important than the
11655
business model the horse is the business
11657
model in this analogy
11658
okay always remember that always always
11661
always and
11662
when you assess a management team
11664
um make sure that they get you excited
11668
about the vision they paint for you so
11670
to speak or the dream they're selling to
11672
you
11673
because
11674
the business model will change if it's
11676
an early stage company
11678
but i want you to be incredibly
11680
passionate because the potential
11682
investor
11683
that's watching you present
11686
they're thinking themselves
11687
does this person get me excited deep
11689
down in my belly
11691
about this business opportunity
11694
and i know
11696
that that business opportunity that the
11697
market will probably change one day but
11699
i want to know that this this this
11701
person that's trying to sell me the idea
11703
will be able to sell me on another idea
11706
or be able to adapt and get me excited
11708
about another
11710
business model or whatever it might be
11712
or new product they might be offering a
11713
new service
11714
if i invest if i invest
11717
and as mark cuban said
11719
ideas are commodities by execution is
11721
not
11722
and mark cuban is is the dude that
11724
he sold um broadcast.com
11727
uh to youtube for or pardon me to yahoo
11730
for several billion dollars in the late
11732
90s and
11735
that could have been youtube actually
11736
but it wasn't they messed up the
11738
acquisition
11739
but mark cuban also said
11741
you only have to be right in business
11744
one time
11745
so just remember that when you keep
11747
trying to write different business plans
11749
if you fail a couple times
11751
so what
11752
you will be successful eventually and i
11754
don't have to read you that that quote
11756
on the wall uh with michael jordan there
11758
yeah you get it
11760
okay next up we've got um yeah hire
11764
slowly and and fire quickly so
11768
when you hire somebody
11770
the best way to do it is to
11773
really over interview
11775
um and so
11776
like when i worked at goldman sachs like
11778
the smartest people in the world didn't
11780
work there i mean they hired me
11781
but they they hired people that really
11783
got along well
11786
and we had to go through a gazillion
11788
interviews a ton of them like 40
11790
sometimes 40 or 50. it was nuts
11792
but the jerk factor is very very low
11795
and they took their time thank god
11797
because
11797
one stupid
11799
or one employee with with a bad attitude
11802
i should say can destroy
11804
an entire company it's true you've all
11807
been doing you've done group projects in
11809
school or at work where there's one jerk
11812
that just destroys everything it's not
11814
worth it it's not worth it so when you
11816
interview people i want you to make sure
11819
that they are interviewed multiple times
11821
in different settings
11823
under different amounts of pressure and
11824
i say with love my heart
11826
so interview them maybe at a breakfast
11828
meeting
11829
uh do a two-on-one lunch meeting uh have
11832
them present to five or six people in
11834
your company if you have that many
11835
people
11835
um you know go out maybe for dinner with
11838
them and their spouse
11839
um and see them in all aspects of their
11841
life
11842
because they can't act the whole time
11845
you know if if they're the salty earth
11846
they're good people
11848
um you'll know you'll know and usually i
11850
know within 30 seconds
11852
um whether or not i trust them and go
11854
with your gut too
11856
because you learn
11858
by by you know by through business over
11861
over many decades
11862
that your gut is often right and we've
11865
all gotten burned in our personal lives
11867
and professional lives too
11869
and we end up telling ourselves you know
11871
fool me once shame on you fool me twice
11874
shame on me go with your gut go with
11876
your gut because a lot of times you're
11879
when you get screwed over in business or
11881
personally speaking when you're younger
11883
remember when you broke your heart the
11884
first time it hurt and it never hurt
11886
that bad again right you kind of learn
11888
you kind of learn um and and in
11891
hindsight after you get screwed over in
11892
business or personally you tell yourself
11894
damn it i knew
11896
i knew
11897
go with your gut go with your gut but
11899
take a long time to hire people and when
11902
you're interviewing people
11903
make sure
11905
that
11906
you feel it in your heart
11908
that they're not interviewing for a job
11910
they're interviewing for a passion
11912
okay and they'll be way more productive
11914
that way trust me on this
11916
the difference between hiring an average
11919
engineer and an incredible engineer
11922
is 10 times more in performance
11927
and a lot of engineers actually they
11928
love what they do you know they just
11930
they're they're they're nerds they they
11932
love they grew up like like i did you
11933
know playing video games
11935
i was gonna include this i don't know i
11937
guess i didn't but this was uh
11939
i guess this is the the first um
11941
joystick i had for my um this is the
11944
apple
11945
predecessor that with the apple 2e
11947
actually but a lot of a lot of people
11948
that are engineers and nice to be a
11950
software engineer too
11951
we grew up loving it like these are some
11953
of the programs that i i you know i
11955
developed for microsoft and other stuff
11957
too but i loved it man it was fun
11960
you know and that's why a lot of
11961
technology companies do well
11963
because the people are so passionate
11965
about what they're doing
11966
they just love it
11968
so make sure that whoever you're
11969
interviewing
11971
is just as passionate as you are
11974
they've got to love it they've got to
11975
absolutely love it
11977
otherwise if it feels like a job then
11980
you'll you'll never put your dent in the
11981
universe as a company
11984
all right oh actually let me let me go
11985
back here um
11987
yeah so higher slowly and fire quickly
11991
um let me talk a little bit more about
11994
um about firing i i talked about it
11996
briefly and i remember the first time i
11998
had to fire somebody it was it was hell
12000
and obviously it was way harder for the
12002
person that i let go
12004
and i didn't know what the hell to do
12006
and i was nervous
12008
and and it sounds stupid for me saying
12010
this because it sucks that i'd let the
12012
other person go but you have to do it
12015
and so what i did was i called um one of
12017
my good friends i went to mcgill with a
12019
guy named mike ball
12021
he was my fraternity too great guy
12023
and and i asked him because his dad was
12026
the head of hr uh human resources at att
12029
or ncr for years
12031
and i asked him how do i do it
12034
and and he helped me out with some
12036
advice and and i took what he told me
12038
and a bunch of other
12040
top silicon valley entrepreneurs i ask
12042
their feedback i always over prepare for
12044
everything
12045
and here's the greatest it's what i
12046
learned
12048
when you let somebody go
12050
you do it on a monday like i mentioned
12051
before you sit down with them
12054
and what you do is this
12056
a bit repetitive here i'm sorry but i
12058
have to do it
12060
you start off by saying something
12062
genuinely nice
12065
and you do it like this
12068
john
12071
i just want to let you know that we
12073
really appreciate
12075
the great job you've done on the x
12077
project making that up
12079
and you know
12080
everybody loves you here and you know
12082
times are tough
12084
but due to the the fact that and then
12086
this is where you mentioned what they
12088
did wrong
12089
that you missed your i'm gonna make it
12090
up you missed your quota
12092
three quarters in a row
12094
we have to let you go
12097
then you pause and you say nothing
12101
you pause
12102
and dude it feels like freaking eternity
12105
just waiting sometimes
12106
you say nothing
12109
and then they'll
12111
they'll say something
12113
um
12114
a lot of times they'll know like they'll
12116
kind of they figure it out it's
12117
happening you know
12119
like when they're they're called into
12120
the meeting on a monday
12122
they know they know or at least they
12124
have a hunch and they probably know it's
12126
coming because they haven't been
12127
performing as well it's usually not a
12129
massive surprise sometimes it is
12132
and then you just wait
12134
and they might say something rightly so
12137
about you know what about my family and
12139
that sort of thing and then you you have
12141
a file there
12143
and you say well we prepared for you uh
12145
these these benefits uh and you wanna be
12147
very generous of course
12149
and if it's a bigger company you'll have
12151
somebody from human resources
12153
in the room as well
12156
and if you don't know what to do and
12158
it's a tiny company it's just you and
12160
somebody else or a couple people you can
12162
always get a lawyer to help you call
12164
them and ask them how do i do this you
12166
have to do it the right way
12168
and
12170
then what happens and most of the time
12171
people are cool about it but i've been
12173
in situations where
12175
a colleague of mine was let go
12177
and they had to call security
12181
and you can always get a security guard
12184
uh you can you can
12186
hire one
12187
or you can get somebody in a bigger
12189
company uh to be standing by
12192
just outside the room just in case just
12194
in case
12195
and if they're a bit abrasive uh or you
12197
know the person that you let go
12199
um
12201
you can always say
12203
and you could be firm you know if
12204
they're being really pushy you could say
12207
do i have to call security
12210
like that like that so anyway and then
12213
what happens usually is they
12215
they look at the paperwork quickly and
12217
and then they they shake your hand
12219
that's it
12220
yeah
12221
yeah
12223
and you got to be careful too because if
12224
you let go and it's happened to
12226
everybody happen to me
12228
um if you're let go
12230
if you're not careful
12233
and if if you're abrasive or a jerk well
12236
first of all you're gonna make it easier
12237
for them to let you go
12239
but if you're a jerk about it
12241
good luck getting another job
12244
because that's your reference whoever
12245
lets you go is your former boss
12248
that's your reference
12249
so be good about it like when i was let
12251
go
12252
i didn't like
12254
my boss he put his hand out
12256
uh and
12258
i didn't shake it i gave him a hug
12261
and i hugged him so hard i broke
12263
all his ribs no i'm just kidding i'm
12264
just kidding
12265
it was bogus um
12267
i i made the firm money i have no idea
12270
what happened but i was strategic um i
12272
think he was threatened by me but it is
12274
what it is
12275
but i'm so glad it happened because in
12276
hindsight many many many many years
12278
later i look back i'm like thank you god
12280
for guiding me down that path a
12282
different path
12284
sometimes you won't understand in life
12286
why things happen and then years later
12288
you look back and you'll say
12290
you know what as painful as that was
12292
professionally for me it was the best
12294
thing that could have happened to me
12295
because it forced me down this path here
12300
so um but just yeah be careful on your
12302
way out and and
12305
if any of you have left a company
12308
and
12309
you didn't live on leave on great terms
12311
and somebody asked for a reference
12313
you don't have to get your old boss as a
12315
reference you can always have a former
12317
colleague
12318
a buddy of yours who can even write a
12320
nice recommendation on linkedin
12323
so that's just food for thought yeah uh
12326
and when you let people go you gotta
12329
you gotta let them go fast
12332
it's so hard
12334
and after you let them go say you wait
12336
six months too long
12338
after you let them go you're like damn
12339
it they hurt productivity i should let
12341
them go way way before way way way way
12343
earlier it's so hard though man it's
12345
i've got a big heart
12347
um but at the same time you got to put
12349
business first
12351
and if it if it ever
12353
if your heart gets in the way of
12355
business sometimes just think to
12356
yourself this is all things to say but i
12358
have to
12359
you're hurting your family if you don't
12360
do it sooner
12362
and you're hurting them as well because
12364
they're rotting away at work
12366
when they could be doing something else
12368
they're more passionate about
12370
and i know it doesn't make sense to a
12372
lot of us right now
12373
but many years later you'll look back
12376
and
12377
you might be glad
12378
that you were let go yeah
12384
all right
12388
okay next up um we've got touch hand
12392
only once
12394
um i didn't know what icon to use here
12396
what graphics so
12397
i found like an old file cabinet thing
12400
because
12401
i got this one from my dad
12403
and this is old school device it's great
12405
though
12406
he said
12408
if you ever
12411
if you ever write a letter
12413
and
12414
you're a little bit negative in the
12415
letter
12417
or mean by accident or whatever it is
12419
and if you're emotional
12422
don't mail that letter yet
12424
take that letter my dad he's he's arabic
12426
from egypt he'd say take the letter put
12429
it in the drawer
12431
and then i can't do his accent well i'm
12433
sorry but
12434
open it the next day the drawer next
12436
morning after you sleep on it and if you
12438
still feel the same way after you read
12439
it then send it
12441
and that's great advice it's great
12442
advice because
12444
in this digital reality now
12447
um
12449
you could send an email when you're in a
12451
crap mood
12453
and
12454
destroy your life
12455
or hurt your career a lot
12457
and what i used to do is i used to have
12458
christine who's my wife and my shrink
12460
and my wife and my shrink
12463
um she um i used to ever read some of my
12465
emails i'm like did i sound
12467
how's the tone here that sort of thing
12469
because things can be really
12470
misinterpreted you know like if somebody
12472
types in all caps which i never do but
12474
it's like they're yelling and usually
12476
with almost all my emails since day one
12479
i use the word please and thank you and
12481
all it's just on my birth thanks
12483
something i've always done yeah
12486
touch hand only once
12488
yeah yeah oh my god i think i screwed
12490
that up but screw it let me go back
12492
there
12493
i meant to say something else there but
12495
that was good advice screw it we'll keep
12496
that in there it's fine
12498
touch hand only once i'm such an idiot
12501
it's an old school business thing which
12503
is this in the old days you used to get
12505
inter-office memos and there's a string
12507
on it you unwrap open the envelope
12509
and the best business people in the
12510
world will say
12512
when a memo comes in your hand or an
12514
email or whatever it is
12516
only let it touch your hand one time
12520
and take care of everything right away
12521
if you can unless it's something that's
12523
gonna take forever to do and i've
12525
adopted that actually in many aspects of
12526
my life
12528
and this is gonna sound out there but it
12529
saves me time
12531
when i make a salad at night and i love
12534
salad with oil and vinegar and salt and
12536
pepper and i have this awesome uh bagel
12539
spice it's it's it's it's what you put
12541
on everything bagels but it's a spice i
12542
get it from trader joe's the best ever
12546
but i only let all those things touch my
12547
hand once so i open the cupboard up once
12550
and i take all those out at the same
12551
time once
12553
you put them all back in at once right i
12555
know it sounds silly
12557
but if you use that mentality you will
12559
save a ton of time a ton of time
12562
so
12563
touch hand only once
12565
okay
12567
all right so now i want you to please go
12569
to your workbook
12571
and click on number 10 meaning section
12574
10
12575
on the front page
12576
and then i want you to take three
12577
minutes please
12579
and write down notes on how you can
12581
apply the lessons in section 10 to
12584
enhance your career or make you happier
12586
you've got three minutes go
12596
[Music]
12623
[Music]
12636
do
12640
[Music]
12661
[Music]
12679
[Music]
12699
[Music]
12721
do
12722
[Music]
12738
[Music]
12765
all right let's move on now to section
12767
number 11
12769
which is called navigating corporate
12770
politics and swimming with sharks yeah
12775
all right
12776
so
12777
the first one here is keep that letter
12780
in your drawer i i i'm such an idiot i
12783
jumped the gun i already talked about
12785
this one so i'm just gonna skip it okay
12786
but just keep in mind that
12788
a lot of times in business
12791
you don't get to the next level because
12793
of politics which sucks and i'm going to
12795
give you some i guess some some tips
12797
here
12798
on how to um
12800
how to swim with the shark so to speak
12802
as much as i hate that
12804
so
12805
religion and politics
12807
leave them at home
12809
don't ever talk about them in work ever
12812
ever ever
12813
because the way that politics works
12816
usually in most countries there's two
12817
parties
12818
party one or party two you know or
12821
sometimes there's three like in canada
12823
there's there's a bunch actually there's
12825
progressive conservative which is like
12826
right wing relatively speaking
12828
you got liberals and then you've got um
12831
ndp
12832
which i can't stand i mean ndp yeah
12835
which is uh
12836
they're more socialist yeah yeah
12838
sorry about that sort of
12841
and in america you've got republicans
12844
and democrats and republicans means that
12846
you're more right-wing and democrats
12848
means that you're less right-wing you're
12849
more left-wing
12851
and i live here in california on the
12852
left coast
12854
get myself in trouble there i gotta be
12855
careful
12856
but
12857
if you tell people what your political
12859
affiliation is and i think i'm probably
12861
a libertarian i believe in the power of
12863
the individual and that you can
12865
accomplish anything so i'm less so
12867
married to these parties although i will
12869
swap every now and then okay
12872
but if you tell somebody that you're in
12874
one part you like one type of politician
12878
then half the people will hate you or
12880
not like you as much i don't know what
12881
half
12882
but just be careful it's not worth it so
12884
what do you do when politics come up at
12886
work
12888
well you just
12890
don't talk
12892
if a bunch of people are around
12894
or if somebody tries to bait you into it
12896
you can say two words
12898
i understand
12900
and that won't let them know that you're
12903
one with one party or the other party i
12905
i understand that will help
12907
uh and religion is is is tough it's
12910
tough um
12911
it's really really hard because i am
12913
really passionate about stuff but
12915
and i'm
12916
i'm very respectful of every religion on
12918
the planet
12920
but just be careful at class or at uh at
12923
um at work getting nervous now yeah yeah
12926
just be careful yeah
12929
all right next up is um unjustified
12932
criticism is a disguised compliment i
12935
had to mention this one twice okay and
12936
so yeah if somebody
12938
criticizes you unfairly you got to tell
12940
yourself
12942
thanks man
12944
like don't say it out loud it'll drive
12946
them nuts
12947
um
12949
don't say it out loud it'll it won't
12951
help you
12953
but just tell that to yourself and your
12955
mind and that will say it is
12957
yeah
12958
yeah so remember that
12961
unjustify and write it down please write
12964
it down
12965
unjustified criticism is a disguised
12967
compliment
12968
that will add years to your life it'll
12970
take away a lot of stress in your heart
12973
and your mind as well
12974
yeah
12976
all right um what do we have next number
12979
number 54.
12981
come on slides move faster there we go
12983
good all right next one is um how to
12986
talk buying people's backs
12988
and that's um
12989
looks like a nail file but i it's it's
12992
actually a butter knife um
12994
i didn't want to have a real real knife
12996
whatever but the best way is not to do
12998
it at all i know it sounds silly and
13000
you're like chris seriously like i'm an
13001
adult here right i know
13004
but don't get tied into that like office
13007
gossip like stay away from gossip at the
13009
office
13010
um
13012
like sometimes it's you're around the
13014
water cooler and somebody will be
13015
gossiping you're like yeah yeah you're
13017
interested in hearing it
13019
but just don't don't be a part of that
13021
people won't trust you and if you gossip
13023
even a little bit about somebody at work
13025
they'll appreciate hearing it
13027
but they won't trust you
13029
you know it's like somebody that
13030
backstabs their wife or their husband
13032
you know says something bad about them
13034
um you're like dude i can never trust
13036
you
13038
so stay away from gossip at work it's
13042
not worth it it's not worth it at all
13044
yeah
13046
all right next up is
13048
observe and then make your move
13050
so every company has a slightly
13052
different corporate culture and every
13053
team does
13054
and every board does as well
13057
so when you join a new company
13060
i don't want you to make your move right
13063
away and try to really impress people
13064
right away
13065
hear me out
13067
i want you to question things at first
13069
like question in your mind
13071
and really observe how the system works
13074
because every company's a little bit
13075
different
13076
you know
13077
and be nice to the assistants please
13080
anybody that isn't is an
13082
plus the assistants have been there
13083
longer than most people and they
13085
probably worked with their boss at the
13087
previous company as well and they know
13088
how to get stuff done
13090
and if you confide in them
13092
and get them to mentor you they'll love
13094
it
13094
they'll trust you you'll trust them and
13096
they'll help you with your career
13098
yeah yeah you can really
13101
you can really understand what kind of a
13102
person somebody is or how much jerk they
13104
are by how they treat assistance
13107
so observe
13108
observe how the system works at first
13110
before making your move you got one shot
13112
to really impress people just sit back a
13114
bit don't be lazy
13116
but don't talk up too much initially
13118
just observe how it works you know
13120
quietly
13121
observe the system because every com
13124
every company is is a little bit
13125
different a little bit different yeah
13129
all right next up is the army promotes
13131
you because of this um so
13135
it's so hard sometimes to to deal with
13138
authority and
13140
not talk back and just do what you're
13142
told to do and
13144
but sometimes if you
13146
if you kind of follow blindly i hate to
13149
say
13150
sometimes it helps you with your career
13152
a lot uh and you might be frustrated but
13154
it in the long run it'll it'll pay off
13156
because you'll get what you want and if
13157
you're frustrated enough you can leave
13158
anyway but the biggest thing here is
13160
that
13162
when i used to work in consultant
13165
it was kind of like the army
13167
you know it's when there's a war the
13169
troops go and fight where the war is
13171
if you're a consultant
13173
you're sent wherever the client is
13175
wherever all the any any it might be a
13177
different country and i've been all over
13178
the place doing that many countries
13180
and
13182
there's actually um
13184
there's a guy who who used to be the
13186
co-chairman of goldman sachs
13189
and he actually came and lectured at
13191
columbia university
13193
uh and i think his name was uh was was
13196
stephen levitt i think yeah
13198
um actually i gotta go find out right
13200
now because his son actually is the guy
13202
that wrote game of thrones
13204
let me let me go here here sorry i i
13206
have to find out right now
13207
uh but but i remember he was there and i
13211
was in new york and i was about to join
13214
goldman and goldman wanted me to start
13216
my career in tokyo
13217
and and i didn't want to go
13219
and so what i did um
13223
hold on a second bend the office guy's
13224
last name i'll talk about this guys
13226
what i did was it was i said to him i'll
13228
get that second
13230
i said do i really have to go
13232
and he stared me down in front of
13234
everybody there's like 60 people in the
13235
class said
13237
yes you do
13239
so if you want to get promoted to a
13240
senior senior level in companies
13242
sometimes you have to move if they tell
13244
you to move it sucks
13246
uh but but if you do that you take one
13248
for the team
13249
but don't go
13251
unless you get something promised in
13252
return
13254
you know basically say i'll go but i
13256
want to make sure i get promoted
13258
and you can hold up you can kind of use
13260
that card and they'll promote you as
13262
they send you
13264
um but this guy's name um
13266
the guy that wrote like game of thrones
13268
uh he um okay so he was the the
13270
screenwriter david benioff
13273
and his dad was a professor steven
13275
somebody i gotta know because he changed
13276
his last name benioff yeah steven
13278
friedman it was steven friedman yeah
13280
yeah he changed his last name from
13282
benioff to friedman because there's lots
13283
of david friedman that are writers but
13286
that's his dad yeah his dad was um
13288
goldman sachs where is he getting here
13290
now now i'm curious stephen friedman
13293
that's right here is the guy this is the
13295
guy that that stared me down yeah yeah
13297
then eventually he went into government
13299
because
13300
at goldman sachs i worked at goldman for
13301
years and i understand after i left why
13303
so many successful politicians from
13305
goldman sachs er come out of uh by so
13308
many successful politicians come out of
13309
goldman sachs yeah yeah it's tough place
13311
to work but it's fun too i'm proud it's
13313
on my resume and again they don't have
13315
the smartest people in the world
13317
way off track okay anyway
13320
next up
13322
mr bean
13324
uh facetime is important i hate it
13327
you know but but early on your career
13329
when you're first starting out
13331
you got to be first in
13332
and you got to be last out
13334
okay it's something i i call philo first
13336
and last out
13338
it sucks and hopefully you don't have
13340
kids and
13341
all that stuff um when you first start
13344
your career
13345
but but it's important it's important um
13348
i hate it i hate it but it's important
13350
face time is important and michael
13352
bloomberg who started he's a billionaire
13354
he started bloomberg and he was mayor of
13356
new york whatever for a while that's
13358
what he did early in his career
13360
he would show up for anybody
13362
and um
13363
yeah that that's base time was important
13365
i got that one from him actually yeah
13367
he's done quite well
13369
all right next up is dta which stands
13372
for don't trust anyone
13375
sharks are tough to spot sometimes it's
13378
so true it's so true
13380
um
13382
usu when you go with your gut usually
13383
you can tell somebody's a shark but
13385
sometimes you don't know like if push
13387
comes to shove
13388
and you're competing with somebody get
13389
promoted at work
13391
um
13392
don't trust them man
13394
don't trust anyone like just be really
13396
really careful
13397
like don't date anybody at work either
13399
ever unless you're sure it's uh if
13400
you're positive this is the one this is
13402
the one yeah just be careful dta don't
13405
trust anyone okay
13406
and i debated whether i include this one
13408
or not and actually in my book i renamed
13410
this chapter it was it was chapter 59 in
13412
the paperback version and the kindle
13414
version
13415
um and i actually changed the title
13417
because i angered people then i'm
13419
including it now so it's good i don't
13420
care
13421
so um
13423
a valuable lesson about donald trump
13426
so
13428
and when i wrote this book is before
13429
trump got elected but but years ago i i
13432
read i read
13433
a book from trump called uh the art of
13436
the deal and this guy can get a deal
13437
done
13438
he can't nice let's be intellectually
13440
honest he can't especially in business
13443
but he said something um
13445
years ago that made a lot of sense and
13447
when i first heard it i thought oh my
13448
god that's
13450
i don't know if i agree but he said
13452
you have to remind people
13455
of your accomplishments
13456
otherwise you'll never reach
13458
you know your
13459
highest your potential in life
13463
and as a canadian you know growing up
13465
we're very humble whatever it just
13467
wasn't our nature
13468
you know um
13471
you know wayne gretzky used to say
13474
when when
13475
when you when you lose say nothing
13478
when you win say even less
13481
but but trump is right trump is right um
13484
if you don't remind people of of your
13485
accomplishments you'll never get
13486
promoted
13487
uh you'll never get you'll never be able
13489
to raise money
13491
you'll never get customers you got to
13493
remind people and and sometimes it's as
13495
simple as you're trying to get a big
13496
contract
13497
in your sales person
13499
you have to remind the person that
13501
you're meeting with after you bond
13504
which other big contracts you've signed
13506
in the past big reference customers if
13509
you're allowed to disclose it
13511
and you have to brag about your
13512
accomplishments as well
13514
um and there's ways to do it like
13517
i'm going to brag in a second
13520
and and you'll see how i'm going to brag
13522
and it won't come across as as being a
13524
big brag here we go oh my god i talk a
13526
lot
13529
i'm humbled to say
13531
that i think
13532
that i'm a very good judging character
13535
so you i i through the beginning part
13537
and i'm humbled to say that you know
13538
whatever uh but yeah and trump certainly
13541
doesn't do it that way
13543
uh but if you don't um
13545
if you don't remind people your
13546
accomplishments you'll never get a
13547
promotion
13548
you won't
13549
you'll never get a raise you'll let you
13551
never get a job you'll never get
13552
anything in life
13553
you have to do it you have to it's going
13555
to be humble but at times you have to
13557
brag it's a do or die mentality
13562
okay
13563
uh and and yeah here um ask often how am
13566
i doing how am i doing and i got this
13568
one from another goldman sachs partner
13570
that i met with
13572
when i was at coleman you have to ask
13574
how am i doing often not all the time
13576
but every month or two
13579
meet with your manager and ask her him
13581
you know okay you know i really enjoy
13583
being here at the hermitage or whatever
13586
you know what i mean
13588
i'd love you can please provide me some
13589
feedback on on how i can contribute more
13591
to the team
13592
even more at the time
13595
and they'll start off by saying positive
13598
things if they're a good manager and
13599
then they'll tell you additional things
13601
that you can do
13603
and you can even ask them was it you
13605
know to get promoted to the next level
13608
like what else do i need to do what else
13610
do i need to do
13611
and they'll tell you and once you
13613
accomplish that stuff remind them
13615
when they're in a good mood it's kind of
13617
like asking mom and dad for something
13618
only when they're in a good mood remind
13620
them that when you've accomplished those
13621
things so you can get that promotion
13623
but you have to ask how i'm doing often
13625
and if you do that you'll most likely
13627
never get fired or at least surprised uh
13630
and fired yeah always ask for feedback
13633
otherwise
13634
you just don't know how good of a job
13636
you're doing
13640
all right um and the only way to get
13642
promoted or a raise
13644
and i was looking for the energizer
13646
bunny i couldn't find it so i threw the
13647
durabell
13648
duracell battery in which takes a
13650
licking and keeps on ticking that's what
13652
they used to say i think so or is that
13654
time asked can't remember
13656
uh but the bottom line is you just got
13658
to be relentless you got to be
13659
relentless and
13661
ask over and over and over and over and
13663
over and over again to get a raise or
13666
promotion and there's tactful ways to do
13668
it too and you don't have to be annoying
13670
about it
13671
um or piss off your manager
13673
you meet with them every couple months
13674
and when you ask how am i doing
13676
that's when you ask
13678
you know it and maybe you strike when
13680
they aaron's hot when you achieved a
13681
milestone and they give you great
13683
feedback
13684
then you you say awesome awesome
13686
do you have time for coffee now
13688
and you go for coffee uh and you'll say
13691
thank you very much for the kaufman i
13692
appreciate it it's it's been great being
13694
a member of this team and together we've
13696
accomplished a lot
13697
you know what i'm doing here right
13699
so that then you say well i'd love to
13701
ask you if it's okay
13704
what do i need to do and it's really
13706
making this it's really expensive living
13709
um here with the family and whatnot as
13711
you know and i have to provide and so
13712
i'm
13713
i'd love to ask you please
13716
what do i need to accomplish how much
13718
more how much about more value can i add
13720
and what kind of value can i add to the
13722
team
13723
in order to get a raise or a promotion
13726
and and they'll give you the criteria
13729
and the second you achieve those
13731
criteria
13733
and your boss is in a good mood and it's
13735
not too busy crazy at work
13738
it's a slow day meet with them and ask
13741
otherwise you won't get it you won't get
13743
it
13744
people that make ceo are ones that have
13746
asked that have asked many times to be
13748
promoted and many times for a race
13751
they're sales people they're selling
13752
themselves they're relentless
13755
and they brag as well about their
13756
accomplishments tactfully tactfully
13760
if you don't remind people of your
13761
accomplishments
13762
and if you don't ask for a raise or
13764
promotion
13765
you'll never get it you'll never get it
13768
it's kind of like when you were younger
13770
and you were in school
13772
you kept your head down
13774
and when
13777
when you did well in a test
13779
you were congratulated your parents are
13781
happy teachers are happy everyone's
13783
happy you were happy
13785
then you graduate and you start working
13788
and you keep your head down and you work
13790
hard and you do well
13792
and you think to yourself well
13794
somebody's going to notice me just like
13796
in school
13797
and then you look around you're like
13799
dude why are these people getting
13800
promoted instead of me i accomplished so
13802
much more than they did
13803
oh my gosh that guy got a big raise i
13805
didn't what's up with that
13807
it's because they asked
13809
so you gotta ask
13812
all right um next up is uh there is a
13815
plan b uh before you quit
13818
uh and that's by the way it's an
13820
american power conversion uh older
13823
backup battery i've got four of them
13824
here uh running just in case because i
13826
blew a fuse once or twice because of all
13829
this equipment and lights and stuff in
13830
the air conditioning too
13832
but i put it there because
13834
before you quit
13836
let's say you got a job a job offer from
13838
another company for more money and a
13839
better position whatever
13842
whoa that scared me
13845
sorry that was my alarm that remind me
13847
to put the kids to bed but there's no
13849
school tomorrow so it's fine we're good
13850
we're good
13851
um
13852
sorry about that
13854
so before you quit
13857
think to yourself why are you quitting
13859
you're probably quitting because this
13861
other
13862
company is paying you more money or this
13864
other company is giving you
13866
responsibilities that you enjoy more or
13868
this other company
13869
is giving you a different type of role
13871
in a different geographical location
13873
whatever it is
13874
you got nothing to lose
13876
so when when you go to tell your manager
13878
that you're resigning
13880
um just let them know that you've you've
13882
been offered a job
13885
and
13886
before quitting
13889
there's nothing wrong with asking them
13891
if they could
13893
match that offer
13895
or find you that other role internally
13897
so you can transfer
13899
you got nothing to lose nothing to lose
13901
and everything to gain
13903
okay
13904
uh next up is avoid this at all costs
13909
okay and duff beer what is duff beer
13911
from
13912
you got to tell you what duff beer is
13914
from um
13915
it's a great cartoon that i've been
13917
watching since the 80s and i can't
13919
believe it's still on
13920
uh and i'll tell you what it is in a
13922
minute if you don't already know
13924
and conan o'brien used to be one of the
13925
writers
13927
okay but i want you to avoid alcohol at
13928
all costs um at all events right and i i
13932
used to drink i don't drink anymore and
13933
not judging anybody it's fun
13935
but i want you to be careful and what my
13938
what my my grandfather god bless him he
13941
gave me advice as well
13943
um when i was going to my first job i
13945
asked him i asked a ton of people for
13946
advice and he said to me he said chi chi
13949
christie
13951
when you go to a corporate party
13953
if if you're forced to drink just take
13955
that drink whatever just i don't know
13956
when no one's looking throwing the
13957
plants
13958
yeah and i thought i'm not going to do
13960
that he said or what you can also do
13962
is just get a 7-up with lime in it or
13966
sprite with lime in it because that
13968
looks like a gin and tonic or something
13969
anyway
13970
just be careful with alcohol at work
13972
it's it's so weird because i used to go
13974
out and party whatever and i worked at
13976
hedge fund industry in different
13977
companies i had a blast like i have no
13979
regrets
13980
but a lot of people they let their guard
13983
down right and a lot of these rules i've
13986
taught you today are humble lessons
13987
whatever like don't trust anyone
13989
whatever
13990
all that stuff like
13992
dude people people let their cards down
13994
when they drink at corporate events
13996
um and
13997
you know let them fall in their knives
13999
so to speak for their swords that was
14001
nothing to say but you know what i'm
14002
getting at i'd rather
14004
i'd rather you rise to the top
14006
um yeah
14008
so anyway
14010
that took me a while to create there
14012
there you go now you know where it's
14013
from now you know where it's from that
14014
that's that's uh mr burns
14017
uh front from the simpsons uh and he had
14019
this guy named smithers that worked for
14021
him and i remember one episode he said
14023
mr burns i love you
14025
in that shirt
14026
that's funny
14028
so number 64. and i couldn't get the
14030
eyes to work i don't know why so i just
14031
threw silver everywhere and had to
14033
recolor it but
14034
um
14035
number 64 is
14037
don't ever go over your boss's head
14039
um
14040
unless you have to and i'll explain what
14042
that means so
14045
don't ever talk to your boss's boss
14048
like you can say hello good morning
14049
whatever it is
14050
but just be careful just be careful uh
14053
and i've done it before just
14055
naively trying to help and i've added a
14057
ton of value
14058
and then my boss got jealous and
14062
yeah it happens
14064
just be careful
14066
however
14070
if you think you're going to be let go
14073
or if you work for a jerk
14075

14081
tremendous amount of

14091
hedge fund

14094
the owner of the hedge fund that i was
14096

14110
even though i've been for a heck of a
14111
lot more money i just can't it's not me

14136
an intellectual name
14138
my uncle who worked at general uh
14140
electric um
14143
i remember asking him when i was like
14145
what was i was 22 when i went to
14146
accenture in 94. yeah
14149
i remember asking for advice
14151
and and he said to me he said something
14153
i never understood
14157
he said
14158
well he said also don't ever date
14159
anybody at work um he was right about
14162
that unless it's a sure thing because he
14164
said you'll get fired or they'll get
14165
fired or both whatever
14167
it's yeah
14169
but he said to me something i didn't
14170
understand he said chris just be a nice
14172
dumb guy
14175
i was like what the hell does that mean
14177
i understand that
14178
it's my uncle mike he's great i love him
14182
he said just be a nice dumb guy and i
14184
didn't get it but i kind of get it now
14187
years later
14189
years later
14191
and um i think he was probably my age
14194
when he told me that's interesting wow
14197
basically what he was telling me was
14198
don't don't come across as a threat to
14200
anybody like
14202
especially your own level
14204
it don't be dumb whatever like that like
14206
he's mentioning here but just don't come
14208
across the threat just be you know be a
14210
nice guy or a nice guy whatever and you
14212
know don't try to show people up you
14214
know impress people
14215
you know your time to shine is when you
14217
impress your clients or your boss or
14220
your boss's boss if your boss is away
14221
and you just happen to be yeah yeah
14224
whatever
14225
um just be nice dumb guy don't come
14227
across the threat and a lot of times
14228
people that make it to the top
14230
sometimes they're sharks yes
14233
but they rose to the ranks as well with
14235
that mindset
14237
you know it's
14238
it's kind of like when you're
14239
interviewing to get into a company
14241
the hardest interviews are with people
14243
that are the same rank as you because
14245
they'll feel threatened yeah
14247
so now i understand be a nice dumb guy
14250
i'm homer yeah
14252
all right uh next one is uh never never

criticize condemn or complain like let

[Music]
14514
section 12
14515
only take advice from successful people
14519
it's crucial
14520
that you take advice from the right
14522
people the right people always always
14524
don't don't assume because somebody's
14526
confident
14527
they know what the hell they're talking
14528
about
14529
you know just take advice from people
14530
that have done what you want to do
14533
okay
14535
so less number 67 is you need yodas
14538
and i love this analogy
14540
uh yoda was a mentor for those that
14543
aren't star wars fans was a mentor
14545
to um luke skywalker
14548
and you need many yodas
14550
you need lots of mentors in your life
14554
and i want you to find people that
14557
work in the industry that you want to
14559
work in or currently working
14561
or people that
14562
have
14563
a perfect lifestyle that you want
14566
meaning they have a wonderful family
14568
life
14570
and
14571
they found work-life balance and they're
14572
successful and people love it when you
14574
ask them to mention them as well
14576
you gotta ask though right so you need
14577
to have
14578
many yodas and
14580
if you're working at a company now and
14582
you're not happy
14584
in the division you're in you've got to
14586
network internally and find mentors in
14588
different divisions and get them to pull
14589
you into their
14591
their team or if push comes to shove and
14594
there's a restructuring round and people
14596
are going to be let go including you
14597
maybe
14598
you can call your yoda in another
14600
department and ask them uh for help and
14603
hopefully they can pull you in you need
14604
yodas
14606
all right next up is i want you to
14609
follow people
14611
that
14612
inspire the heck out of you
14614
or are doing what you want to do one day
14617
or they're they're they're business
14619
tycoons they're amazingly successful
14622
and i put the graph there for audible
14624
which is owned by amazon
14627
and you can subscribe for a monthly fee
14629
uh i recommend doing it it's a great
14631
investment in yourself it's investment
14633
education and i want you to listen to um
14635
at least one or two books per month
14638
from successful people
14640
autobiographies
14641
or biographies if you can't find them
14644
and if you can find them where the the
14645
person that that wrote it if it's an
14647
autobiography narrates it themselves
14650
like so richard branson that's even
14651
better
14652
because
14653
you can hear their positivity in their
14655
voice and people really let their cards
14657
down once they've achieved success and
14660
they want to share success and help you
14662
to kind of pay that debt of gratitude
14664
forward so to speak
14666
so seek people
14668
find people that have written books or
14671
find the book names or whatever or or
14673
the business tycoons or icons
14675
and listen to their books
14677
so that you can understand their
14678
blueprint and why reinvent the wheel
14680
they're going to help you do it anyway
14682
they've done it
14683
they've done it
14684
and i'd love you all to one day
14686
turn your business icon
14688
uh into your rival turn your business
14691
idle into your rival yeah
14693
all right next up is
14695
i've never never met a successful person
14698
with
14699
a negative attitude
14701
and that there is uh one of searcher
14703
branson's companies uh virgin atlantic
14706
uh is
14708
i've never met anybody that's really
14710
really really successful in business
14713
that doesn't have a positive attitude
14715
because there's so much working against
14717
you there's so many naysayers around you
14719
saying you can't do it you can't do you
14720
can't do it don't take a risk you might
14722
fail people will laugh at you
14725
effort
14727
the people that make it big are the ones
14729
that are really positive really positive
14731
people make it big
14733
so if you're not a positive person it
14735
might be because you're hanging out with
14736
people that bring you down
14739

14979
next up let's talk about section number
14981
13 which is called only the paranoid
14983
survive
14984
uh it's crucial to be paranoid about the
14986
issues i'm going to talk about in a
14988
second
14989
and as you can tell there the one there
14992
uh in the 13
14993
those are those are chips and i've
14996
actually got it right here let me go off
14998
script
15003
it's a
15004
it's a pentium processor
15007
so
15008
i have those chips there in the 13 and
15011
it's from intel because there's a
15013
brilliant man
15015
uh
15016
who passed away recently god bless him
15017
he's one of the co-founders of intel um
15019
in his name is andy grove and he wrote a
15022
great book that you guys should read
15024
called only the paranoid survive
15027
and he was so paranoid running intel
15031
and
15033
intel is is a company that makes chips
15035
we all know that
15036
but what many of us forget or didn't
15038
know
15039
as documented in his book which came out
15041
in 95 95 or 96 i think i loved it
15045
intel back in the 80s and the 70s
15048
uh they made uh ram
15051
right which is random access memory uh
15053
which basically is
15054
a commoditized industry there are little
15056
chips that allow your computers to have
15058
more programs open at once
15061
and what happened was that the japanese
15063
were so competitive with intel in the
15065
early 80s
15067
in japanese companies at that time
15069
they were more interested in market
15071
share
15072
than they were in profit margin
15074
and so they they basically flooded the
15077
market with cheap ram
15079
and
15080
it intel could have gone out of business
15083
and so what happened was uh andy grove
15087
he he pivoted and he made the company
15089
focus on a new product for them
15092
called the intel processor they had
15094
what's called the 286 and 386 and 486
15097
and pentium and all that stuff whatever
15099
you probably heard that in the past uh
15100
but andy grove was was very very
15102
paranoid
15103
uh of the competition and bill gates was
15106
the same way too when he was running
15107
microsoft
15109
bill gates used to say that microsoft is
15111
always one and a half years away from
15114
bankruptcy he even said that in the 90s
15116
and of course we we know that there's no
15118
way it would go bankrupt within a year
15119
and a half
15120
but that's how paranoid he was
15123
you got to be paranoid like that like
15126
i remember
15128
i remember steven friedman and and i
15130
have the the notebook actually and i
15132
mentioned him before
15134
his son is david benioff
15137
friedman was a senior dude at at goldman
15140
and i wrote down every word he said when
15142
he came to guest lecture and i still had
15143
the notebook and i read it the other day
15146
but what he also said was
15148
watch your back
15149
because there's always somebody
15151
that's smarter faster younger cheaper
15154
than you that wants your job
15156
uh and it's it's it's kind of
15159
that's part of paranoia as well
15161
so just be careful like like for me for
15163
example
15164
i've got multiple audio tracks right now
15168
just in case it it messes up like i've
15170
got i've got a blue yeti there i've got
15173
this sure mic here i've got
15174
cheap microphones and all the cameras as
15176
well really really cheap ones just in
15177
case and so we can synchronize the video
15179
as well
15180
um
15181
just in case one of the things goes down
15183
um and
15185
whenever i give presentations i always
15187
have a second laptop which i used to
15188
borrow from a friend now i have my own
15190
whatever i'm a nerd i know uh and when i
15192
raised to give wedding speeches
15194
i would use a laptop and i'd also bring
15197
overhead slides just in case
15200
always have a backup plan always always
15202
always when i used to go to interviews i
15204
would over prepare and i would always
15206
bring a nutribar and put it in my pocket
15208
because a lot of times they forgot to
15210
feed you and if you can't if you if
15211
you're hungry you can't think and so i
15213
would go to the washroom and you know
15214
gobble down the the nutribar
15217
um but but but i was i was very paranoid
15219
and i think it helped me a lot to have a
15221
plan b and it made me more confident as
15223
well in case something
15225
didn't go well
15226
i had a backup plan
15228
so for intel
15229
the backup plan was the processor
15231
so you always want to have a plan b
15234
always always always yeah only the
15236
paranoid survive great book by andy
15238
grove read it please
15240
all right um next up is
15243
hit this key
15244
and lose your job
15249
we are one little keystroke away from
15251
destroying our lives
15253
just be careful otherwise what can
15255
happen your career is you can quickly be
15257
end it
15258
just be careful
15260
triple check all your emails you are a
15262
product a representation of of the
15265
digital communication you send out
15267
um
15268
don't just spell check and grammar check
15270
but also
15271
think to yourself
15272
can this be misinterpreted by anybody
15276
and if you're ever emotional or upset
15278
just
15279
get away from email man
15281
or from your your cell phone or whatever
15283
it is just be careful your career can be
15286
ended quickly and this is a mechanical
15288
keyboard here and i love these clicky
15290
keyboards by the way i have one like
15291
that it's by a german company called
15293
dust keyboard yeah
15295
all right next up is let the secret out
15298
and you're done
15299
and that secret is
15301
that you want to leave your company and
15304
go back to school
15306
even if it's for whatever degree
15309
don't ever tell anybody
15311
don't ever tell anybody
15312
that you want to leave
15314
unless you want to get a reference
15315
letter whatever which you can ask in a
15317
more diplomatic way which i can talk
15319
about if you want me to
15321
but
15322
if you tell somebody that you're
15324
interested in leaving to go back to
15325
school at some point
15328
you know they might
15330
they might say oh that's great that's
15332
awesome i agree it's a good idea
15335
but then
15337
the next time a recession hits
15339
and business is very cyclical
15342
and
15342
companies tend to over hire when things
15344
are going well and they tend to over
15346
fire meaning they cut into muscle not
15348
just fat when things are not going well
15350
but if they have to the way it works in
15352
big companies is
15354
if companies have to you know cut
15356
expenses so they can make their
15357
quarterly earnings when they report
15358
earnings
15359
what will happen is
15361
management will tell
15363
all the bosses in all the different
15364
divisions i need one head each that's
15366
how it works it's quantitative
15369
and
15370
your boss will think themselves well
15373
and i'm going to make this up
15375
chris is great he's one of my best
15376
performers
15378
but he told me a while i remember a
15379
while ago he told me he wants to go back
15381
to school
15382
so if he's going to leave anyway i might
15385
as well choose him
15387
dta don't trust anyone don't tell
15389
anybody at all at work that you're ever
15392
thinking of of going back to school okay
15397
all right next up is oh dude this one
15399
was so dope that was boba fett boba fett
15402
was the best character ever uh and he
15404
was barely in star wars he was in
15406
revenge of the the jedi for like a
15408
nanosecond
15410
and then han solo turned around and he
15411
fell down into that big hole he died
15414
when hans was
15415
hans couldn't see and by the way i've
15416
got to go there i'm so sorry i don't
15418
care i'm going to do this i'm i'm a star
15420
wars fan
15421
so
15423
do i have my star wars thing there it's
15424
right here yeah yeah
15426
all right
15428
so
15429
there's politics in movies as well if
15431
you're a real jerk of an actor or
15433
actress
15435
you won't get rehired and that's what
15437
happened apparently hearsay whatever
15440
with megan fox remember she's in the
15441
transformers and stuff you don't see her
15443
anymore because she was
15444
she was difficult to anyway on one of
15447
those productions you can google it if
15448
you want to
15449
and a lot of great actors that you don't
15451
hear about anymore it's because they
15452
were difficult there's politics you know
15454
at their job as well like there's
15455
politics with us that's why i'm talking
15457
about sharks but i have to talk about
15459
harrison for it because he's he's he's
15460
awesome
15463
he was so difficult to deal with
15466
in empire strikes back
15469
so difficult when they were making it
15471
that what they did was
15474
they didn't know if they were going to
15475
bring him back in to return the jedi
15478
and so what they did at the end of the
15480
empire strikes back is they froze him
15483
remember that he was frozen um anyway
15487
and they ended up bringing him back and
15488
and
15489
that's why we're talking about boba fett
15490
when he couldn't see because he was
15492
unfrozen for a while and return the jedi
15494
he yeah anyway
15496
but you gotta admit
15497
boba fett's pretty pretty dope pretty
15499
badass yeah
15501
yeah
15504
so
15505
i always have a personal backup plan
15507
okay
15508
and
15510
what remind me to do this is because
15512
boba fett's dad or something had a
15515
gazillion versions of
15516
himself made cloned whatever
15519
but always have a backup plan in terms
15521
of
15522
what do you do
15524
if your company
15526
might let you go
15529
um
15530
and a lot of times you won't know
15532
because what can happen in business is
15534
everything is going well and then we go
15536
into this horrific recession in a
15538
nanosecond
15540
or something like um
15543
like a black swan event occurs
15546
like like a virus or whatever it is or
15548
terrorist events or
15550
i don't know
15552
the 2008 crash whatever it's something
15554
you can't control they call it black
15555
swan because black swans are rare
15556
they're usually not black yeah
15560
so
15561
the backup plan is this
15563
i don't want you to be loyal
15565
to any company that's right
15568
you're thinking chris that's not ethical
15572
 loyalty
15573
i'm sorry i swore but i want you to
15575
remember this
15577
no company is going to be loyal to you
15578
and your family
15580
okay when when when push comes to shove
15582
they have to let people go you got to be
15584
loyal to your family first
15586
than yourself than the company that's
15588
right
15589
that's right you got to look out for
15591
yourself and if you don't look out for
15592
yourself and have a plan b
15595
then you're hurting your family
15597
or your future family
15599
and so if a headhunter calls you that's
15602
why that's why i put both that's right
15604
he's uh he's a headhunter or something
15606
or a bounty hunter bounty hunter that's
15608
why i put him
15610
but if if a headhunter calls you
15613
um saying that they're interested in
15615
interviewing you to maybe hire you or
15617
whatever
15618
take that meeting take every damn
15620
meeting
15622
and just don't meet with them in a place
15625
too close to your work obviously and and
15627
by the way if if your company gives you
15629
um
15632
if they give you a cell phone at work
15636
if you have um
15639
if you have enough money
15640
to do it i want you to get the exact
15642
same one
15643
for yourself
15645
because at work you know you're gonna be
15646
using that phone whatever
15648
but i also want you to have another
15649
phone just in case
15651
in case you want to make personal calls
15653
or in case and it's a good investment
15655
in case uh some other company calls you
15658
and you're setting up an interview you
15659
don't want
15660
you don't want anybody to be able to
15661
fish through your emails and personal
15663
stuff also
15665
if you work for a jerk and you will one
15667
day
15669
uh i'm not hiring though in case you're
15671
thinking i'm a jerk no but if you work
15673
for a jerk um
15675
and this jerk makes you stay late at
15676
work
15677
just for facetime whatever and it's
15679
bogus
15681
i want you
15683
on your laptop whatever
15685
to use your personal wi-fi network with
15687
these things
15689
and write a business plan
15690
on their nickel that's right if legally
15693
you're allowed to start screw that i
15695
don't care i'm i'm a pit bull and a pork
15698
chop helping you
15700
always have that plan b
15701
always always always please yeah
15705
all right next up is question motives
15710
and why do i have an old tv there
15712
i i have a tv because um
15715
whenever somebody's being interviewed on
15717
television
15719
i i want you to
15721
before accepting what they say is gospel
15723
or being true or legitimate or whatever
15726
i want you to ask yourself
15728
what's their angle
15730
why are they saying that
15732
what's their bias remember bias always
15736
if it's a ceo
15738
they're saying great things about the
15739
company because
15740
they're sales people that's their
15742
company they're not being unethical
15744
but they're biased
15746
of course they're going to say great
15747
things always
15750
and if somebody's interviewed that's a
15751
money manager like maybe they're a
15753
portfolio manager at a mutual fund or
15754
something
15757
of course you're going to talk about the
15758
stocks they own even if they disclose it
15762
of course they're going to say positive
15763
things about it there's a bias they want
15765
to get you to bottom to push them higher
15769
so always ask yourself
15771
why are they doing that
15773
you know why you gotta in your in your
15775
mind question motives and it's part of
15778
game theory which is like chess thinking
15781
a couple heads uh moves ahead of what
15783
somebody might do
15785
it's game theory
15786
always question somebody's motives not
15788
out loud but just in your mind you know
15791
it's not as politics and work and
15794
paranoia within within corporate
15795
environments is is all about
15798
game theory and chess moves you want to
15800
understand somebody like what their
15802
background is you know what their
15803
interests are and just more about them
15805
you know that's game theory you're doing
15807
your research
15808
um
15809
you want to think like they're going to
15811
think when you meet with them
15812
and you can always go to their twitter
15813
profile to see who they follow to learn
15815
more about them yeah
15817
or the bottom of their linkedin profile
15819
to see which companies or people they
15820
follow and by the way don't ever follow
15822
politicians ever ever ever on linkedin
15825
or on twitter you know if you're curious
15827
what donald trump's going to say on
15828
twitter you can go and type up the real
15830
donald trump and see for a while but
15832
don't follow you know even if you're
15834
republican it doesn't matter
15835
just
15836
yeah be careful
15838
all right um
15840
that's paranoia i guess
15842
all right and that's what the back of
15844
tvs used to look like there yeah they
15845
weren't dude they were massive back then
15847
massive yeah
15849
all right uh so now i want you to go to
15850
your workbook and click number 13
15852
meaning section 13
15854
on the front page
15856
and then spend three minutes writing
15857
down notes
15858
on how you can apply the lessons we just
15860
talked about here
15861
in section 13
15863
to enhance your your career you got
15865
three minutes go

16036
[Music]
16042
all right section 14 risk taking i love
16045
this one i love this one
16047
it's crucial you take the right kinds of
16049
risks you'll never get ahead in life
16051
unless you take risks and plenty of
16053
risks and embrace failure embrace
16056
failure and fail fast and i'll get to
16058
that soon
16059
all right so let's talk about risks
16061
yeah fail fast and fail
16064
early
16065
okay um
16066
if if you start a company
16068
give yourself two years
16071
and after two years
16073
i want you to ask yourself
16075
if i had known
16077
about all the issues that i uncovered i
16079
discovered over the past two years would
16081
i have still have started this company
16083
and the answer is no
16085
pull the plug
16086
move on
16088
you're going to start a lot of companies
16090
in life and as mark cuban said you only
16092
have to be right in business one time
16096
every single amazing business person you
16098
know of
16100
you only know about their successes you
16102
don't know about the crappy companies
16103
they started and they failed the best
16105
you know like uh
16107
bill gates and paula allen together
16110
they started a company called trafford
16112
ida where they had these little wires on
16114
roads you know when you go over it
16117
and it counts cars they failed
16119
yeah so fail fast and fail early and
16122
don't give a damn what anybody thinks
16124
anyway because you are going to make it
16126
huge one day regardless what anybody
16128
thinks you give a damn what people think
16130
anyway fail fast fail early keep moving
16133
forward
16136
all right next up is
16138
opm not the drug
16140
but opm stands for other people's money
16142
and that's danny devito
16144
great actor funny man
16146
um he was in this movie called other
16148
people's money which is a great movie
16150
you gotta watch it because it will
16151
explain to you
16153
what is private equity in a fun way it's
16155
a great movie and like every hollywood
16158
movie the rich person loses at the end
16161
or is a schmuck or becomes nice or
16163
whatever it is what it is there's no
16165
exception every movie because i have to
16167
appeal to everybody whatever
16169
i should stop now
16170
but um i actually learned that from rush
16172
limbaugh is that terrible years ago
16174
uh the the rich person's always a
16176
schmuck a movie but but watch that movie
16179
if you can because it'll really explain
16180
you what what opm other people's money
16183
and how private equity works but the
16184
reason i put opm here
16186
in devito
16188
is because
16189
i don't want you to use your own money
16191
to start companies
16193
if you have a lot of money yes you can
16196
but i don't want you to put your family
16198
at risk or put too much stress on
16199
yourself
16200
i want you to raise money from high net
16202
worth investors
16203
but i want you to raise money from high
16205
net worth investors initially
16207
okay
16208
now the sales cycle is quite shorter
16210
than going after venture capital and if
16212
you network and find something in common
16214
with people and you present with passion
16216
right from your heart like i'm going to
16218
teach you you will be able to raise
16220
money
16221
and when you raise money i want you to
16223
make sure that you pay yourself the same
16224
salary at least that way you make at
16226
that previous company
16228
you're at
16229
because i don't want you to bring your
16230
stress home
16232
i want you to
16233
make sure your family is happy and
16235
you're happy as well
16237
use other people's money you can do it
16240
if if you don't think you can
16242
then you won't be able to
16244
but you know it as henry ford said
16247
whether or not you think you can do it
16249
you're right
16250
be relentless like a pit bull on a pork
16251
chop
16252
and it will happen i promise you
16255
all right next up is
16257
um don't invest if all the founders have
16260
left and i put here and you can go if
16262
you want just do it do a search um
16265
on on me chris
16268
haroon venture beats so venture beat is
16272
the
16273
it's it's like the wall street journal
16274
but for
16276
uh for uh for venture capital
16278
um and then you just you'll find this
16280
article i wrote years ago uh and i wrote
16282
about this and i really do believe it
16284
that um
16286
when i found and i was just a guest
16287
columnist i love writing like it's fun
16289
for me and it's good for your career too
16291
and we'll talk about embracing the media
16292
really really soon how can help you it's
16294
free pr
16295
everybody wins they win you win
16298
so network a lot to get meetings with
16300
the media and i'll talk more about that
16302
later on but when um
16306
when a founder leaves a company
16308
when all the founders leave a company
16309
and are no longer engaged at all
16312
you gotta run for the exits man
16315
you do
16316
because most of the time
16318
that company won't be as successful in
16319
the long run
16321
because what happens is founders run a
16323
company
16324
and the board loves the founder
16326
and investors love the founder
16329
and the founder doesn't give a damn
16331
about anybody except making that company
16334
change the world in the long run and so
16336
they're given a lot of leeway like jeff
16338
bezos or elon musk whatever
16341
um i shall let me stick with with jeff
16342
bezos on this one so jeff bezos he
16346
doesn't even get on the earnings call
16347
the quarterly call he doesn't care he's
16349
long-term focused he doesn't care if
16351
people are saying
16353
well you're not going to be making a big
16354
profit this quarter so you know i i
16357
think we should find another ceo
16359
no
16360
investors are long-term greedy and
16362
focused on bezos that's why they own
16364
amazon
16365
if he left that company point watch out
16369
because what would happen is this like
16371
it does with most other companies where
16372
the founders all leave and are no longer
16373
engaged
16374
usually
16375
what happens is
16377
bureaucracy and politics
16380
rule everything because if if you're at
16383
a and it happened with with uh with
16385
buddies of mine i worked at
16386
hewlett-packard
16387
you know they were senior executives and
16391
they didn't want to take any risks
16393
because you know they were getting a
16394
nice paycheck and climbed the corporate
16396
ladder and if they took a risk
16397
and they created a new department or
16399
product they they if they messed up
16402
they're not going to get promoted
16403
they're done
16404
and if they are successful with that
16406
they're not going to get paid a huge
16407
amount anyway
16409
so the status quo
16410
is
16411
keep being a politician collect that
16413
paycheck you know grip and grin which i
16416
despise
16417
climb through the ranks
16419
and and be political i hate it
16421
but if the vander still there the
16423
founder doesn't give a damn about
16424
politics the founder is long-term
16426
focused remember what warren buffett
16428
said the longer the view the wise
16429
intention
16430
and they're not political at all so be
16432
careful be careful about when founders
16435
all leave a
16436
company all right so please go to your
16439
workbook
16440
and on the first page as always
16442
click on number 14.
16444
uh and then um
16445
spend three minutes writing down notes
16447
on how you can apply the lessons
16449
in section 14 to enhance your career
16452

16638

16640
mean it it looks the way it's supposed
16642
to look but what i was trying to do
16643
there is this is actually a setting from
16646
the first movie blade runner 1982
16648
classic
16649
um and it's one of those chinese
16652
restaurants that harrison ford ate at
16654
anyway
16655
i had a lot of fun doing this i feel
16656
like an artist with this a crappy artist
16658
i get it like i'm no uh
16661
i'm no picasso and i'll leave picasso
16663
here to give me a little bit of uh
16665
inspiration and you got to do a search
16667
on picasso quotes he's got great quotes
16669
so anyway castle's my friend i have more
16671
hair than him though okay
16673
so um
16675
yeah let's talk about these ones here

talk a lot about how to give a great
16695
presentation and how to raise money
16698
by having fewer bullet points on a slide
16702
i'm telling you you don't have to work
16702
as hard now three bullet points on a
16704
slide because we can't handle more than
16706
three things at a time uh on on a slide
16708
when you're trying to raise money
16709
whatever
16710
uh and if you do try to use images or
16712
some fun innovative way to do it
16714
less
16715
is more quite often people will only
16718
read the first page of a very very long
16720
report anyway
16721
less is more
16723
and if you have to write a big report
16725
then you know try to
16727
you know
16729
try to have like a summary on the first
16730
page or lots of summaries and i even did
16733
this um
16735
see the berlin wall behind there i even
16736
did this with this book like i realized
16739
that you know shorter chapters are
16741
better like each no chapter i don't
16743
think there's maybe one or two that are
16745
longer on the page but a lot of them are
16746
really really short
16748
really really short you know less is
16750
more and that's how people consume media
16752
these days you know gone are the days
16754
when you
16756
gone are the days when when you read a 5
16759
000 word editorial article in vanity
16762
fair whatever it is or whatever
16764
newspaper it is
16765
less is more
16766
that's why twitter is twitter
16770
all right moving on oh yeah i started to
16773
use
16773
yeah movement here might be a little
16775
distracting sorry
16778
i want you to present with passion and
16780
enjoy public speaking
16782
condition yourself to love it and you'll
16784
excel at it and most people are
16786
terrified of it and i'm going to make
16787
you into presentation rockstars very
16789
very soon in the smc courses
16793
enjoy it embrace it
16796
all right next up is
16799
shut up and i say with love my heart
16801
speaking of the hardest up there i made
16802
it smaller but it's still beaten
16804
shut up if you think you close the sale
16808
don't sell past the close
16811
sometimes when you when you get the
16813
impression somebody
16815
loves a product that you're selling or
16816
service
16818
don't sell it anymore stop
16820
stop right away
16823
otherwise they're gonna think this this
16825
is what will be going through their mind
16826
okay
16828
they'll be thinking oh gosh i love this
16830
product i love this service gosh chris
16831
is doing a great job selling i love it i
16833
love it
16834
why does he keep selling it am i missing
16836
something am i a sucker why am i so
16838
lucky to be given this opportunity i
16840
don't trust him
16841
i don't know oh no i do trust him i
16843
don't i just don't know he's overdoing
16845
i'm not gonna buy
16852
next up is small clients are just as
16855
much work as big clients and sometimes a
16857
hell of a lot more
16859
try to bag the elephant if you can go
16860
elephant hunting
16862
[Music]
16863
that i don't mean that way but just try
16864
to get big customers if you know what i
16866
mean instead of smaller ones
16868
um
16869
because
16870
small small customers are small
16872
customers are more work than big
16873
customers sometimes they have
16876
more of their net worth with you and
16877
that's why
16879
um or they spent more money as a
16881
percentage of their net worth on on the
16883
product or service they bought from you
16884
than a bigger customer just be careful
16887
um you know i i i value all my customers
16890
uh and i love them all sincerely i do
16893
but
16894
and for me it doesn't matter it's kind
16895
of a moot point because all my customers
16897
are the same right it's the same pricing
16899
point always
16900
but when i used to work um and i would
16903
get customers
16905
the biggest customers were the best
16907
because the amount of time and
16908
hand-holding i had to do with them was
16910
much less because they were more
16912
sophisticated sometimes as well yeah be
16914
careful be careful
16917
all right next up we've got all i heard
16920
was not no
16922
i want you to sell sell sell sell sell
16924
sell sell and keep selling keep selling
16925
keep selling keep selling until you
16927
sense they're interested then stop
16928
talking
16930
until then keep selling selling selling
16932
selling and tell yourself in your mind
16933
all i heard was not no all i heard was
16935
not no and don't forget to ask for the
16937
sale like a lot of times people go to
16938
meetings sales meetings and they'll talk
16940
about their product
16941
and they'll have a great lunch with
16943
somebody whatever and they never ask for
16945
the sale you gotta ask
16947
but don't get discouraged until you hear
16950
the word no
16951
and by the way when you hear the word no
16953
it basically means not yet
16955
all i heard was not no
16959
all right
16962
next up
16963
talk business later
16967
bond as much as you can with your
16968
clients a big rookie mistake is you show
16970
up and you start talking business right
16972
away you know business we know it's
16974
about relationships first and product
16976
knowledge second
16977
talk business later okay
16981
all right
16983
how to get a meeting with anyone so the
16985
route of how to get a meeting with
16987
anybody
16988
is as we know
16991
you want to find something in common
16992
with them right and the stars kind of
16994
got all kind of a line for somebody to
16996
take a meeting and and love you and do
16999
business with you
17000
so you want to
17001
appeal that personal
17004
personal motive so to speak
17006
um find something in common with with
17008
somebody you know um and and i talked
17011
about how to get
17012
informational meetings using linkedin et
17014
cetera cover pages by finding something
17016
you have in common maybe you're from the
17017
same hometown
17020
talk about your hometown
17021
when you meet with them you know how to
17023
conduct that meeting anyway
17025
and talk about how your hometown has
17026
changed or the schools change whatever
17028
it is and what i was going to do
17030
actually for for this uh
17032
for this um
17034
let me go back actually i don't want to
17035
look at that baseball one yet now you're
17037
all looking at the baseball ones we're
17038
there let me go back here yeah so what i
17040
was trying to do initially and i
17042
couldn't find the right 3d models to do
17044
it
17045
was i saw this great movie ratatouille
17049
and
17051
great movie i'm sure you've all seen it
17053
it's about a rat
17055
that
17056
makes good food
17058
and there's a critic
17060
a really really mean food critic that
17062
comes into this dude's restaurant
17065
and
17066
the rat is nervous and so the rats like
17070
what kind of food should i make
17072
well i want to appeal this person's
17074
background his emotions
17077
and so what happened was the rats
17079
made ratatouille i guess that's why it's
17081
called that
17082
uh it's and when the food critic you
17084
gotta watch it man there's that one
17086
scene where they they pull in and push
17088
back at the same time on his face when
17090
he takes a bite of the ratatouille and
17092
he drops the
17094
the the fork in in slow motion
17098
and then the the food critic goes back
17101
in time and remembers
17103
growing up and his mom basically
17106
touching his face uh and giving him
17108
ratatouille as a child
17112
i couldn't find that image so i looked
17113
everywhere for it i couldn't find it
17116
but you got to check it out
17117
you got to appeal to emotions
17120
and find something in common with
17121
somebody as well it's a different angle
17122
different way of thinking but it works
17124
exceptionally well
17126
you gotta yeah every battle's law
17128
enforcement fought as you know
17130
um and speaking of ratatouille so the
17132
best restaurant in america
17134
is called french laundry and it's about
17137
a 40 minute drive north of where i live
17139
here
17140
um it's it's in napa valley i've never
17143
eaten there it's too expensive for me
17144
it's 500 bucks to eat there not
17146
including alcohol
17147
and
17149
what rats what the folks at pixar did
17152
was they actually went
17154
to um when they were doing research on
17156
the movie
17157
all the kitchen scenes for ratatouille
17159
were modeled exactly
17161
after french laundry uh up in napa
17164
valley it's pretty cool it's pretty cool
17165
and speaking this is a good little side
17167
note here but but speaking of um
17170
speaking of pixar
17172
in 2008
17174
i went to a party here uh for one of my
17177
kids
17178
they were in the whole birthday party
17180
phase between the first grade and fourth
17181
grade whatever
17182
and i met this guy at a house here in
17184
hillsborough
17185
and you know a lot of my best contacts
17188
actually are through my my kids friends
17189
parents it is what it is
17192
and this guy at that point in time
17194
he worked at pixar
17197
and i asked him i said oh dude i'm a big
17199
fan
17200
what movie are you making next
17202
he said well
17203
it's this movie about this
17205
old man
17207
and this
17209
short little fat kid
17212
and
17213
there's a bird named kevin
17216
and
17218
they throw some balloons on the house
17219
the house goes up in the air and they go
17221
on a journey
17223
and i'll never forget what i said to him
17224
i said it very politely i said this
17227
i said
17228
dude that's a merchandising disaster
17230
like you're not going to sell any toys
17232
like it's it's like
17234
why would you why i mean the incredibles
17237
was awesome you can make incredibles
17239
part two three four five six whatever
17240
you make a gazillion toy stories because
17242
you know toy story you got all the toys
17244
and my kid loved that that woody or andy
17246
doll whatever it was
17248
um and buzz lightyear
17251
and he said to me he said you know chris
17255
we don't make movies we think people are
17257
gonna like
17259
we make movies from our heart
17261
we don't try to do it to make money it's
17263
not about money
17265
it's about touching somebody's heart
17268
by using our own heart
17271
and and
17272
my goodness was he right
17274
because up
17276
that movie was the bomb i loved it not a
17279
bomb it was awesome i loved it and the
17281
soundtrack too by michael cameron's last
17283
name but
17284
oh my god and there's one scene from
17286
that movie too where he goes his wife
17288
passes away it's sad
17291
but that like
17293
three or four minute entire lifespan of
17295
that guy's life
17296
um when he was young when he met her to
17298
the great pen he had remember the great
17300
pen he had uh got married they couldn't
17302
have kids and she passed away
17306
i'm just getting shivers thinking about
17307
the music just appealing emotions anyway
17310
it was a great movie a little off track
17311
there but
17312
thinking with your heart is great
17314
because if you don't think with this
17315
this don't work this ain't gonna work
17318
so always try to appeal the emotions uh
17320
if if you can i'm gonna put picasso back
17322
on the shelf here
17324
all right good
17326
all right next up is uh confidence uh
17329
leads to competence i love baseball i
17332
had to throw a baseball in there
17333
somewhere
17334
um
17335
and
17337
you'll never like
17339
athletes do exceptionally well because
17341
they're confident you'll never see an
17343
athlete who's
17344
who doesn't have confidence
17346
especially in baseball where dude like
17348
you've got somebody's throwing a ball at
17351
you that's 100 miles an hour that's
17353
curving it might hit you
17355
you got to be confident
17357
it's even harder in qriket dude because
17359
in cricket that ball can bounce as it's
17361
curving and then hit you
17363
and and there's a windmill as well it
17366
yeah you got to be confident i think
17368
therefore i am
17370
uh in lebron james
17372
before each basketball game he meditates
17374
and he thinks of himself shooting shots
17376
getting in it over and over and over
17378
again that's almost as good as
17379
practicing
17380
um confidence is a it's an attractive
17383
trait
17385
um
17386
and for those of you that are trying to
17387
get a date
17389
if you don't come across as co i'm not
17391
gonna i suck at dating but you gotta be
17393
confident man
17394
you gotta go in there ask somebody out
17397
and just tell yourself i don't give a
17398
damn if they say yes or no and if they
17400
say yes i'm not gonna
17402
i'm not gonna say do mind games never
17404
you gotta
17406
you gotta be confident you know what i
17408
mean polite but confident too yeah
17412
yeah
17414
all right
17416
so yeah confidence leads to a competence
17418
if you believe in yourself um
17421
there's there's nothing you can't do
17423
and that's why on wall street they love
17424
to hire former athletes actually a lot
17427
of the time give me one second check
17431
yeah all right
17432
um they like to hire former athletes
17435
because they're confident
17436
and a lot of jobs on wall street you're
17438
in sales
17439
and if you're confident and you're
17441
selling not arrogant but if you're
17442
confident
17444
then confidence leads to perceived
17445
competence
17449
all right next up is sports is crucial
17453
boardroom talk it is it is
17456
um and not everybody's a sports fan and
17458
you can talk about movies and whatever
17460
arts or whatever it is that interests
17462
you
17463
but
17465
talking about sports
17467
is i mean
17469
i could talk to anybody in about
17471
baseball at least if i meet somebody
17474
from st louis you know i'll talk about
17477
one of the best pitchers in history bob
17479
gibson
17480
if i meet somebody from baltimore
17482
they'll talk about cal ripken the iron
17484
horse and some of you might not know who
17486
these people are
17487
but i say this only because if you tell
17489
me what city you're from
17492
i i will immediately talk about a
17494
baseball team in that city if there's
17495
baseball and that's it overseas it might
17498
be you know football like the real
17500
football like the one you you kick
17501
soccer yeah
17503
um
17504
don't
17505
don't underestimate how important sports
17507
is
17508
you know that's why a lot of
17509
corporations
17510
they do a lot of sporting events like
17512
they'll they'll take clients to to
17514
tennis matches
17516
um they'll
17518
you know they'll rent out boxes at
17520
football stadiums basketball stadiums
17522
i've gone to a ton of hundreds actually
17524
of baseball games and boxes
17526
as well as basketball games too
17528
in hockey games too when i worked at
17530
golden we actually had a suite and maple
17532
leaf gardens years ago yeah it's
17534
important it's important and and i say
17536
boardroom talk because there's always
17538
before a board meeting starts you know
17541
people are always just kind of hanging
17542
out and haven't seen each other in three
17543
months
17544
board means usually quarterly
17546
and you know
17548
before the minutes i read from the
17549
previous meeting and somebody says let's
17551
start the board meeting you just chit
17553
chat and usually talk about sports or
17555
something else you have in common just
17557
it's great for idol chit chat and you
17559
can always go to somebody's um
17562
twitter profile see if they follow
17563
athletes i follow jesse barfield he used
17565
to play for the toronto blue jays and
17567
you can tell i'm a
17568
blue jays fan it's it's
17571
it's in my heart like i love it i love
17573
it it's what my brother and
17575
you know my dad and i have in common and
17577
my kids love it too and it just
17580
i just love it i absolutely love it
17582
um and it's a great way to bond with
17584
people as well and i remember in 1992 we
17587
finally we won our first world series
17590
typical american oh my god people can be
17591
pissed off i don't care here we go
17593
it's called the world series
17595
because
17596
well
17597
it was always called the world series
17599
even there's only teams in america
17601
and they they put a team in toronto as
17603
you can see there in 1977 that was the
17604
first game
17606
and then in 1992 we finally won the
17608
world series in toronto and of course i
17611
had that i got teased all the time by my
17613
american friends who are very witty they
17615
teased me about boots being canadian so
17618
i teased them i remember that 92 after
17620
on the world series i was like ah
17623
ah yeah we won the world series yeah
17626
who's who's the king now huh
17628
and they said to me it was so funny it
17630
was good
17631
the retart was yeah so what dude
17634
your americans beat our americans
17636
i was like oh shut the up okay
17638
anyway it was funny sports is crucial
17640
boardroom talk yeah
17644
all right
17646
next up is golf often
17649
and i know golf can seem expensive
17651
it's not if you look around and play at
17654
crappy places which is what i do
17656
in fact my son dylan um
17660
it was personal here
17662
so my middle child here dylan it's like
17664
a son of me i'll stop using the same
17666
jokes over and over again i promise you
17668
oh here we go you can kind of see it
17669
there yeah okay i should use this one to
17671
begin with
17672
so uh dylan
17673
this guy here in the middle
17675
his golf teacher uh is a guy named matt
17678
who's uh my videography i i hired him
17680
he's a great guy he's a great guy i met
17682
matt at crystal springs which is a golf
17684
club where it cost you 30 bucks play
17686
around it's a great deal it's a great
17687
deal
17688
um
17689
but um and actually i'll talk about the
17691
reason why i hired matt only because
17693
he's editing this i'm just kidding
17696
um so he was um
17700
he's really social
17701
and you can pick up a conversation with
17703
him about anything anything nice guy
17706
nice guy
17707
um and and he noticed that i was reading
17709
a book on
17710
youtube and he said to me oh cool you're
17714
looking into youtube whatever
17716
and then i sized him up in 30 seconds i
17718
knew i knew right away but he talked
17720
about green screens and all this stuff
17721
nice guy though nice guy more important
17723
than anything else you know
17724
relationships are more important than
17726
product uh product knowledge
17727
uh but but you got to make sure that um
17730
if you can get on the links and golf
17732
with people and don't worry if you suck
17733
and you're new to it
17734
so what so what i don't know like
17738
get out there have fun with a couple of
17740
buddies
17741
you don't have to be me and by the way
17743
i've learned a lot about people by
17744
golfing with them if somebody cheats in
17746
golf i'm convinced they're going to
17747
cheat in business i've seen it i've seen
17749
it yeah
17750
yeah
17752
golf off and uh if you can if you can
17754
yeah
17755
all right uh and it's always like i've
17757
actually i've gotten some of my biggest
17759
investors on the golf course
17761
by accident
17762
like they ended up playing with us on an
17765
average course whatever
17767
they're like hey do you mind if we
17768
there's two of you there's two of us can
17769
we play with you and i met people that
17771
way
17772
and they become my biggest investors
17774
yeah it's amazing um yeah anyway
17777
next up is
17779
number 16 which is dress for success
17783
it's so true
17784
um
17786
you got to play the part
17787
like a lot of times before you get
17788
promoted you have to kind of dress um
17791
like
17793
somebody one level above you very subtly
17795
don't overdo it
17797
um but you have to dress for success
17800
and people will judge a book by its
17801
cover
17803
so
17804
you know like in silicon valley it's a
17805
little bit different here you can just
17807
kind of be laid back and whatever wear
17810
crappy clothes and people wouldn't be
17812
wearing what i'm wearing
17813
but i think it's important it's
17815
important how you carry yourself
17817
especially because you're not going to
17818
get too much exposure to senior
17820
executives right away
17822
dress for success
17824
all right
17826
next up is leverage the media oh yeah
17828
this is where i was going to come back
17829
to it
17830
so
17831
mark benioff who uh
17834
he's the founder of the largest company
17836
here in san francisco called
17837
salesforce.com and a wonderful
17839
humanitarian
17840
a good guy
17842
i read his book called above the clouds
17844
where he had a bunch of tips on how to
17846
make it
17848
and one of them was
17849
leverage the media
17851
and i first met mark i think a couple
17853
years before salesforce went public in
17855
o4
17856
and
17858
i i remember he was at all the goldman
17860
sachs conferences when i worked at
17861
goldman and then later on when i was a
17862
client of goldman in the hedge fund
17864
industry
17865
and he was always on panels saying
17866
software is dead software is dead cloud
17869
is the future the cloud's the future and
17871
we're all like i don't understand but he
17873
sounds passionate so cool i like it
17875
and he was selling something you can't
17877
see feeler touch something virtual
17879
something boring cloud computing but he
17881
made it exciting
17882
but he was being controversial it was
17884
brilliant
17886
by saying that software is dead
17888
and
17889
i ended up working in his building same
17891
building
17892
one market plaza here in san francisco
17894
and actually i'd see him sometimes
17896
walking his dog and bare feet his
17898
beautiful labrador in bare feet on on
17900
the main floor the lobby the public
17902
lobby he didn't give a damn that's why
17904
he's successful he doesn't care
17906
and i remember once i went out to dinner
17907
with him and i sat beside him before the
17909
ipo
17910
and we were up in the bank of america
17912
tower on like the 50th floor uh and
17915
i'll never forget he wore hawaiian shirt
17918
he was just himself it's just mark it
17920
was cool man mark with a c
17922
and
17923
it was a a a fee pricks or
17926
fixed menu or whatever it is
17928
and what happened was every time they
17931
brought some food over he didn't want
17933
he very nicely gently took his knife and
17936
fork and put into a big x
17939
but he was just himself but he leverages
17941
the media big time and the way he
17943
leverages the media is
17945
he's controversial and controversy sells
17948
and you got a network and i taught you
17950
how all how to network uh using your
17952
backgrounds and all good stuff linkedin
17954
find journalists and meet with them okay
17958
and and
17959
be a little bit controversial as well
17961
like for me if i were to do it
17963
and i'm probably not going to
17965
but if i did i would say
17967
two-thirds of harvard business school
17970
hbs two-thirds of hbs is bs
17973
and if i went on talk shows and did that
17975
i get some air time then they'd say what
17977
about harun business school i said it's
17978
a different age okay leave me alone
17980
but i could do something like that or
17983
like if you look at um
17986
richard branson
17988
when he launched virgin cola one of his
17990
many virgin companies and he declared a
17993
war on coca-cola and pepsi
17994
he rented a tank in the early 80s
17997
and drove through times square with
18000
virgin cola cans all over it of course
18002
you couldn't do that today
18003
but he was controversial controversy
18005
works
18006
leverage the media as much as you can
18010
because it's free advertising as well if
18011
you do it right
18013
all right next up is
18016
please go to your workbook and click on
18017
number 15.
18019
the cover page meaning section 15.
18022
then please take a boot three minutes
18025
writing down notes on how you can apply
18027
the lessons
18029
in section 15 to enhance your career
18032
you've got three minutes go
18042
[Music]
18053
so
18059
[Music]
18069
[Music]
18107
[Music]
18125
[Music]
18137
so
18140
[Music]
18145
[Music]
18184
[Music]
18211
section 16
18213
think
18214
different i love this section i had so
18217
much fun putting this together uh and i
18219
wrote the top there crucial
18221
highly profitable differentiation
18223
strategies
18224
uh and so
18226
what you see here really shapes my
18228
character
18230
this changed my life
18232
this computer here and i never threw it
18234
out
18235
um and so let me let me grab it hold on
18236
a second
18239
whoops
18244
this here is from an old um
18247
this is a before that mac came out this
18249
is from apple ii which we had as a kid
18252
and um
18254
i just pulled this out for the first
18255
time in
18256
decades and on it here i don't know if
18259
you guys can see it i'll read it you
18260
probably can't read that uh but it says
18263
um
18264
getting older i gotta look like this
18266
galaxian
18268
um ms pac-man
18270
hero and mario brothers and championship
18274
load runner
18275
yeah
18276
oh and i took a hole puncher i remember
18278
this i took a hole puncher here
18280
so that you couldn't erase it i guess on
18282
both sides or whatever it is this is in
18284
the days when you take the disc out and
18286
flip it but this here is from an apple
18288
ii
18289
um
18290
and let me just put this down here
18294
this thing changed my life okay
18298
and and i remember when um
18301
steve jobs decided not to
18303
ship these things with disk drives
18305
anymore and people thought he was crazy
18306
he was thinking different he was
18307
brilliant because of it
18309
um i guess i can get a pin to take that
18311
out there but whatever
18313
um yeah this is ms-dos years ago but i
18316
remember i was um i was younger and
18319
they wanted to fail me in the sixth
18320
grade in the eighth grade and it was
18322
because
18323
well they thought i had a learning
18324
disability but them sorry
18326
i have this gripe with teachers like my
18329
school i went to when i was younger
18331
it's a
18332
well-known school whatever and they've
18334
asked me to come back and give guest
18335
lectures and keynotes or whatever it is
18338
never i'll never mention them either i
18340
think that a teacher should
18342
not have an us versus that mentality and
18344
look to look down upon students but
18346
treat the student as a customer
18348
uh and build their confidence
18350
right that's
18352
confidence is the most important thing
18353
in business
18355
one of the most important things
18356
you know with confidence you you can
18358
achieve anything last thing you need is
18360
is a a bastard teacher trying to
18363
bring you down
18365
or a teacher that's just teaching so
18368
that what they can do is they can do
18370
research in university that's why i love
18372
them teach um but anyway sorry there's a
18374
lot of beautiful wonderful teachers in
18375
the world okay most of them are sorry
18377
about that off topic
18378
but but they want to feel me and so i
18381
went to this
18382
it was a testing center uh in uh
18385
oakville so my dad says oakville
18388
ontario oakville
18389
uh on lake shore road called chisholm
18392
uh and they tested me there um whatever
18395
i think they were wrong i think they
18396
were but my dad bought me this and the
18399
second he bought me this
18401
everything took off for me i loved it i
18404
had fun with it you can tell i like i
18405
enjoy this stuff like i light up like a
18407
christmas tree like tweety bird like i
18408
enjoy this stuff
18410
i love using technology and that was my
18412
passion one of my passions i guess
18414
but this changed my life this this box
18417
here and the original ones if you open
18419
it this is not an original one but if
18420
you open it steve jobs and his whole
18422
team signed everything and this is ice
18424
put my mouse here i had a velcro on the
18426
side and i still do that actually under
18428
the table with other stuff yeah
18430
um
18431
you can see all the all the baseball
18432
stuff and everything yeah so anyway
18435
this thing here changed my life and so
18438
it it's fitting that we now talk about
18440
think different you know what i'll do is
18442
i'll i'll leave this dude up here with
18443
me
18444
actually i'll put it back here because
18446
that camera won't work
18448
all right so so think different is the
18449
title of this one here and i want the
18452
galera to get in your face there
18454
good okay
18456
think different
18459
and i used a product code called adobe
18461
dimension to make all this stuff if
18463
you're curious it's easy to use i can
18465
show you if you care
18466
all right so think different
18470
so lesson number 90 we're almost done
18472
is be a contrarian and watch your net
18476
worth soar
18478
um if you buy the same stock everybody
18479
else buys you'll
18481
i've said it before but
18483
you won't make money in the long run
18484
because who's the incremental investor
18485
to push it higher you've got to be
18486
contrarian
18488
and just be aware of bubbles they they
18490
occur
18491
yeah and hundreds of years ago in europe
18493
there was a tulip tulip bubble uh and
18496
everybody chased the momentum and kept
18498
buying these tulip bulbs which kept
18500
going up in price an insane amount
18502
um and if you weren't a contrarian you
18504
you lost your shirt and human nature
18506
repeats itself office all right next up
18508
is
18508
big companies cannot innovate
18512
and i'll always bet on two girls or two
18515
guys in a garage to change the world
18517
uh instead of a big company always
18520
always
18522
small groups of people can always change
18524
the world
18525
always always always i think it's
18527
competitive advantage and
18529
jeff bezos the way he runs amazon
18531
is he won't let any meeting take place
18533
uh if
18535
more than two pizzas are required to
18537
feed the room that's why amazon's still
18539
very successful they're big but they
18541
kind of run like a startup
18543
big companies cannot innovate remember
18546
that to the same extent uh especially i
18549
should say if a founder leaves i should
18550
correct that yeah if a founder leaves
18552
especially because after steve jobs left
18554
apple as much as i love apple
18556
what have they done
18558
you know they they
18560
made a watch which
18561
is doing okay they don't publish number
18564
of watches they sell because they're
18565
probably not selling as many as they
18566
thought they should have i don't know
18568
i still don't know what the killer app
18569
is for this thing i've i've got it or i
18571
put it aside here actually it's over
18573
here
18574
um i wear it and i met johnny ive um at
18577
um
18577
san francisco moma dinner events we were
18580
honoring him
18581
um and right when before this thing came
18583
out and i said to johnny i talked to him
18585
uh and he's the the guy he used to the
18588
british dude with a short hair
18590
with with a british accent he speaks
18592
good and all of us nice guy very serious
18593
though
18594
i asked him i said what's the killer app
18596
for this
18597
and he said
18599
we don't know yet but perhaps the haptic
18602
feedback which by the way is just
18604
vibration that's what it means but he
18606
sounded really smart by saying haptic
18608
feedback he said perhaps that haptic
18610
feedback will be a way for
18613
families and i enjoy it i have the
18615
product but
18616
he said it's a way for say a husband and
18618
wife they're in bed together
18620
and not that but there's a newborn baby
18623
in the middle sleeping with them
18626
and um
18628
the husband
18630
gets up or the wife whatever to go to
18631
work and if the alarm goes off it wakes
18634
up the baby is disaster so
18636
this is another way to wake you up
18638
whatever because it vibrates on your
18640
wrist but he didn't know what the killer
18641
wrap was at at the time but but since
18644
steve jobs god bless him has moved on
18646
they haven't really done that thing
18647
anything too radically different like
18649
they made a bigger ipad
18651
a thinner ipad a bigger iphone a cheaper
18654
iphone
18655
um
18656
yeah so anyway i don't think that big
18659
companies can innovate as much uh if the
18661
founder has left so don't
18663
don't ever feel
18666
intimidated by a big company
18669
because don't forget that
18672
apple was
18673
basically steve wozniak and steve jobs
18676
in a garage
18678
taking on ibm successfully yeah
18682
yeah
18683
so there it is there it is the computer
18686
changed my life yeah
18688
yeah
18689
all rights
18692
i'm going to show you this commercial to
18693
you now
18694
this commercial you're about to see
18697
was only shown one time in history
18701
it was shown
18702
in 1984
18703
during the super bowl
18705
and 1984 is
18708
the title of a book by a brilliant man
18710
uh who wrote animal farm
18712
um the man's name is is george orwell
18715
about
18716
an awful future
18718
where
18719
we're slaves to the government whatever
18722
and so what happened was
18724
this commercial was only shown once
18726
and it was 1984 during the super bowl it
18728
cost a million dollars to make and
18730
ridley scott was the guy who directed he
18732
did gladiator uh as well as top gun
18736
um and um
18737
it was brilliant it was brilliant and as
18739
you watch it obviously you'll know which
18742
character represents apple and which
18744
character represents
18746
big blue or ibm
18748
uh and the woman actually that that um
18750
represents apple um was uh sylvester
18754
stallone's wife at the time so check it
18756
out i hope you enjoy this and while you
18758
watch it just remember that
18760
one person or a couple of people small
18762
groups people can destroy a big company
18766
today we celebrate the first glorious
18769
anniversary of the information
18771
purification
18773
we have created
18788

shall talk themselves
18814
on january 24th apple computer will

18822
like 1984.
18825
it's pretty powerful
18827
okay
18828
next up is the most important chart ever

18833

18964
good one eleanor roosevelt

said
18967
you wouldn't worry so much about what

and then one more here
18997
there we go
18998
and eleanor roosevelt by the way she
19000
also had another great quote which was
19001
something along the lines of
19004
they're going to criticize you anyway so
19006
you might as well just do it
19009
okay
19010
oh i love this picture this one's

mark twain he's great
19030
he said 20 years from now
19033
you will be more disappointed by the
19035
things you did not do
19037
than by the ones you did do
19039
so throw away the bow lines
19041
sail away from safe harbor
19044
catch the trade winds in your sail
19046
explore
19048
dream
19049
discover
19051
brilliant
19052
brilliant
19055
all right
19057
so form your own opinions please
19061
all right number 93 is take that walk i
19065
was inspired by gandhi with the salt
19067
march uh and i actually tried to um i
19070
tried my best to find one with a lot of
19071
people following it cost a fortune like
19073
i got a lot of these for free they're
19075
royalty free but
19076
there was one that cost a hundred
19077
dollars that was tempted so i didn't
19079
pull the trigger but but great man great
19081
man but
19085
so steve jobs
19087
used to
19088
go on these long walks every day at one
19089
o'clock
19091
and i do it as well and i put it on my
19093
schedule a lot of times
19095
take that walk
19096
and when you go for a walk it helps you
19098
to think differently
19100
it helps you to release serotonin it's
19102
it's like when you exercise when you
19104
feel like crap
19105
and then you do a little bit of weights
19106
whatever or exercise
19108
it releases serotonin in your brain
19110
makes you happier
19112
and
19112
this thing rewards this thing
19115
and a lot of my best ideas yeah i think
19117
about when i'm walking you know i've
19118
written entire courses
19120
on long walks i used to take 12 to 14
19123
hour walks
19124
by myself uh it just it was
19127
life-changing and it's fun too you can
19129
bring some tunes if you want classical
19130
music whatever
19132
um
19133
and then just go to a starbucks or tim
19135
hortons or coffee shop like that
19137
whatever it is
19139
and just just collect your thoughts yeah
19142
it'll allow you to kind of get outside
19144
your own body and see the forest from
19146
the trees and where you are in life and
19147
where you want to be
19149
yeah
19150
all right next up we've got passion for
19153
platforms that's a road
19155
obviously
19157
so the best type of business models you
19159
can create are ones where you
19162
you own the road
19164
and
19165
cars go on the road and you can charge
19167
the cars or the toll booths kind of like
19169
facebook is a platform for social media
19171
i don't trust them
19173
it's amazing facebook actually doesn't
19174
publish anything
19176
but they make money by publishing other
19178
people's stuff because it's a platform
19180
they're a tool keeper
19181
airbnb
19183
who'd have thought that the most
19184
important hotel company in the world
19186
wouldn't own a single hotel
19188
their platform
19191
same thing with uber who would have
19192
thought
19193
that the biggest taxi company in the
19194
world now uber doesn't own a single taxi
19198
they own the platform
19200
that's how i want you to think about
19202
business models
19203
because once you own the road
19205
then you can charge the car so to speak
19207
and you get other people to be
19208
incentivized to populate your platform
19211
it's brilliant the ebay has done it
19213
microsoft did with windows ios google
19217
it's amazing it's incredible
19223
all right next up we have don't respect
19225
tradition respect innovation i was
19227
trying to be innovative here as much as
19229
i could
19230
um
19233
everything is going to be disrupted and
19235
product cycles are getting shorter and
19236
shorter and shorter now and disruption
19237
is happening faster faster faster
19240
but just don't don't respect tradition
19243
i'm not saying you'd be a jerk whatever
19244
but just
19246
always question everything every product
19248
can be disrupted
19250
you know microsoft windows used to be
19252
the most dominant operating system
19254
platform on every device basically
19257
and then windows ce never worked like
19259
microsoft really should own
19261
the uh you know
19264
the smaller form factor operating system
19266
market they don't they don't don't
19269
respect tradition respect innovation
19271
always always always yeah
19273
i had a lot of fun making that slide
19275
all right so please go to your workbook
19277

19467
section 17
19469
it's crucial to find your passion
19473
you be you it's a little cloudy but what
19475
are we looking at there number 17
19478
you be you we save the best for last
19479
here
19480
okay
19482
so
19484
i want you to be honest and speak from
19486
the heart always
19488
just be yourself
19491
you know people might not remember what
19492
you said but never forget the way you
19494
made them feel that's a great quote from
19496
maya angelou but just be you man just be
19498
you
19499
don't be a robot don't be data from star
19501
trek you know be kirk
19504
just your ursula just be yourself and
19507
and when you're up there on stage if you
19509
mess up whatever
19511
you ever see somebody on stage they kind
19512
of mess up a bit and you start liking
19514
them a lot more
19515
because they're a real
19516
person you kind of like that just be
19519
yourself don't give a damn what anyone
19521
thinks
19523
you got this far in life
19525
and your family and friends love you
19527
for being you
19528
so why try to be somebody else
19531
you know when you were younger in school
19532
you were yourself everyone loved you
19534
then you start working
19536
you get older and you're in the
19537
workforce whatever
19538
and you're not being yourself
19541
why what's the point
19544
do you know that when a senior executive
19546
walks by you in a big company and if you
19548
if you suck up to them
19551
or if you're not yourself
19553
do you know that they don't respect you
19555
more for that they lose respect for you
19557
and even worse your colleagues hate you
19559
for it
19561
just be yourself
19563
it's too hard to try to be somebody else
19565
anyway
19567
and as dr sue said the great thing about
19569
having kids is when you read them books
19571
at night sometimes i feel like the
19573
author of the book is
19574
is
19575
talking in two languages one to me and
19577
one of my kids
19579
you know it's like the simpsons it's so
19581
brilliantly written the simpsons when i
19583
used to watch it my parents were around
19584
my parents would laugh every now and
19585
then when they were half paying
19587
attention because it was written at a
19589
different level like they would quote
19590
old movies and stuff whatever
19592
but dr seuss
19594
he said
19596
those who mind don't matter
19598
and those who matter
19600
don't mind
19602
just be yourself
19604
everybody else is taken
19607
all right next up is listen to your
19610
spouse
19611
they love you
19612
they fell in love with a certain person
19615
that was themselves and that person
19617
might have changed a bit
19618
go back to being you
19620
listen to your spouse
19622
they will help you
19623
they'll help you a lot
19625
they'll be your your senate your sober
19627
second look when you have an idea that
19629
you're not sure if you should
19631
pull the trigger on so to speak
19632
career-wise
19634
you know sometimes you'll look to get
19636
advice from lots of people and you
19637
forget
19638
that your life partner the one you can
19640
trust most in life
19642
is right beside you remember why you got
19644
married in the first place
19646
you know only my wife can tell me
19649
that i'm wearing a shirt that went out
19650
of style eight million years ago i
19652
thought plaid was still in in style it's
19654
not apparently
19655
or if i've dyed my hair too dark i'm
19658
getting better now it used to be a
19659
little bit too dark at times
19660
um
19662
listen to them listen to them yeah
19666
so there's that guy too he looks kind of
19667
cool it's funny
19669
all right you be you listen to yourself
19672
next up
19674
don't let anyone rent space in your head
19678
don't ever be somebody else's prisoner
19683
don't give a damn what they think about
19684
you
19686
because
19687
as you become more successful they're
19689
gonna backstab you anyway and remember
19691
unjustified criticism is nothing more
19694
than a disguised compliment
19696
get them out of your head
19698
ethan
19700
those who mine don't matter and those
19701
who matter don't mind i had to say that
19702
one again
19703
don't let anyone rent space in your head
19707
live your life to make yourself happy
19710
don't live someone else's life to make
19711
them happy
19715
all right next up we've got
19717
take time for you damn it
19720
yeah
19722
you got to schedule time for yourself
19724
like when you make the the one pagers um
19727
and you can always download that again
19728
from
19730
i'll tell you in a second it's kind of
19731
complicated the link but i'm gonna show
19732
you the graph in a minute but take time
19734
for you like
19736
i don't know if you're stressed out
19738
like schedule time in for you to
19741
unwind
19742
and
19743
binge watch
19745
curb your enthusiasm if that makes you
19746
laugh
19747
or or
19749
i don't rent that movie you've been
19750
dying to see for a while
19752
um or
19754
take a day off from work and don't go
19756
because you're mentally drained take
19758
time for you
19760
take time for you
19761
schedule time for you
19763
otherwise you'll burn out
19765
and what's the point you're gonna make
19767
yourself happy and if you don't laugh
19769
every day you got to find a way to laugh
19770
every day what made you laugh when
19772
you're younger like when i started
19774
today's lesson today's uh
19776
lecture i sat in that chair
19778
that made me happy
19781
put yourself back in that situation
19782
remember the trigger point the trigger
19784
point is an event that occurred in your
19786
life that made you so insanely happy
19790
that when you think of it again shivers
19792
just thinking about it and this this one
19794
here this is the jose batista one here
19796
and by the way if you're curious

19816
blue jay card so anyway
19819

don't pull my arm too hard i'll be there
19848
in a second and help you i love it i
19850
love it
19851
but i wrote here you're you're never too
19853
old to start over you're never too old
19855
to start over
19857
you're not you're not
19859
um
19860
colonel sanders
19862
he actually used to live in my hometown
19863
of mississauga which is just outside
19866
toronto which has a bigger population
19868
mississauga than san francisco but most
19869
people don't know it
19872
but colonel sanders
19874
he started uh kfc and it's interesting
19877
it was actually for marketing reasons
19879
they rebranded kentucky fried chicken to
19882
kfc to de-emphasize the the letter f
19885
for fry
19887
but when um
19888
colonel sanders he failed a lot in
19890
business his entire life then he was 65.
19894
way before i was born he was 65 and he
19897
started kfc
19898
and he made it huge he did really really
19900
well
19901
so you're never too old
19903
to start over and people today are
19905
living 26 years longer
19907
than they did back in the 1950s
19910
so if you're 65
19912
you're not
19914
you're 39
19919
and you're never too young to change the
19921
world as well
19923
look at the beetles i've actually got
19924
them can you see it up there yeah at the
19926
top there awesome the beatles up there
19928
that's abby road and by the way oh this
19930
is awesome
19931
the reason why um
19934
the reason why they did that album cover
19936
and it was so innovative at the time
19938
because it was the first album cover
19940
without the name of the band
19942
but they were the most four recognizable
19943
people on the planet
19945
but i gotta i gotta go off script and
19947
get this but they were gonna go to mount
19949
everest because this was gonna be the
19951
triumph their last big album
19953
uh ended up not being their last album
19955
and then what happened was they uh
19957
i don't know life got in the way and
19960
john was spending time with yoko and
19961
paul is spending time with linda and
19963
whatever
19964
and they're like screw it i don't want
19966
to go to everest that's a lot of work
19967
man
19968
so the name of the studio they were
19970
recording was called abbey roads
19972
and they walked right outside abbey road
19973
and they're like
19974
screw it let's do it let's just take a
19976
picture here let me get i want to show
19978
it to you
19979
so the beatles and i have to talk about
19981
this because you know the beatles
19983
but they did all their brilliance in
19985
their 20s in their 20s
19988
unbelievable
19989
so if you think you're too young
19992
to um change the world
19995
these guys did it in their 20s in their
19998
20s it's unbelievable
20001
and by the way if you're old older like
20003
me
20005
and you're you
20006
you always wanted to start a rock band
20008
outfit do it now you'll be the first 80
20010
year old rock star someone's got to do
20012
it we're living longer anyway so you're
20014
not 80 or 17
20016
54. yeah
20017
all right
20018
so um
20020
i want to go through this here quickly i
20022
want to show this to you all right so
20023
abby road it's because it's cool and
20025
we're going to study this in marketing
20026
but i have to do it now i just have to
20028
i'll show it to you here actually
20030
what you've got here is they went
20031
outside and they took a picture
20033
and they learned that controversy sells
20035
in marketing okay so what they did was
20037
this
20038
there was a rumor that paul mccartney
20040
was dead there was a rumor he was dead
20042
um in fact if you listen to the end of
20045
strawberry fields and you play it
20046
backwards
20047
it says uh i buried paul
20050
um although john lennon said it actually
20052
says cranberry sauce it says i bury paul
20054
they're messing around with the media it
20056
and there's a rumor and then what
20058
happened was that rumor spread for a
20060
long long time
20061
and here in sgt pepper's there's a patch
20064
on paul's
20067
shoulder here you see this
20070
i got to make sure this the light's not
20071
there okay good hold on right there and
20074
people thought that said opd
20076
but it actually like officially
20078
pronounced dead opd that's actually opp
20080
yeah you know me opp is ontario uh
20083
provincial police opp because i used to
20085
live in the province of ontario we call
20087
them ontario party poopers
20089
and then um right here i think this is
20092
the best one to show here
20094
let me get it right because this is
20096
fascinating check this out this is cool
20097
being controversial helps you sell like
20099
mark benioff damn it okay here we go
20102
so
20103
you can see here this is a funeral
20105
procession
20106
uh and so john lennon is in white there
20108
okay and he's the priest
20110
then you've got uh ringo starr
20113
the drummer
20114
he's he's uh he's wearing uh he's the
20116
pallbearer the guy that carries the
20118
coffin
20119
then in the back you got the gravedigger
20120
which is george harrison
20122
um and then you've got paul mccartney
20124
who's in bare feet um smoking see the
20127
cigarette there in his hand signal uh
20129
signifying death because they even knew
20130
back in the 60s hey man smoking's bad
20133
and if you look closely
20135
this here is a volkswagen beetle it's a
20138
reverse here right right here beetle
20139
it's clever
20140
and the license plate if you zoom in
20142
it's probably hard to see here
20144
but it says
20145
28 if
20147
meaning if paul mccartney were alive
20149
he'd be 28. they were playing around but
20151
controversy cells maybe have to hold up
20153
here and matt you can zoom in if you
20154
want there we go yeah
20157
yeah anyway so that's pretty cool and
20159
even on the back people thought this guy
20160
was a a skeleton or something whatever
20163
it's pretty cool
20164
pretty cool so um
20166
it was neat it was neat yeah
20168
yeah so
20170
and initially with this album they
20171
wanted to put which is oh my gosh it's
20174
genius
20175
they want to put it in a paper bag
20177
george mart the producer did and because
20180
they uh they thought they were gonna get
20182
sued by people here bob dylan everyone
20184
but whatever
20185
a little bit off topic there but
20186
interesting nonetheless
20188
we gotta pull this over here cuz we're
20189
gonna talk about this in a minute
20191
all right we're still recording great
20194
yeah so you're never too old uh to start
20196
over again
20197
right just remember that that uh john
20199
lennon song starting over
20201
um
20202
and i actually met annie levitz who took
20205
the the picture of john lennon actually
20207
uh on and i got to show you really
20208
quickly because i met her she's the best
20209
photographer of the last century she's
20211
amazing and she was at a benefit just
20214
around the corner here um that i went to
20216
and i got to meet with her and she she's
20217
amazing
20218
but let me show you actually so annie
20220
levitz and there's a reason i'm showing
20222
this okay annie leaves
20225
i asked her also like i do with
20226
everybody why are you successful
20228
and she had some unbelievable things to
20230
say
20231
uh but you've seen a lot of her her
20233
pictures right so um
20236
yeah leonardo dicaprio you've seen the
20238
cover of vanity fair demi moore and all
20240
that stuff there she is there she's
20241
wonderful
20243
star wars she's the last oh right before
20245
my goodness before she passed away
20246
that's right just amazing pictures
20249
but i asked her why are you successful
20252
and she said because
20254
her um my favorite actress in history
20256
here
20256
she said because
20258
when i was younger
20260
my father was in the army and we moved
20262
around all over the world and all over
20263
america and so i spent my youth
20266
in the back of a a station wagon
20269
a car
20270
and i kept i saw america through a
20273
different vantage point
20275
because i was looking outside the window
20277
and that window was a metaphor for a
20279
frame for a picture right is that right
20282
like that yeah yeah a frame
20284
and so she thought saw things
20285
differently
20287
and let me show you um i'll show you the
20289
john lennon picture she she took
20290
actually uh on the day he died and she
20293
my god this is brutal but the day that
20296
john lennon was shot
20297
um
20300
she did a photo shoot okay
20302
and she was working for rolling stone at
20304
the time
20305
uh and and she took um
20308
like this picture here right is is was
20310
one that's yokono and john lennon
20312
obviously
20313
it initially
20315
um
20316
i'll just show you these ones here so
20318
initially yoko wasn't supposed to be in
20320
the photo shoot
20321
and john said no
20323
she has to be and i only agree to do
20325
this photo shoot if you put yoko on the
20327
cover of the of the rolling stone
20329
magazine with me
20331
uh and so what what she did was um
20335
this is it here yeah um this is this is
20337
the cover here yeah
20339
so what what happened was uh
20342
he was some some jerk named mark david
20345
chapman uh
20347
took away john len's life with with a
20349
gun at the dakota on the upper west side
20352
in 1980 i think
20354
and then after the guy shot him
20356
after he shot lenin he was leaning again
20358
i'll show you that picture there sorry
20360
i'm going to scroll down
20361
he was leaning against uh
20363
a lamppost waiting for the police to
20365
arrive reading catcher in the rye yeah
20367
out there i know
20368
but um
20370
oh and so the editor of rolling stone of
20372
course they wanted to put uh john lennon
20374
on the cover
20375
with something on the lines of
20377
the the day the music died or something
20380
um and um
20381
just john lennon and he said absolutely
20383
not yoko's got to be there as well i i
20385
promised promised john lennon yeah but
20387
she showed a couple more pictures how
20389
she saw things differently like she took
20391
a picture of nixon
20392
um when when he was uh
20397
no longer the president united states
20399
and for those who don't know about this
20400
richard nixon used to be president who
20401
was no longer he was booted for lying
20404
about something yeah
20405
um and so she showed the picture she
20407
told me how she
20408
she wanted to think differently from
20410
from the peer group
20412
from other people and so she took this
20413
picture here and everybody took the
20415
picture of of
20416
nixon going i'm not a criminal or when
20419
he left her we were in the helicopter um
20422
and you can go that if you want but
20424
here's a picture she took which was
20425
pretty cool
20426
man and she saw she waited until nixon
20429
was in the helicopter leaving the white
20431
house launch she was there
20432
uh there's the washington memorial right
20434
there uh and she took a picture here of
20437
these these three dudes here
20439
putting their hands in her hat so that
20440
that hat didn't blow away
20442
which is pretty cool so anyway
