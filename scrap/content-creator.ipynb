It simply means â€“ how your startup makes money. Now, if you're ever wondering why your business doesn't grow or why investors aren't interested, it could be because your business model isn't proven or tested. \n",

So, let's not try to create a new game plan, rather pick one of the already working ones and learn from it. Now I'm dropping the billion-dollar checklist - nine successful business models.\n",

      "- **Software (SaaS)**: This is where you charge customers a monthly or yearly fee to use your cloud-based software.\n",
      "- **Transactional**: These are often financial tech companies. They help make transactions happen and take a small piece of each transaction.\n",
      "- **Marketplaces**: These are platforms that bring buyers and sellers together. It's like a meeting point and some famous examples are Amazon and eBay.\n",
      "- **Hard Tech Businesses**: Likely dealing with physical and tangible stuff, like hardware or technology.\n",
      "- **Usage-Based**: These businesses charge based on how much service you use. The more you use, the more you pay.\n",
      "- **Enterprise**: Specially designed for businesses and corporations.\n",
      "- **Advertising**: Making money from ads, like Google does.\n",
