       "\"0\\nmy name is michael uh i work here at y\\n2\\ncombinator\\n3\\ni helped run the accelerator uh before\\n5\\nthat i did two yc startups\\n7\\num one 2007 and one in 2012.\\n10\\nand today i'm going to talk to you about\\n13\\na\\n13\\nminimum viable product so mvp\\n17\\nwe always yell at founders to not use\\n19\\njargon yet we have this whole set of\\n21\\nstupid startup jargon and mvp is one of\\n23\\nthem\\n24\\num when you think about an mvp you\\n26\\nshould think about something\\n27\\nridiculously simple\\n28\\nthis is the first thing you can give\\n32\\nto the very first set of users you want\\n34\\nto target\\n35\\nin order to see if you can deliver any\\n37\\nvalue at all to them\\n39\\nthat's all it is it's extremely simple\\n42\\ni know you guys had a talk last week\\n44\\nabout how to come up with ideas how to\\n47\\ncome up with problems you want to solve\\n49\\nwhat i will tell you is that it is\\n50\\nhelpful to talk to some users\\n52\\nbefore you decide to build your mvp this\\n54\\ndoesn't mean you have to go into a\\n56\\nthree-year\\n57\\nkind of research situation or you have\\n60\\nto work in industry for 10 years\\n63\\nbut some conversations are helpful it's\\n65\\neven more helpful if you're your own\\n67\\nuser so you can tell whether your\\n69\\nproduct's working for you\\n71\\ni always get this strange question of\\n73\\nhow do i get my first users\\n75\\nwhich always kind of confuses me because\\n77\\ntheoretically you decide\\n78\\nto solve a problem that you know\\n81\\nsomeone has so the way you get your\\n84\\nfirst user as you talk to that person\\n86\\nthat you know has the problem\\n88\\nand if it's you it's even easier so um\\n91\\nif you are building a product for a\\n92\\nmysterious set of users that you have no\\n94\\nidea who they are\\n96\\nquestion that slightly um very slightly\\n101\\nokay so the goal of a pre-launch\\n104\\nstartup um is extremely simple\\n107\\nstep one launch quickly this is\\n110\\nsomething that's been part of the yc\\n112\\nethos from the very beginning and it's\\n114\\nbeen\\n114\\ngreat advice for 10 years and it\\n116\\ncontinues to be great advice\\n118\\num if you can walk away from one thing\\n120\\nfrom this presentation\\n122\\nit's launched something bad quickly\\n125\\nthat's it like literally the rest of\\n127\\nwhat i'm going to say is basically going\\n129\\nto be\\n129\\nre-summarized versions of that same\\n131\\nthing the second thing that an early\\n133\\nstage startup needs to do is get some\\n134\\ninitial customers\\n136\\nget anyone using your product you don't\\n138\\nhave to have a vision of how you get\\n139\\neveryone using it but just\\n141\\nanyone interacting and seeing if they\\n143\\ncan get value out of the product\\n144\\nyou'd be surprised at how many founders\\n147\\njourneys\\n148\\nend before a single user has actually\\n152\\ninteracted with a product they've\\n153\\ncreated\\n154\\num it's very very common so please get\\n157\\npast the step it's extremely important\\n160\\nthe next one is talk to your users any\\n163\\nof them\\n164\\nafter you've launched this mvp and get\\n167\\nfeedback\\n168\\nthis is one that's also extremely common\\n170\\nmistake because most founders in their\\n172\\nheads have a\\n173\\nidea of what they want to build and so\\n176\\nthey kind of have this weird feeling\\n177\\nthat if i haven't built\\n179\\nthe full thing yet getting feedback on\\n181\\nthe shitty initial thing is kind of\\n183\\nuseless of course it's not going to work\\n185\\nit's not the full thing the full things\\n186\\ncan take\\n186\\nthree years 10 million dollars a whole\\n188\\nteam so\\n190\\nfeedback on the little thing is useless\\n192\\nthe reality is that\\n194\\nin some ways the full thing is this\\n196\\nreally awesome idea in your head that\\n198\\nyou should keep in your head\\n199\\nbut it should be very very flexible\\n201\\nbecause it might turn out the full thing\\n203\\nthat you want to build\\n204\\nisn't what your customers want at all so\\n207\\num\\n207\\ni have the saying hold the problem\\n209\\nyou're solving tightly\\n210\\nhold the customer tightly hold the\\n212\\nsolution you're building loosely\\n215\\nand last most important iterate and i\\n217\\nlike to kind of distinguish between\\n219\\niterating and pivoting\\n221\\na lot of founders once they've figured\\n223\\nout how to build something\\n224\\nfall in love with it and so if it\\n226\\ndoesn't work for a certain set of users\\n227\\nthey start thinking\\n229\\nwell i wonder what other problems this\\n231\\nthing can solve\\n232\\nwell you know the screwdriver is not\\n234\\nactually good at screwing in anything\\n236\\nbut i wonder what other problems it\\n238\\ncould solve and they're like oh maybe\\n239\\nyou can use it to cook maybe you can use\\n241\\nit to clean and it's like no\\n243\\nlike the problem was i need to screw\\n245\\nsomething in\\n246\\nthe user was like a mechanic and if your\\n248\\nscrewdriver doesn't\\n249\\nhelp the mechanic solve the problem keep\\n251\\nthe mechanic\\n252\\nkeep the problem i need to screw\\n254\\nsomething in fix the screwdriver\\n256\\nlike that's the thing that's broken\\n259\\nright the broken thing is not the\\n260\\nmechanic and it's not the fact that they\\n262\\nneed to screw something in\\n263\\nso iterate continue improving on your\\n267\\nsolution\\n268\\nuntil it actually solves a problem in\\n270\\nmost\\n271\\ncases most people should be building a\\n273\\nvery lean\\n274\\nmvp so by that we mean\\n277\\num you should be able to build it fast\\n280\\nin weeks not months\\n282\\nthis can either involve software or\\n284\\nhonestly we see startups just start with\\n286\\na landing page and a spreadsheet but\\n290\\nmost startups can start very very fast\\n293\\nsecond extremely limited functionality\\n297\\nyou need to condense down what your user\\n299\\nneeds what your initial user needs\\n301\\nto a very simple set of things a lot of\\n303\\ntimes founders want to address\\n305\\nall of their users problems and all of\\n307\\ntheir potential users when in reality\\n310\\nthey should just focus on a small set of\\n312\\ninitial users\\n313\\nand their highest order problems and\\n316\\nthen ignore the rest until later\\n319\\nyou should have a vision of everyone you\\n321\\nshould have an mvp\\n323\\nvery small all this is is a base to\\n325\\niterate from\\n326\\nthat's it it's just a starting point um\\n329\\nit doesn't\\n329\\nit's not special in any way you just\\n331\\nhave to start\\n333\\nand so please make sure you don't feel\\n336\\nlike your mvp is too special\\n338\\nokay uh here is a classic example uh\\n341\\nthis is\\n342\\none of airbnb's first landing pages uh\\n345\\nin 2008\\n348\\ni believe one of the things that you\\n350\\nmight be interested in about\\n352\\nin airbnb's first product is that there\\n354\\nwere no payments\\n356\\nwhen you found a place to stay on airbnb\\n358\\nyou had to exchange\\n359\\nmoney with the host in person needless\\n362\\nto say that was\\n363\\na pretty big problem but they\\n366\\nstarted without payments\\n368\\nno map view you know how when you search\\n369\\nairbnb you can see where the house is in\\n372\\nthe city\\n372\\nyou don't have that sorry um and\\n375\\nthe person writing all the code nate was\\n377\\nworking part-time\\n379\\nokay so everyone tells these kind of\\n381\\nmagical stories about how everything was\\n383\\nperfect from the beginning\\n384\\nairbnb not perfect from the beginning\\n388\\nuh the next one twitch this was what\\n391\\ntwitch\\n391\\nlooked like day one not very familiar\\n394\\nwell maybe a little familiar there's\\n396\\nsome video there and there's some chat\\n397\\nthere\\n398\\nother than that nothing else uh twitch\\n401\\nlaunched as\\n402\\njustin tv which was a online reality tv\\n405\\nshow\\n406\\nthere was only one channel justin you\\n409\\nhad to follow his life if you didn't\\n410\\nlike his life you had to leave the\\n411\\nwebsite that's all there was\\n414\\nthe video was extremely low resolution\\n418\\nit was funny a founder asked me back in\\n420\\nthe day like oh like wasn't it weird you\\n422\\nguys had video in your apartment weren't\\n423\\nthere all these like secret documents\\n425\\nand things that like people would be\\n426\\nable to see and it was like\\n427\\nyou could barely recognize our faces let\\n429\\nalone\\n431\\ndocuments that we had um and most\\n433\\nimportantly there were no video games\\n435\\nno video games except if we decided to\\n437\\nplay video games in our apartment like\\n439\\nthat was the only time video games ever\\n440\\nappeared\\n441\\nand so let me just say you can do that\\n443\\nquickly\\n444\\nwhen you think about twitch it's much\\n446\\nmore complex now\\n448\\nlast stripe which wasn't stripe it was\\n450\\ncalled slash dev\\n451\\npayments because why not like let's make\\n453\\na name that's really easy to remember\\n455\\num this was stripe day one\\n459\\nno bank deals i won't tell you exactly\\n462\\nhow they process payments but\\n464\\nuh it was in a very startupy way\\n468\\nalmost no features and even cooler if\\n471\\nyou wanted to use stripe the stripe\\n472\\nfounders would come to your office and\\n474\\nintegrate it for you\\n476\\nhow nice is that um half because\\n479\\nthey were just desperate to get anyone\\n480\\nto use it and half because it was a\\n482\\ngreat way to find bugs before the users\\n483\\nfound bugs uh integrate yourself\\n486\\nso these are just three examples of\\n489\\nextremely simple extremely fast to build\\n492\\nmvps\\n494\\nall of these are billion dollar\\n496\\ncompanies and they all started with\\n497\\nsomething that most people would say\\n499\\nis pretty shitty in very few cases you\\n503\\nhave to build\\n504\\na heavy mvp i just invented that term\\n507\\nheavy mvp when i made this presentation\\n508\\ntwo days ago so uh\\n510\\nyou know maybe it becomes a thing if\\n511\\nyou're in an industry with significant\\n513\\nregulation like insurance or banking\\n516\\num sometimes drones although sometimes\\n519\\nnot um\\n521\\nit's hard to launch it's it's harder to\\n524\\nlaunch you have to pass through a bunch\\n525\\nof regulatory bodies first\\n527\\nif you're doing hard tech if you're\\n528\\nbuilding rockets it is hard to build a\\n531\\nrocket in a couple weeks\\n533\\nbiotech it is hard to invent a cancer\\n535\\ndrug in a couple weeks\\n537\\nmoonshots well fill in all the other\\n538\\nblanks it's hard to\\n540\\nbore tunnels in the earth and have\\n542\\nextremely fast vehicles that replace\\n544\\ncars in a couple weeks\\n546\\nso if you're in that situation\\n549\\num please remember that your mvp can\\n552\\nstart\\n553\\nwith a simple simple website that\\n556\\nexplains what you do\\n558\\num it's helpful when you talk to people\\n560\\ninteract with people that they\\n562\\ncan refer back to something so that can\\n564\\nbe your start and you can build that\\n566\\nsimple website in days not weeks so\\n568\\nmany ways maybe your heavy mvps are\\n570\\nfaster than your lean mbps in some weird\\n572\\nstrange way\\n574\\nnow i want to talk about launching for a\\n576\\nsecond because a lot of founders have\\n577\\nthis misconception about launching\\n579\\num they see big companies launch stuff\\n582\\nand they assume that's what startups do\\n583\\nin fact they see companies they kind of\\n584\\nthink about like startups\\n586\\nfacebook's not really a startup anymore\\n588\\nbut they see them getting a lot of press\\n590\\nand getting a lot of buzz and yadda\\n592\\nyadda and they have in their head that\\n593\\nthat's what a successful company\\n595\\nlooks like when they launch well let me\\n597\\nask you\\n598\\nthis question um how many here remember\\n601\\nthe day that google launched\\n604\\nno how about facebook\\n607\\num okay how about twitter no\\n611\\ngreat so it turns out that launches\\n614\\naren't that special at all\\n616\\nokay so if you have this magical idea of\\n618\\nyour magical launch you want to do\\n620\\nthrow it away it's not that special the\\n622\\nnumber one thing that's really important\\n625\\nis to get some customers so to make\\n628\\npeople feel better\\n629\\nlet's use different terms how about\\n631\\nlaunch is when you get any customers\\n633\\nand how about like press launch press\\n636\\nlaunch really impressive\\n637\\nis when like people write about things\\n639\\nand it's all exciting and you get all\\n640\\nthis buzz\\n641\\nlet's push the press launch off and\\n643\\nlet's push the get\\n644\\nany customers launch really really soon\\n648\\nthat's our goal here it's a lot\\n651\\nharder to learn from your customers when\\n653\\nthey don't have a product they can play\\n655\\nwith\\n656\\nyou know you can talk to your customer\\n657\\nall day but you have no idea whether the\\n659\\nthing you want to build can solve their\\n660\\nproblem\\n661\\nif you put the thing in front of them\\n663\\nand it doesn't solve their problem\\n664\\nyou know right away and so all the\\n667\\nresearch in the world is good but until\\n669\\nyou can put something in front of people\\n670\\nyou have no freaking idea whether it's\\n672\\ngoing to work\\n674\\nso spending all that time on a pitch\\n675\\ndeck is not as valuable as spending your\\n678\\ntime building\\n679\\nanything that you can give to a customer\\n682\\nfinally some hacks for building an mvp\\n685\\nextremely quickly\\n687\\nfirst time box your spec so your spec is\\n689\\nthe list of stuff you need to build\\n690\\nbefore you launch\\n692\\ntime box it say okay what happens if i\\n695\\nwant to launch in three weeks\\n697\\nokay well the only things that could be\\n699\\non my spec are things i can build in\\n700\\nthree weeks that makes your life a lot\\n702\\nsimpler it allows you to remove all the\\n704\\nfeatures you can't build in three weeks\\n707\\nsecond write your spec this seems really\\n710\\nstraightforward but most people\\n712\\nthis one up\\n713\\nit's really easy to change what you're\\n715\\nworking on before you ever launch it\\n717\\nbecause you never write it down you\\n719\\nstart working on something\\n721\\nyou talk to a user they say oh i would\\n723\\nnever use that or god forbid you talk to\\n724\\nan investor and they say oh that could\\n726\\nnever be a company because\\n727\\ninvestors know everything and so you\\n729\\ndecide to change what you're working on\\n730\\nand because you never wrote it down you\\n732\\ndon't even really realize you're\\n733\\nchanging it\\n734\\nand so your three week plan turns into a\\n735\\nthree month plan\\n737\\nif you write down at least you can\\n738\\nbe honest with yourself\\n740\\nthat you're changing your spec all the\\n741\\ntime\\n743\\nthe next one is cut your spec a week\\n746\\ninto your kind of three week sprint\\n748\\nyou probably realize that you added too\\n750\\nmany things to your spec and you're not\\n751\\ngonna make your deadline\\n752\\nthat's okay just cut the stuff that\\n755\\nclearly isn't important\\n758\\nand if there's no non-important things\\n759\\nstart cutting important things\\n762\\nmost of the goal here is just to get\\n764\\nanything out in the world\\n766\\nonce you get anything out in the world\\n767\\nthe momentum to keep anything going\\n770\\nis extremely strong once you have any\\n772\\nonce you if you don't have anything out\\n773\\nin the world\\n774\\nit's very easy to just delay delay delay\\n776\\ndelay\\n777\\nand then last don't fall in love with\\n778\\nyour mvp so many people\\n781\\nfall in love with the vision in their\\n783\\nhead and none of the products i showed\\n786\\nyou before was the initial vision\\n788\\nof what it ended up being so please\\n791\\ndon't\\n791\\nfall in love with your mvp um it's just\\n795\\nstep one in a journey you wouldn't fall\\n798\\nin love with a paper you wrote in the\\n799\\nfirst grade\\n800\\nand like that's like the level of impact\\n802\\noften your mvp\\n804\\nhas all right it was great talking to\\n806\\nall of you thank you very much\\n829\\nyou\\n\""

      "# Lecture Notes on Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n",
      "\n",
      "Good day, everyone! \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, let's have a chat about the concept of a 'Minimum Viable Product' or 'MVP'. I know we always remind you not to use complex words and here we go...using startup jargon ourselves! \n",
      "\n",
      "Startups often use the term 'MVP'. And we need to break this down and make it simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know when we talk about an MVP, we're talking about something unbelievably easy? Yep, that's right. It's as plain as it can be. Think of it as the very first thing you can offer to those initial users you're trying to reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we do this? It's to test if we can provide some sort of value to them, no matter how small. That's what an MVP is all about. It's a simple approach. Nothing too fancy or jumbled. It's about testing your product with real users and learning from that experience.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# How To Develop Ideas and Solutions for Your Startup\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming up with ideas or finding problems that need solving is a vital part of creating your startup. Here's a little advice on how you can go about it: \n",
      "\n",
      "**Speak to potential users before creating your MVP** - This doesn't mean you have to plunge into a three-year research project, or gain 10 years of industry experience. Sometimes, just having a few conversations with potential users can give you a lot of insight. The closer you are to your user, the better. Ideally, you should be solving a problem that you, yourself, have experience with. It makes it much easier to gauge if your product is really solving the problem it intends to.\n",
      "\n",
      "A frequent question I run into is - \"**How do I find my first users?**\". This question always leaves me a little puzzled. Theoretically, you should already have someone in mind, someone who has the problem your product aims to solve. Your first user could be this individual. If that person happens to be you, all the better! \n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you find yourself creating a product for a \"mysterious\" group of users, whose needs and wants you don't understand... well, it might be time for you to take a step back and reconsider. It's absolutely essential to know and understand your users for your startup to succeed. So get out there and start having those conversations!\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# The Path of a Pre-Launch Startup: Simple Steps to Success\n",
      "\n",
      "Good day, everyone! Today, we're going to chat about the path of a pre-launch startup. I promise you, it's much simpler than it may seem at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's begin with **step one: launch quickly**. This mantra has been a cornerstone for successful start-ups for many years. If you take away anything from our time together today, let it be this: *launch something, even if it's not perfect, and do it as fast as you can*. Trust me, I could talk all day about this concept and it will circle back to this key point.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The second step is to find your first customers**. You don't need to have your whole customer journey plotted out just yet, but you do need someone using your product. Alarmingly, many budding entrepreneurs' journeys end before a single person has ever interacted with their product. Don't let that be you. Any interaction can bring valuable insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, **have conversations with your users**. After launching your bare-bones version of your product, it's crucial to listen to your early users. Some entrepreneurs mistakenly believe that feedback at this stage is pointless because the product isn't fully developed. The truth is, flexibility is key at this stage. You might find that the grand vision you had isn't exactly what your customers need or want. As the saying goes, hold onto the problem and customer tightly, but hold your solution loosely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, **continue to make changes - or 'iterate'**. It’s easy to fall in love with the first thing you build and become blinded by its shortcomings. Resist the temptation to toss it aside and try solving different problems when the going gets tough. Stick with your original user and problem. For example, if you’ve built a screwdriver and it doesn’t work well for a mechanic who needs a screwdriver, don’t start thinking about how it could be a spatula or a brush. Instead, figure out how to make it a better screwdriver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the path to success is all about sticking with your user and their problem, and continually refining your solution until it works impeccably well.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# **Making Your Startup's First Product**\n",
      "\n",
      "The key idea I want you to understand is this: Your startup's first product does not have to be perfect. What it should do, above all else, is to address a real problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've likely heard the term 'MVP', which stands for Minimum Viable Product. It's an important concept in the startup world, so let's recall it simply: Your MVP is a very simple version of your product that you can build quickly, often within a few weeks. It can be as basic as a website landing page and a spreadsheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether your MVP involves software or not, the important thing is to start. Make your MVP very simple, focusing on only a few main things your first users really need. You may want to solve every problem for every user right away, but it's usually smarter to start by addressing a few key issues for a small group of first users. Then, you can add more features later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your MVP is your starting point – it's never the end goal. It's just a base for you to grow from. Don't worry if it seems too simple or not as special as you want. What matters is that it solves a problem and allows you to get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's look at a few examples to help you understand this point better:\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Airbnb**\n",
      "\n",
      "Airbnb is a classic example of a company that started with a very simple MVP. In 2008, their first landing page was quite simple compared to what we see today. How simple? Imagine this: there were no payment options online. If you booked a place on Airbnb, you exchanged money with the host in person! You also couldn't see where the house was located on a map. Despite these shortcomings, they still managed to start their business and iterate on their product.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Another interesting example is Twitch. On its first day, Twitch was known as Justin.tv, and it was a one-channel online reality TV show. The video quality was so low you could hardly see people's faces, let alone any details in their apartment. There were no video games unless the people in the apartment decided to play some. Despite this, today Twitch is a globally popular live streaming platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "These examples show how companies can start small and simple, but with a clear vision and focus on problem-solving, they can grow big and successful. So, when you start your own startup, don't stress over having a perfect product from the start. Just create something that solves a problem, and then keep improving and adding to it over time.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Alright, let's break this down and keep it simple. What's important to notice here is that in the beginning, there weren't any video games around, unless we chose to play video games ourselves in our apartment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now when you think about **Twitch**, it surely has become a lot more complex. We're going to talk about Stripe now. Well, it wasn't called Stripe at the start. They chose a really funky name - \"/dev/payments\". Cool, isn't it? This was the state of Stripe on the first day. No fancy bank deals, just a simple service. I won't get into the details of how they processed payments, but let's just say they did it in a very 'startup' way. One interesting point I want to make is that, if you decided to use Stripe, the founders would actually come to your office to help you integrate it. Isn't that friendly and industrious? A smart way to find and fix problems early, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "The stripped down version of a product that a startup first builds is often known as the **Minimum Viable Product** or **MVP**. The examples I've given you, Twitch and Stripe, these are billion-dollar companies, but their MVPs were really simplistic and bare-bones. Now, I just made up a term called a **'heavy MVP'**. This applies if you're working in fields with lots of rules like insurance or banking, where your MVP will probably have to be a little more sophisticated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does that help paint a clearer picture?\n",

      "\n",
      "Hello everyone, today let's talk about starting a business in areas that are heavily regulated, like insurance, banking, or even tech-centered fields such as drone technology. It's true **it can be more difficult to get started** in these areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you might even be involved in very complex fields, maybe you are trying to build rockets or invent new drugs. These types of businesses, often called 'moonshot' projects, are tough. They're not the kind of things you can easily set up in a few weeks. For example, can you imagine trying to bore tunnels into the earth and replace cars with high-speed vehicles in just a couple of weeks? \n",
      "\n",
      "If you find yourself in these situations, **here's a helpful tip:** you can begin with a basic website. This website can simply explain what you do. It's a great starting point, and having a place where people can get information about your business is extremely valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a simple website like this **can be done in days, not weeks**. In a strange and unexpected way, starting off with a 'heavier' Minimum Viable Product (MVP) like a detailed website could potentially be faster than starting with a 'lean' MVP.\n",

      "# Understanding Launches and Customer Acquisition \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello everyone! Today, we're going to break down a common myth among those looking to kick-start their business. A lot of people see big companies make flashy product launches and think, \"That's what we should do!\" But let's have a hearty chat about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about companies like Facebook. They're well-known, they make headlines, and their launches seem incredibly exciting. Seeing this might make you think, \"That's what success looks like!\" But let's look a bit closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider this - do any of you remember the exact day Google or Facebook, or even Twitter launched? Not really, right? This tells us, launches, in themselves, don't make or break a company. What gives life to your business isn't a one-time, grand launch event. It's something more crucial - your customers!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start using simpler terms. When we say 'launch', let's think of it as the time you start getting customers. And let's call a big, flashy, media-covered event a 'press launch'. Your main focus, especially in the early stages, should be on acquiring customers, not making headlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might learn a lot about your customers through research, but nothing beats giving them a real product. Until they've touched, used, and reviewed what you're offering, you can't confidently say that it meets their needs. This is also a fast check to know if your product does not solve their problems. \n",
      "\n",
      "So here's our main takeaway – spending your time building something for your customers is far more valuable than perfecting a grand pitch deck or working endlessly for a grandiose press launch. Feel free to blur the glamour of press coverage and direct your energy where it matters-the customer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Be eager to learn from your customers. After all, they are the heart of your business!\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Alright, guys, let's dive straight in. Firstly, we're talking about building a **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product), a baby version of your product. It has enough features to satisfy the early users, and you can use the feedback to shape your complete product later on. Our main goal is to build an MVP *fast*. So, here are some friendly tips on how you can achieve that.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Time-box your spec**\n",
      "\n",
      "   What I mean is, draw a time limit for this list of stuff you need to build before you're ready to show your product to the world. Say you decide, \"I want to launch in three weeks.\" Then, the things on your list should only be those you can build within three weeks. This makes everything simpler. It helps you scratch off features you can't build in three weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Write your spec**\n",
      "\n",
      "   This might seem too basic, but trust me, a lot of folks mess this one up. It's very easy to drift from what you're working on because you've not written it down. If you have it in black and white, it helps you stay focused. If you're changing things, you'll at least know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cut your spec**\n",
      "\n",
      "   A week into your work, you might see you've been a little too ambitious with your spec. You can't possibly finish in time. That's okay. Start cutting out stuff that isn't crucial. If everything seems important, start cutting important things too. Remember, the goal is to put *something* out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Don't fall head over heels with your MVP**\n",
      "\n",
      "   It's easy to get very attached to this first version you're creating. But remember, none of those popular products started as we see them now. Your MVP is just step one. Think of it like a paper you wrote in the first grade - you wouldn't frame that, would you? So, don't get too attached; it's all part of a journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that's it for this talk. Always here for any questions you might have. Let's continue creating great things together!\n",
