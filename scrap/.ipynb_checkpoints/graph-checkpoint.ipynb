power\\n167\\nwithin uh down in los angeles uh and so\\n169\\ni i i graciously accepted and i went\\n172\\ndown\\n173\\nand in la i think it was at the staples\\n175\\ncenter or a very large convention center\\n177\\nthere's ten thousand people in the\\n178\\naudience it was crazy it was awesome\\n180\\nand it was a four-day event\\n182\\nand we went through a lot of exercises\\n185\\ngoal setting workshops etc\\n188\\nand then\\n189\\nincluding walking across hot fire coals\\n192\\non the saturday night\\n194\\nand tony conditioned us tony robbins\\n197\\nand i actually ended up meeting him\\n198\\nanother time for business really reasons\\n200\\nreally nice guy but and when i shook his\\n202\\nhand his hand like wrapped around my\\n203\\nhand he's a big dude big dude but a\\n206\\nreally nice guy as well\\n208\\nbut what he did was on the saturday\\n210\\nnight of that four-day event back in\\n213\\n2015\\n215\\nhe\\n216\\nhad us walk across boiling hot coals\\n219\\nlike it looked like lava\\n221\\nand he conditioned us to\\n223\\nbelieve\\n224\\nin our mind that we're not going to feel\\n226\\nany pain at all\\n229\\nhe conditioned us to do that and so i\\n230\\nwalked across the coals\\n232\\nand i didn't feel any pain at all it was\\n234\\nexhilarating and of course i had lots of\\n235\\nfire hoses there just in case whatever i\\n238\\ndidn't feel any pain it was amazing\\n240\\nuh and and i went back to my hotel it\\n243\\nwas actually an airbnb that night uh in\\n244\\nin la\\n246\\nand i um i i couldn't sleep because i\\n249\\nwas excited but also because there's\\n250\\nblisters in my feet and i had to take a\\n252\\nbunch of advil\\n253\\nmy feet were fine though\\n255\\nbut that that event kind of changed me\\n257\\nit really changed me and on the sunday\\n260\\nof that four day event uh what tony\\n262\\nrobbins did was he said that\\n265\\nwrite down your goals\\n266\\nand he then said\\n268\\ni want

believe that the glass is\\n485\\noverflowing\\n487\\nand i really do believe that you know i\\n489\\nalways see the positives in life always\\n491\\nalways always you know what we think we\\n493\\nperceive you know thoughts your thoughts\\n495\\nbecome reality\\n497\\num so um yeah we're 28 through other way\\n500\\nthrough uh this this course right now uh\\n502\\nand so as i mentioned before um we're\\n504\\ngoing to go through this book this book\\n506\\nuh in a lot a lot of detail a lot of\\n508\\ndetail and uh i published this um not\\n512\\nonly on um on on kindle but also amazon\\n515\\nthe print version uh and many of my\\n517\\nstudents uh i'm so happy to hear\\n519\\nuh have started to publish your own\\n520\\nbooks as well and i've got copies in\\n523\\nhere\\n524\\nuh and i also published it on on on\\n527\\naudible.com i went to acx.com and did it\\n530\\nthere and that's the cover of the book\\n532\\nfrom audible and i have the cover of the\\n534\\nbook made by some dude um i can't\\n536\\nremember where he is actually no it was\\n538\\na woman actually actually her name is\\n540\\nultra contu\\n541\\non fiverr.com and she's based in\\n543\\nbangladesh and she's great so she made\\n545\\nthis cover yeah\\n546\\nyeah um and then uh what happened was\\n549\\ni'm humbled to say that uh per this this\\n551\\nvideo here um\\n553\\nit was\\n554\\nforbes wrote an article saying this is\\n556\\none of six books every entrepreneur\\n558\\nshould read right now along with lean\\n559\\nstartup zero to one by peter thiel uh\\n562\\nthe self-made um billionaire effect\\n565\\nstart with why by simon sinek and the\\n567\\nseven habits of highly effective people\\n569\\nby stephen covey i actually went to\\n570\\nbusiness school at columbia with stephen\\n572\\ncovey covey's kit yeah\\n574\\nso this this kind of changed my life uh\\n576\\nthis this book uh and i i was very\\n579\\ntransparent in this book\\n581\\nand i find that it's easier for me uh to\\n584\\nread social media posts or books or\\n586\\narticles if they're very very short when\\n588\\ni was a kid i loved reading books by\\n591\\nroald dahl\\n593\\nhe made james and the giant peach\\n595\\nand charlie in the chocolate factory and\\n597\\nthat influenced me because roald dahl\\n599\\nthat his chapters were very very short\\n601\\nit was just easy for me to to go through\\n603\\nit and that's what i did with this book\\n605\\nhere as well i kept the chapters very\\n607\\nvery short uh and i'm humbled to say\\n610\\nthat it was also the number three\\n612\\nbestseller i think the kindle version\\n613\\nfor a while on on on amazon it's still\\n615\\nit's since trailed off a bunch troll off\\n618\\na bunch yeah\\n619\\nbut i had a lot of fun put this together\\n620\\nso there's 17 sections in the book\\n624\\nand we're going to talk about the book\\n625\\nin two different parts and so as i\\n627\\nmentioned before\\n628\\nthe first half of the book is today's\\n630\\nis in today's workbook we're gonna do\\n632\\nsections one through eight uh and then\\n635\\nnext class um we're gonna do the second\\n638\\nhalf of the book and discuss sections\\n641\\nnine through seventeen okay so let me\\n644\\nshow you what that means so if you go\\n646\\nhere to to the workbook\\n648\\num you'll see here that this is more\\n650\\nthan 50 pages and it might be the page\\n653\\nlink might be a little bit different\\n654\\ndepending on how many notes you take\\n656\\nin this workbook\\n657\\nas well as if you're using it on a\\n659\\ndifferent form factor or pdf version\\n662\\nor the the word version microsoft word\\n664\\nversion but the contents are the same\\n666\\nand so what i'll do is i will ask you to\\n668\\nclick on these numbers\\n670\\nevery now and then to start doing\\n672\\nexercises and i'll make it very very\\n673\\nintuitive to know exactly how to do this\\n675\\nand when as well\\n677\\nand so\\n678\\nyou click here\\n679\\nand then you click down here now\\n681\\nif you can't see a hyperlink here after\\n684\\nyou click this then go up here and just\\n685\\nclick section one two three etc and what\\n688\\ni did also\\n690\\nwas\\n691\\ni put here the table of contents for the\\n693\\nfirst half of the book\\n695\\nand if you're using the microsoft word\\n697\\nversion of this document or the google\\n699\\ndocs version you can click on any of\\n701\\nthese to jump right to these chapters in\\n703\\nin the book\\n704\\num it doesn't work i don't think on the\\n707\\npdf version so just scroll to where you\\n709\\nshould be\\n710\\nso i included actually all of um\\n713\\nall the content of the book the first\\n715\\nhalf at least today and i'll include the\\n716\\nnext half of the book in next class's\\n718\\nworkbook so if you go here to section\\n721\\none\\n722\\ni i talk about here high level what we\\n724\\ncover in section one\\n726\\ni had a lot of fun with 3d images today\\n728\\ntoo\\n729\\nand then if you want you can type your\\n731\\nnotes here\\n732\\nfor lesson number one\\n734\\nand below each\\n736\\nlesson title\\n738\\nis the actual text from the book and\\n740\\ndon't read this\\n741\\nduring class read it during during\\n742\\nhomework or on the side if you want to\\n744\\nit's optional completely\\n746\\nso you can take notes here on on lesson\\n749\\nnumber one if you want to and what\\n750\\nyou've learned\\n753\\nand what you can also do is if you go to\\n755\\nthe next lesson here number two you can\\n758\\ntake notes here again and again there's\\n760\\na text here from that chapter they're\\n762\\nvery short\\n763\\nand you have to read the entire thing\\n765\\nyou can skim it or read another day\\n768\\nall right so let me go back here to the\\n769\\ntop just we're on the same page does\\n772\\nthat work oh yeah good\\n773\\nthere we go good\\n775\\nall right so um as i talk about all 101\\n779\\nlessons in today's class and next class\\n781\\nas well um you can take down notes as i\\n783\\njust showed you\\n785\\nin in the uh\\n787\\nin the workbook you downloaded today\\n789\\nso let's start now with with topic\\n791\\nnumber one\\n793\\nso uh\\n794\\nsection number one uh is called\\n797\\nrelationships are more important than\\n799\\nproduct knowledge um and uh i have a\\n802\\nlittle catch phrase for all all the\\n804\\nsections in the book so the first cache\\n806\\nphrase for section one is crucial\\n807\\nnetworking tips to make you more\\n809\\nsuccessful now\\n810\\nwe've covered a bunch of this before so\\n812\\ni'm just going to go over what we've\\n814\\nalready covered very quickly so i can\\n816\\nfocus much more attention on the new\\n817\\nstuff but it's always important to\\n820\\nre-emphasize what i've taught you before\\n822\\nbecause\\n823\\nrepetition is the mother of all skill\\n826\\nokay so the very first lesson is steve\\n829\\njobs winning strategy uh how to get\\n832\\nanything you want\\n834\\num and and if you're watching the replay\\n835\\ni mean the non-live version of this\\n837\\nlecture uh what you can do if you want\\n839\\nuh is\\n840\\nyou can actually go to um\\n842\\ngo to chapter one here or i should say\\n844\\nuh the uh lesson number one by going\\n847\\nhere\\n848\\nand what you can do is just click on\\n850\\nthis video here to watch a\\n852\\nshort video of steve jobs uh and if you\\n854\\ndon't want to click on this you can just\\n855\\nsearch for three words uh in uh in\\n858\\nyoutube which are steve jobs ask\\n860\\num and\\n862\\nyou will never get anything you want in\\n864\\nlife now if you don't ask\\n867\\nand when we were younger\\n869\\ngrowing up um we were kids\\n872\\nwe asked our parents all the time for\\n875\\nstuff you know like my youngest one\\n877\\ndrives me crazy i love them though he\\n879\\nsays dad can i have some candy i'll say\\n881\\nno\\n882\\nliterally a minute later he'll say can i\\n883\\nask him kenny now\\n885\\nno and then he'll ask again like five\\n887\\nhe's relentless relentless\\n890\\nuh and then what happens is you stop\\n892\\nasking once you've been conditioned to\\n894\\nstop doing that for whatever reason um\\n898\\nand and you can be tactful when you ask\\n900\\nand not overdo it and upset people\\n902\\nobviously but what happens is once we're\\n904\\ndone with high school\\n906\\nfor a lot of us when we go to a\\n907\\nuniversity or or start our first job\\n909\\nwhatever it is\\n911\\nwe don't really ask for anything because\\n913\\nwe learn that if we keep our heads down\\n915\\nand we get good grades\\n917\\nthen everyone's proud of us and life\\n919\\nworks better\\n920\\nbut then what happens is many years into\\n922\\nyour career\\n924\\nyou wake up one day and you look around\\n926\\nand you think to yourself my goodness\\n929\\nwhy are all these other people around me\\n932\\ngetting uh getting promoted\\n934\\nand not me\\n935\\nwhy are all these other less capable\\n937\\npeople\\n938\\naround me getting raises and not me\\n942\\nand you realize and it might be too late\\n944\\nor it's never too late but sometimes it\\n947\\nit takes you to your 40s till you\\n948\\nrealize this\\n950\\nthat if you want a raise or promotion\\n952\\nyou have to ask\\n953\\nnobody's ever made ceo or ever raised a\\n956\\nlot of money as an entrepreneur without\\n959\\nasking over and over and over and over\\n961\\nagain\\n962\\nand do you ever see somebody that is is\\n964\\nkind of average looking\\n967\\nand uh their significant other is\\n970\\nunbelievably attractive\\n972\\nand\\n973\\nyou wonder what's going on\\n976\\nwhy how did that happen and it's not\\n978\\nalways about money okay\\n979\\num it's it's because the the person\\n982\\nthat's less attractive and and we we\\n983\\nrefer to this usually as the matching\\n985\\nprinciple in psychology\\n987\\nyou know people that are they're both\\n988\\nvery good looking usually end up dating\\n991\\nbut there's always\\n993\\nan exception and many exceptions and\\n995\\nit's not just about money\\n998\\nit's about the person who\\n1001\\nis\\n1002\\nmaybe average looking or whatever\\n1004\\njust thinking themselves\\n1006\\ni've got nothing to lose and everything\\n1007\\nto gain i'm going to keep asking people\\n1009\\nout over and over and over again because\\n1011\\ni know\\n1012\\nthat the pain from being rejected a\\n1014\\nbunch of times is nothing\\n1016\\ncompared to the pleasure which is\\n1018\\nmassive\\n1019\\nof being of this person saying yes to a\\n1022\\ndate so to speak you got to be\\n1024\\nrelentless and a lot of entrepreneurs\\n1027\\nare like that as well\\n1028\\nthey're they're relentless they they\\n1030\\nthey just don't stop they're aggressive\\n1033\\nthey're aggressive and and they just\\n1034\\ndon't they really don't care what people\\n1036\\nthink of them either and that's why\\n1037\\nthey're very very successful they don't\\n1039\\ngive a damn what people think yeah\\n1043\\nso\\n1044\\nyou got to be the same way as well sorry\\n1046\\nmy stomach's grambling trembling here i\\n1048\\ngot this new ninja bullet thing and i'm\\n1050\\nit's my new diet here\\n1055\\nkale blueberries etc gives me energy\\n1058\\nso you got to ask\\n1060\\nif you want anything in life you got to\\n1062\\nask over and over and over and over and\\n1064\\nover and over again\\n1066\\nkind of like michael jordan i feel over\\n1068\\nand over and over again and that's why i\\n1070\\nsucceed\\n1071\\ndon't forget that please don't forget\\n1073\\nthat you got to ask\\n1075\\nask often be a pain in the neck and\\n1078\\ndon't give a damn if you get rejected\\n1080\\nwho gives a damn\\n1081\\nyou know jk rowling she you know she she\\n1084\\ngot rejected by like 29 or 30 publishers\\n1087\\nshe didn't give a damn that people\\n1088\\nthought she was a failure who cares\\n1090\\non the 30th they said yes and she's a\\n1092\\nbillionaire now\\n1095\\nall right let's move on now to number\\n1097\\ntwo um how to get a job and why sending\\n1100\\nin a resume can be a waste of time there\\n1103\\nis a better way\\n1105\\nbut even if you have an amazing resume\\n1106\\nand an amazing linkedin profile it's not\\n1108\\nenough\\n1109\\nyou're gonna have to network like crazy\\n1111\\nyou're gonna have to do a ton of\\n1113\\ninformational meetings that's how you\\n1115\\nget jobs in this new digital reality\\n1117\\nthat's just how it works\\n1119\\nbecause if you apply online you're one\\n1121\\nof a thousand people applying for a job\\n1123\\nand the dude that gets the job is\\n1124\\nusually the one that knows somebody at\\n1127\\nthe company\\n1128\\nso and we've covered this a lot before\\n1129\\nso i'm gonna skip over this one here uh\\n1131\\nbut your your your network is your net\\n1133\\nyour your net worth yeah\\n1137\\nall right next up is uh business is\\n1139\\nabout people and not about what you know\\n1142\\num you know a big rookie mistake is\\n1145\\ngoing to any business meeting and just\\n1146\\ntalking about business right away that\\n1148\\ndoesn't matter dude\\n1150\\nit doesn't matter most jobs in the world\\n1152\\nare sales\\n1154\\nand\\n1155\\nmost ceo roles\\n1157\\nyou're a salesperson and if you're a\\n1159\\npartner in a law firm\\n1160\\ndon't be a part of a law firm but if\\n1162\\nyou're a partner in a law firm uh or or\\n1164\\nin a venture capital firm you're a sales\\n1166\\nperson as well\\n1168\\nso how do they do it well they do it by\\n1170\\nbonding and we've talked a lot about\\n1172\\nthis before bond before business\\n1174\\nso business is about people\\n1176\\nand and not what you know it's important\\n1178\\nto reinforce that\\n1180\\nnow\\n1180\\nwhat you have to do also is uh in in i\\n1183\\nknew a guy\\n1184\\nwho is the head of government sales at\\n1187\\nibm in dc\\n1189\\nand i had um i had dinner with him one\\n1192\\nnight with him and with uh mohit aaron\\n1195\\nuh who's the founder of a great company\\n1196\\ncalled cohisti when i was on mohit's\\n1198\\nboard\\n1199\\nand uh it was a great it was a great\\n1201\\ndinner we we had dinner in palo alto and\\n1204\\nbecause this dude\\n1205\\nwas at ibm and in a very senior role\\n1207\\ni asked him you know i said how did you\\n1209\\nget to where you got\\n1211\\nand he talked about how he learned a lot\\n1213\\nfrom working actually in politics and i\\n1216\\nsaid oh what do you mean by that he said\\n1218\\nwell in in the early 90s i worked for\\n1221\\ngeorge bush senior in the white house\\n1224\\nand uh i was like oh my gosh this is\\n1227\\namazing i got to ask you questions\\n1229\\num and so i asked him i said can you\\n1231\\nplease give me\\n1233\\nthe most important lesson you learned\\n1235\\nfrom work in the white house for bush\\n1236\\nsenior why was he successful\\n1240\\nand this guy told me he said it's\\n1242\\nbecause uh\\n1243\\nbush senior would treat people like\\n1245\\ncelebrities and celebrities like people\\n1249\\nso\\n1250\\nif if you ever meet a celebrity or\\n1252\\nsomebody very senior in your company\\n1254\\njust treat like a dream like a normal\\n1255\\nperson they'll feel uncomfortable if you\\n1257\\ntreat me differently\\n1259\\nand if you meet somebody who's not so\\n1261\\nimportant whatever on how you classify\\n1263\\nwhat not so important means\\n1264\\ntreat them like a celebrity as well you\\n1266\\nknow ask a lot of questions ask them a\\n1268\\nlot of questions you know where'd you\\n1270\\ngrow up and that sort of thing and just\\n1273\\njust learn from them just bond\\n1275\\nand don't forget to say people's names\\n1277\\nat least once or twice during during a\\n1279\\nlonger conversation it's more personable\\n1281\\nthat way\\n1282\\nand after you meet with anybody\\n1284\\num connect with them immediately on\\n1286\\nlinkedin as well and just remember their\\n1288\\nname and while you're going off script\\n1289\\nhere but while you're talking to them\\n1291\\nwhat you got to do is\\n1293\\nyou got to visualize and think about\\n1296\\nhow you're going to remember their name\\n1298\\nand so\\n1299\\nuh when i was 19 i actually did the dale\\n1302\\ncarnegie public speaking program\\n1306\\nand\\n1307\\nthere's this woman named uh cynthia\\n1310\\nmustachio\\n1311\\nand i met her once there back when i was\\n1314\\n19 like\\n1315\\nages ago last century\\n1318\\nand her name was cynthia mustachio but i\\n1320\\nremember thinking to myself every time i\\n1322\\nsee her i'm going to think she has a big\\n1324\\nmustache\\n1325\\nand so that's how i remember cynthia\\n1327\\nmustachio\\n1328\\nand you got to do the same thing as well\\n1329\\nwhat you can do is you when you when you\\n1331\\nmeet people because it's really\\n1332\\nembarrassing man like if you go to a a\\n1334\\nparty or something\\n1336\\nand you forget somebody's name\\n1338\\nit's embarrassing to just say hey you\\n1341\\nwhich is what i do sometimes to be\\n1342\\nintellectually honest\\n1344\\nbut what i what i do it's awful for me\\n1346\\nit's the worst for me because my wife's\\n1348\\nname is the same name as me her name is\\n1349\\nchristine i'm chris\\n1351\\nso everybody remembers chris and\\n1352\\nchristine\\n1354\\nand so we go to parties and and i i do\\n1356\\nthis actually this i probably shouldn't\\n1358\\ntell you this trick i'm going there\\n1359\\nanywhere i don't care fully transparent\\n1361\\nas always\\n1362\\nso if christine is beside me at a party\\n1365\\nand there's somebody beside me and i\\n1366\\nhave no idea what their name is i forget\\n1369\\ni go like this i scratch my neck and\\n1371\\nthen christine jumps in and introduces\\n1373\\nherself\\n1374\\nand at the end of the night i've lost\\n1376\\nlike eight layers of skin just kidding\\n1378\\non my neck yeah but it works but you got\\n1380\\nto remember people's names and do name\\n1382\\nassociation as well\\n1384\\nif you can and so when you meet somebody\\n1386\\nif their first name uh is uh similar to\\n1390\\na rock star's name or the same as a rock\\n1392\\nstar's name uh then just think of it\\n1395\\nthat way like if you meet somebody named\\n1397\\nbob\\n1398\\num just just think of bob dylan you know\\n1400\\nsinging a song or in an interview saying\\n1402\\nhey\\n1403\\nyou know you can't really understand it\\n1405\\nbut it's it's silly visualization i get\\n1407\\nit but you'll never forget it yeah yeah\\n1411\\nall right\\n1412\\nall right uh next and and also um\\n1417\\nnot not just rock stars but think of i\\n1419\\nthink of actors as well when you meet\\n1421\\nsomebody or something really really\\n1423\\nsilly really silly like like cynthia\\n1425\\nmustachio\\n1427\\nokay moving on\\n1429\\nall right next up um i want you to meet\\n1431\\npeople have fun and learn and there's no\\n1433\\nreason why i threw in baby yoda here\\n1435\\nother than the fact that i think that\\n1436\\nbaby yoda is adorable\\n1438\\num\\n1440\\nno but in all seriousness um\\n1443\\nwhen i went down to wall street to work\\n1444\\nat goldman i was so nervous man i i was\\n1448\\nnervous because i i thought and i\\n1450\\nremember that time really well i had\\n1452\\nnirvana's song in my head dumb\\n1455\\nnirvana had it\\n1456\\none of the early albums it was great\\n1458\\nthere's a song called dumb\\n1460\\nand it goes i think i'm dumb i think i'm\\n1462\\ndumb and i remember when i was at\\n1463\\ngoldman i remember thinking to myself\\n1466\\nif i don't say anything ever to anybody\\n1469\\nthey might think i'm dumb\\n1471\\nbut if i actually open my mouth and\\n1473\\nstart talking they'll know i'm dumb\\n1475\\nand then the kirk cobain track would go\\n1477\\non and on and on in my head\\n1479\\nperception becomes reality you got to\\n1481\\nget that out of your mind and so i told\\n1483\\nmyself three things which assuaged my\\n1485\\nconcerns you know when i went down and\\n1488\\nin hindsight i would have told myself\\n1489\\nfourth and the fourth thing would have\\n1490\\nbeen god already knows what's gonna\\n1492\\nhappen so just don't worry just enjoy it\\n1495\\ndon't question your faith\\n1497\\nbut the three things i told myself at\\n1498\\nthe time when i went down to goldman um\\n1501\\nwas and i and i loved the power of three\\n1502\\nas you know uh in all my presentations\\n1504\\nand in everything\\n1506\\num\\n1507\\nyou know\\n1507\\nwhat i would say was uh i all i want to\\n1510\\ndo is i want to meet people\\n1511\\nhave fun and learn that's it\\n1515\\nthose are my goals\\n1517\\nthat's it\\n1518\\nand it was great\\n1519\\nbecause i met a ton of people my network\\n1521\\nis amazing partially because of that\\n1523\\ni enjoyed it i had fun i never saw it as\\n1526\\nworks i conditioned myself to enjoy it i\\n1528\\nlearned a ton and once you stop learning\\n1530\\nyou got to move on to another job\\n1533\\nso if you're you're ever nervous about a\\n1536\\nnew job\\n1537\\ndon't worry because when you start a\\n1538\\nbrand new job i don't care how old or\\n1540\\nyoung you are they're not going to give\\n1542\\nyou like mission critical stuff right\\n1543\\naway\\n1544\\nespecially when you're younger you know\\n1546\\nyou're not going to show up first day\\n1548\\nand they're going to say write me a\\n1549\\nproposal on on if ibm should buy red hat\\n1551\\nwhich they already did but you know

      "Hello there, today's chat is about helping businesses take that first big step: launching. I have a different viewpoint on this - one I hope will change your thoughts about launching. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of new business owners stress about their first launch. They think that it has to go perfectly. They believe this is their one and only chance for the public to see their product. They feel if their message isn't just right, customers won't buy their product, use it, or even invest in it. I chat with these owners all the time. They spend months painstakingly readying their launch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the tough reality: for most new businesses, the launch might happen, and it seems like nobody just cares. What's worse, if you spend half a year getting your product ready and no one is interested, your business might be in trouble before you even get another shot at launching.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I'd like to share a more flexible mindset. Just like the commonly known concept of \"always be shipping\", I want you to think of launching as a regular task, not a one-time event. So, let's talk about this new way of thinking, and how we can make it work for you...\n",

      "# When and Why to Launch Your Startup\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello everyone! Today we'll discuss three key points about launching a startup.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When should you launch your startup?\n",
      "2. What makes a good one-line company description?\n",
      "3. What are the different types of startup launches?\n",
      "\n",
      "## When to Launch\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question we're going to tackle is - \"When should I launch?\" The short and simple answer is - as soon as possible! But you might ask, why? Because as founders, we often believe so strongly in our vision that we might end up living in a dream world. We have strong beliefs and theoretical plans. But remember, the world exists beyond our theories. By launching your startup product quickly - even if it's still in a 'rough around the edges' state - you can confirm if you're actually solving a problem people are willing to pay for. This is invaluable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Learning from Early Launches\n",
      "\n",
      "What if you launch too soon? Well, the worst case is not as bad as you think. Maybe people don't like the look of your product, or it's not as polished as it could be. Maybe you're worried that competitors will see it or, worse, maybe no one will pay any attention at all. But here's the thing - even if that happens, that's alright! In fact, Airbnb launched three times before they started getting substantial user attention. A failed launch should not break your determination. Instead, view it as a learning opportunity!\n",
      "\n",
      "What's important is launching, learning, and iterating. Repeat this process until you have developed a product that, even if only a few, users absolutely love. Beneficial words from Paul Buchheit, the creator of Gmail and a long-time partner of YC are priceless in this regard - \"It's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "## Building a User Base\n",
      "\n",
      "Cheer up even if you have just a handful of users, as long as they really love your product. This is crucial. Use their feedback to understand what they love about your product and how you can do more of that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Identifying and delivering what your loyal users love will help you attract more users. Even if you start with just 10 devoted users, you are on the path to success. It might take time, but keep going! \n",
      "\n",
      "In following lectures, we'll dive deeper into creating compelling company descriptions and different kinds of startup launches. Stay tuned!\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# Startup Lecture: Crafting a One-Sentence Pitch\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, everyone! Today we're going to talk about an important part of launching your startup - creating a clear and simple pitch. By this, I mean that you should be able to say what your startup does in just one sentence. \n",
      "\n",
      "Creating such a pitch needs a clear vision. We believe that if you understand your idea deep down, you can explain it in simple words. If you can talk about complex things in a way a five-year-old would understand, you know you're on the right track. This clarity is crucial for growth. The best companies grow naturally because people talk about them. This kind of growth is not expensive and tends to happen quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about it like this: Have you ever heard about a cool new app or tool from a friend? That's exactly what we're talking about. The better you are at explaining what you're doing, the easier it becomes to convince others to work with you, invest in you, or even join your team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spreading the word about your startup doesn't have to be hard. You want it to be easy for anyone - from your grandpa to a stranger at the airport - to talk about what you're doing. This way, your brand can grow quickly. But don't worry if you are not good at this from the start. It takes time and practice, like any skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's look at how you can create a memorable, one-sentence description of your company:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lead with the \"what,\" not the \"why\"**: It might seem strange, but you should tell people what your company does, rather than how you arrived at the idea. For example, the startup \"Pave\" might have explained their inspiration like this: \"Many of my friends are super confused about their stock options.\" Instead, they start with: \"Pave lets companies plan, communicate and benchmark your compensation in real time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid jargon and marketing fluff**: People often add fancy words and phrases to their pitches that don't really mean anything. For example, calling your startup a \"know-how and synergy platform\" doesn't tell people what it does. Plain and straightforward language is the best way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Don't ramble**: Your pitch should be short and sweet. If you go on for too long, people will lose interest. For example, here's a great, concise pitch from Airbnb: \"We built the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms from locals instead of hotels.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating a one-sentence pitch is crucial for communicating your startup to investors, potential team members, and the public. By simplifying your vision into one clear sentence, you make your startup more approachable and easier to share. Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you work at this, the better you'll get. Keep at it and happy pitching!\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# How to Explain Your Startup: The Art of the One-liner\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, when trying to share what your startup does, you might be tempted to use the popular 'X for Y' pattern - you know, like \"Uber for X\" or \"Airbnb for Y\". Questions come up, \"Is it too common? should I go for it?\" Let's dig in to find the answer. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, folks, let's make one thing clear. Each of you must have a simple and crisp one-line description for your startup, which does not rely on the ‘X for Y’ format. However, there are cases where the ‘X for Y’ approach can be a good choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we can consider Paisy, who was part of our earlier YC batch. They might denote themselves as \"Stripe for previous Soviet Union countries\". Yet, they could also be described as \"payment processing for former Soviet countries\". Do you see the difference?\n",
      "\n",
      "And when is it alright to use the 'X for Y' style? Well, let's go back to Paisy. If the founders are talking to folks in Silicon Valley like investors or press, a familiar comparison may make sense. You can opt for the 'X for Y' concept if it's indeed the best way to give a clear picture of your startup in a jiffy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**But wait!** To use this method, you must meet these three rules. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Firstly, X should be a widely known brand.\n",
      "- Secondly, it must be pretty clear why Y wants what X offers.\n",
      "- Lastly, Y should represent a large market.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, a YC startup once presented themselves as \"Buffer for Snapchat\". The problem here was that although Buffer is doing well, not everyone is aware of it. I remember having to search online for what Buffer was. So, in such cases, it's best to simply describe the problem that your startup is trying to solve.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example from the startup school community that works is \"Harkalive is Airbnb for dance and movement classes\". It gives a quick understanding of what Harkalive does. But as easily, you could say \"Harkalive is a marketplace for dance and movement classes”.\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, in summary,** the best one-liners do these:\n",
      "\n",
      "- They tell what you do, the problem you're solving, and for whom you're doing it.\n",
      "- They are simple, don't use complex words or salesy language.\n",
      "- They don’t have a long setup and are short and sweet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you have these points, you are better equipped to create a snappy one-liner that clearly defines your startup. Go on and make your startup easier to understand!\n",

      "# Launch Like a Pro: Making Your Startup Pitch and Launch Successful\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you want to come up with a great one-sentence pitch for your startup and launch it wisely. Don't worry, we've got your back. In the world of startups, continuous and strategic launch is one of the secrets of successful companies. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Why Launch Continuously?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all about learning. By launching your product early, even if it isn't perfect yet, you get to see what works, what doesn't, and how people react to your idea. You may even find out if you're dealing with the right users, because different communication channels will give you different audiences. Now let's dive into some types of launches you can explore.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Understanding Different Types of Launches\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. The Silent Launch\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a must and you can do it while you're at the planning stage. It doesn't need to be anything expensive. At this stage, all you need is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A domain name for your startup\n",
      "- The name of your company\n",
      "- A short description of what you do \n",
      "- A way for users to contact you\n",
      "- A call to action, like a registration for a newsletter\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to give you an idea, a company called 'Lara' launched with only a domain name, a short description and a sign-up option for their waitlist.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Friends and Family Launch\n",
      "\n",
      "At this stage, test your idea on friends and family. You can share a one to two sentence pitch and ask for their feedback. But remember not to stay in this phase for too long because your friends and family may not be the ideal users for your product.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Stranger Launch\n",
      "\n",
      "It's always good to get feedback from potential real users. For instance, when DoorDash was in its early stage, they spent a lot of time talking to store owners and found out that deliveries were a pain for small business owners. They then developed an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to solve that problem. Remember, always be ready to talk to potential customers as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Online Community Launch\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where you introduce your startup to the online communities you are a part of. Y Combinator (YC), an American seed money startup accelerator, has a community platform called 'Bookface' where it's a great place for startups to get some feedback from fellow founders. Different communities have different tones, audiences and interests. So be authentic, study the community, and engage with them genuinely.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Other Types of Launches\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the ones above, there are also other types of launches such as 'Pre-order Launch', where you use platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo to get pre-orders for a physical product. Then there's the 'Waitlist Launch', where you keep users informed with updates while they wait for your actual product.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one thing to note here: Don't count too much on press releases for sustainable growth. They may expose you to early users and investors, but they won't get you to sustained growth. It's better to build your own community during the startup phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Bottom Line\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of launching as not just a one-time event. If your first launch doesn't get much attention, that's perfectly okay. Just take a page from Airbnb's book and launch again and again until you do. Always remember, practice makes perfect in the startup world.\n",

       "{'1.1.1': 'What I want to do\\nin this video is think about the\\norigins of algebra. The origins of\\nalgebra, and the word, especially in association\\nwith the ideas that algebra now represents,\\ncomes from this book, or actually this is a page\\nof the book right over there. The English translation\\nfor the title of this book is the \"Compendious\\nBook on Calculation by Completion and Balancing.\" And it was written by a\\nPersian mathematician who lived in Baghdad\\nin, I believe, it was in the eighth\\nor ninth century. I believe it was actually 820\\nAD when he wrote this book. AD. And algebra is the Arabic word,\\nthat here is the actual title that he gave to it, which\\nis the Arabic title. Algebra means restoration\\nor completion. Restoration or completion. And he associated it in his book\\nwith a very specific operation, really taking something\\nfrom one side of an equation to another side of an equation. But we can actually\\nsee it right over here, and I don\\'t know\\nArabic, but I actually do know some\\nlanguages that seems to have borrowed a\\nlittle bit from Arabic, or maybe it went the\\nother way around. But this says Al-kitab,\\nand I know just enough Urdu and Hindi to understand\\na good India movie, but Al-kitab, kitab means book. So this part is book. Book. Al-mukhtasar, well, I think\\nthat means compendious, because I don\\'t know\\nthe word for compendious and that seems like that. Fihisab, hisab means\\ncalculation in Hindi or Urdu, so this is calculation. Calculation. Al-gabr, this is the root. This is the famous algebra,\\nthis is where it shows up. So this is for completion, you\\ncould view that as completion. Completion. And then wa\\'l-muqabala, and that\\nmeans essentially balancing. Balancing. Completion and balancing. So if we wanted\\nto translate it-- I know this isn\\'t a video\\non translating Arabic, but the book, I guess\\nthis is saying compendious on calculation by\\ncompletion and balancing is the rough translation\\nright over there. But that is the source\\nof the word algebra, and this is a very, very,\\nvery important book. Not just because it was the\\nfirst use of the word algebra, but many people viewed\\nthis book as the first time that algebra took a\\nlot of its modern-- took on many of\\nits modern ideas. Ideas of balancing an equation. The abstract problem\\nitself, not trying to do one off problems\\nhere or there. But al-Khwarizmi was\\nnot the first person, and just to get an idea of\\nwhere all this is happening. So he was hanging\\nout in Baghdad, and this part of\\nthe world shows up a lot in the history of algebra. But he was hanging\\nout right there in around the eighth\\nor ninth century. So let me draw a\\ntime line here, just so we can appreciate everything. So that is timeline,\\nand then whether or not you are religious, most\\nof our modern dates are dependent on the birth of\\nJesus, so that is right there. Maybe I\\'ll put a cross\\nover there to signify that. When we want to\\nbe non-religious, we say the common era. Before the common era, when\\nwe want to be religious we say AD, which means\\nin the year of our lord. I don\\'t know the Latin,\\nAnno Domini, I believe, year of our lord. And then when we want--\\nin the religious context, instead of saying before common\\nera, we say before Christ, BC. But either way, so this\\nis 1000 in the common era. This is 2000 in the common era. And obviously, we are\\nsitting-- at least when I\\'m making this video, I\\'m\\nsitting right about there. And then this is 1000\\nbefore the common era, and this is 2000\\nbefore the common era. So the first traces--\\nand I\\'m skipping out, and really, it\\'s just\\nwhat we can find. I\\'m sure if we were\\nable to dig more, we might be able to\\nfind other evidence of different civilizations\\nand different people stumbling on many of the ideas in algebra. But our first records of\\npeople really exploring the ideas that are\\nhit upon in algebra come from ancient\\nBabylon around 2000 years before the common\\nera, before Christ. So right around there\\nthere are stone tablets where it looks like\\npeople were exploring some of the fundamental\\nideas of algebra. They weren\\'t using\\nthe same symbols. They weren\\'t using the same ways\\nof representing the numbers, but it was algebra that\\nthey were working on. And that was, once again,\\nin this part of the world. Babylon was right about there. And Babylon, it\\'s kind of\\nkept the tradition of Sumeria. This whole region was\\ncalled Mesopotamia, Greek for between two rivers. But that\\'s the first\\ntraces of people that we know of that\\nwhere people were starting to do what we would\\ncall real, real algebra. And then you fast forward. And I\\'m sure we\\'re\\nmissing-- and I\\'m sure even our historians don\\'t know\\nall of the different instances of people using algebra, but the\\nmajor contributions to algebra, we saw it here in\\nBabylon 2000 years ago. And then if we fast\\nforward to about 200 to 300 AD, so right over there,\\nyou have a Greek gentleman who lived in Alexandria. So this is Greece\\nright over here, but he lived in Alexandria,\\nwhich at the time was part of the Roman Empire. So Alexandria is\\nright over here, and he was a gentleman by\\nthe name of Diophantus, or Diophantus. I don\\'t know how to\\npronounce it, Diophantus. And he is sometimes\\ncredited with being the father of algebra,\\nand it\\'s debatable whether it\\'s Diophantus\\nor al-Khwarizmi. al-Khwarizmi, who\\nkind of started using these terms of\\nbalancing equations and talking about\\nmath in a purer way, while Diophantus was more\\nfocused on particular problems. And both of them were\\nkind of beat to the punch by the Babylonians,\\nalthough they all did contribute in their own way. It\\'s not like they\\nwere just copying what the Babylonians did. They had their own\\nunique contributions to what we now consider algebra. But many, especially\\nWestern historians, associate Diophantus as\\nthe father of algebra. And now, al-Khwarizmi\\nis sometimes what other people would argue\\nas the father of algebra, so he made significant\\ncontributions. And if you go to 600 AD-- so\\nif you go to about 600 AD, another famous mathematician\\nin the history of algebra was Brahmagupta, in India. Brahmagupta, in India. So obviously, and\\nactually, I don\\'t know where in India he lived. I should look that\\nup, but roughly in that part of the world. And he also made\\nsignificant contributions. And then you have\\nal-Khwarizmi, who shows up right\\nthere, al-Khwarizmi. And he is the gentleman\\nthat definitely we credit with the name\\nalgebra, comes from Arabic for restoration, and some\\npeople also consider him to be, if not the father of\\nalgebra, although some people say he is the father, he is\\none of the fathers of algebra because he really started\\nto think about algebra in the abstract sense, devoid\\nof some specific problems and a lot of the way\\na modern mathematician would start to think\\nabout the field. ',\n",
       " '1.1.2': \"You will hear me use the word abstract a lot so i thought i would actually give you an attempt at a definition, or maybe even more important an intuition of what abstract means and abstract can be an adjective you can have an abstract idea you can have abstract art or it can be a verb you can abstract something abstract the idea from some other idea and you can even have it as a noun you can have an abstract and it tends to, if you use it as a noun the one I tend to associate is the abstract of research paper, which is kind of, distills the essence of the research paper, which is kind of a summary of that paper and the one thing you are going to see regardless of how you what context you use the word abstract there's this kind of notion taking the essence of a real world object whether you use it as a noun, adjective, or a verb so over here we have our real world we have our real world and then over here you have your world of you have ideas and concepts and the general idea behind the abstraction or abstracting something is that you're taking it away from the particular concrete real world and you're going more into the direction of ideas and concepts and probably for me, one of the most tangible ways of thinking about abstraction, which is kind of a contradiction in itself to think of abstraction in a tangible way is things like geometric shapes so if i were to tell you to find me some cubes you might point to a borg vessel right over there a borg vessel you might point to a pair of dice let me draw a pair of dice if you were looking for cubes so you might point to a pair of dice that looks something like that you might point to a Rubik's cube anything you might find there might be a building that looks like a cube it might be a building that looks like a cube or maybe there is a box in your house that is a cube but in your mind you have a general idea of what a cube is like i know a cube when i see one and a general idea is distilling the concept the idea of what a cube is and all of these ideas are very different this is some plastic thing i could hold in my hand these are these white things they aren't even geometrically close to being perfect they have these little divets on the side right over there this is a large borg vessel that you know that doesn't exist yet is a fictional thing that they all have this cubeness to them one of the fun things about geometry so really distill the essence of these real world shapes and we do have this definition in geometry which is an object like this where every side has the exact same length so this is length one and that would be length one that would be length one it doesn't have to be whatever the length of this side is and this dimension then this dimension would be that length and then that dimension is going to be that length and i'm not giving you the rigorous definition but i'm just trying to highlight that there is pure idea of what a cube is of what a cube is and the real world, there is nothing that is actually a perfect cube if you were to get really really close to the die if you were to measure exactly their measurements they won't be exactly the same measurement but the abstract idea is completely the same length as this and this and this and all of the edges are going to have the exact same length so this is going from the concrete the specific from the real world if you consider the 24th or the 25th century, the real world to going to the idea behind it, the general idea and you probably also heard the word abstract in terms of art, like abstract art so this is abstract art and it is the same general idea so if you to look it up in the dictionary you're going to find 20 definitions of the word abstract but it's all, essentially trying to say the same thing abstract art is art that is not focused on trying to paint reality the exact way reality exists if you look at kind of lot of Renaissance art they are skilled at painting figures exactly how they look in the real world but the abstract artist sometimes they're not even trying to represent anything from the real world they are trying to represent a raw idea or a raw expression of color and form and texture and this is a Jackson Pollock painting right over here and i printed out so many things wrong taken by our own Steven Zucker, our art historian and you can see that it's not clear Jackson Pollock is not trying to paint a you know, a dog or horse or anything like that he is painting something that is devoid completely independent of anything that we actually see in physical reality and the word, abstraction, you know, it doesn't just apply on just a pure geometry and art it applies to almost everything we do on a daily basis when we even talk about things when we even use words or use symbols we are essentially abstracting away we're abstracting the essence of something that actually exists in physical reality so if i use the word dog it is a set of symbols that represent something in our mind that we associate with dog we have in our minds kind of the quality of what a dog actually is you know, it has four legs and floppy ears and you enjoy petting it and they're man's or i guess people's best friend you imagine this thing called a dog and it has the essence of dog and when you actually look at dogs in the real world they look very very different type of animals like when you look at a great dane or kind of a super small poodle But we recognize there is an essence of those particulars that we can abstract away and say this is a dog and we abstract it even more by representing these letter symbols that tend to conjure up this image even when we write something as simple as a number so if i write the number five we use it so frequently that to us a number 5 seems kind of like a concrete thing but it 's so abstract it's just a quantity of things i can symbolize like that i could have symbolized 5 like that i could have symbolized 5 in roman numerals like that i could symbolize it like that and in all of these cases they are it is the idea of a quantity of five things five, you know, you could say point me to a five and someone could draw or point you to something like that but they are still pointing you to the symbol of five but it's still an very abstract idea so hopefully this gives you an appreciation for what abstract means as you can tell, you know it's kind of a, for lack of a better word it's kind of an abstract idea not to be too cute about that \",\n",
       " '1.1.3': 'Before we get into\\nthe meat of algebra, I wanted to give you a quote\\nfrom one of the greatest minds in human history, Galileo\\nGalilei, because I think this quote encapsulates\\nthe true point of algebra and really mathematics\\nin general. He said, \"Philosophy is written\\nin that great book which ever lies before our eyes--\\nI mean the universe-- but we cannot understand\\nit if we do not first learn the language and grasp the\\nsymbols in which is written. This book is written in\\nthe mathematical language, without which one wanders in\\nvain through a dark labyrinth.\" So very dramatic, but very deep. And this really is the\\npoint of mathematics. And what we\\'ll see as we start\\ngetting deeper and deeper into algebra is that we\\'re going\\nto start abstracting things, and we\\'re going to start\\ngetting to core ideas that start explaining really how\\nthe universe is structured. Sure, these ideas can be\\napplied to things like economics and finance and\\nphysics and chemistry. But at their core,\\nthey\\'re the same idea, and so they\\'re even more\\nfundamental, more pure, than any one of\\nthose applications. And to see what I mean by\\ngetting down to the root idea, let\\'s go with a-- I guess we\\nstarted with the very grand, the philosophy of\\nthe universe is written in mathematics--\\nbut let\\'s start with a very concrete,\\nsimple idea. But we\\'ll keep\\nabstracting, and we\\'ll see how the same idea\\nconnects across many domains in our universe. So let\\'s just say\\nwe\\'re at the store, and we\\'re going\\nto buy something. And there is a sale. The sale says that it\\nis 30% percent off, and I\\'m interested. I don\\'t shop at\\ntoo fancy a store. So let\\'s say I\\'m interested\\nin a pair of pants. And the pair of pants before\\nthe sale even is about $20. And that is about how\\nmuch I spend on my pants. So I\\'m interested in\\na $20 pair of pants. But it\\'s even better, there\\'s\\na 30% off sale on these pants. Well, how would I\\nthink about how much I\\'m going to get\\noff of that $20? And this isn\\'t algebra yet. This is something that you\\'ve\\nprobably had exposure to. You would multiply\\nthe 30% times the $20. So you would say your\\ndiscount is equal to-- you could write\\nit as 30% times $20. I\\'ll do the $20 in purple. Or you could write it, if\\nyou wanted to write this as a decimal, you could\\nwrite this as 0.30 times $20. And if you were to do the\\nmath, you would get $6. So nothing new over there. But what if I want to\\ngeneralize it a little bit? That\\'s the discount on this\\nparticular pair of pants. But what if I wanted to know\\nthe discount on anything in the store? Well, then I could\\nsay, well, let x be the price-- let me do\\nthis in a different color. So I\\'m just going\\nto make a symbol. Let x be the price\\nof the product I want to buy, price,\\nthe non-discount price of the product in the store. So now, all of a\\nsudden, we can say that our discount is\\nequal to 30% times x. Or if we wanted to\\nwrite it as a decimal, if we wanted to write\\n30% as a decimal, we could write 0.30 times x. Now, this is interesting. Now you give me the price\\nof any product in the store, and I can substitute\\nit in for x. And then I can essentially\\nmultiply 0.3 times that, and I would get the discount. So now we\\'re starting\\nto, very slowly, we\\'re starting to get into\\nthe abstraction of algebra. And we\\'ll see that these will\\nget much more nuanced and deep and, frankly, more\\nbeautiful as we start studying more and more\\nkind of algebraic ideas. But we aren\\'t done here. We can abstract this even more. Over here, we\\'ve said\\nwe\\'ve generalized this for any product. We\\'re not just saying\\nfor this $20 product. If there\\'s a $10 product, we\\ncan put that $10 product in here for x. And then we would\\nsay 0.30 times 10, and the discount would be $3. It might be $100 product, then\\nthe discount would be $30. But let\\'s generalize even more. Let\\'s say, well, what is\\nthe discount for any given sale when the sale is\\na certain percentage? So now we can say\\nthat the discount-- let me define a variable. So let\\'s let m equal-- or I\\'ll\\nsay p just so it makes sense. p is equal to the\\npercentage off. Now what can we do? Well, now we can say\\nthat the discount is equal to the percentage off. In these other examples,\\nwe were picking 30%. But we can say now it\\'s p. It\\'s the percentage off. It\\'s p. That\\'s the percentage off\\ntimes the product in question, times the price, the\\nnon-discount price of the product in question. Well, that was x. The discount is\\nequal to p times x. Now, this is really interesting. Now we have a general\\nway of calculating a discount for any given\\npercentage off and any given product x. And we didn\\'t have to use\\nthese words and these letters. We could have said let\\ny equal the discount. Then we could have written\\nthe same underlying idea. Instead of writing\\ndiscount, we could have written y is equal to\\nthe percentage off p times the non-discount price\\nof the product, times x. And you could have defined these\\nletters any way you wanted. Instead of writing\\ny there, you could have written a\\nGreek letter, or you could have written\\nany symbol there. As long as you can\\nkeep track of it, that symbol represents the\\nactual dollar discount. But now things get\\nreally interesting. Because we can use this type\\nof a relationship, which is an equation--\\nyou\\'re equating y to this right over here, that\\'s\\nwhy we call it an equation-- this can be used for\\nthings that are completely unrelated to the price,\\nthe discount price, at the store over here. So in physics,\\nyou\\'ll see that force is equal to mass\\ntimes acceleration. The letters are different,\\nbut these are fundamentally the same idea. We could\\'ve let y is equal to\\nforce, and mass is equal to p. So let me write p\\nis equal to mass. And this wouldn\\'t be an\\nintuitive way to define it, but I want to show\\nyou that this is the same idea, the\\nsame relationship, but it\\'s being applied to two\\ncompletely different things. And we could say x is\\nequal to acceleration. Well, then the famous force\\nis equal to mass times acceleration can be rewritten. And it\\'s really\\nthe same exact idea as y, which we\\'ve\\ndefined as force, can be equal to\\nmass, which we\\'re going to use the\\nsymbol p, which is equal to p times acceleration. And we\\'re just going to happen\\nto use the letter x here, times x. Well, this is the\\nexact same equation. This is the exact same equation. And we could see that we\\ncan take this equation, and it can apply to\\nthings in economics, or it can apply to\\nthings in finance, or it can apply to things in\\ncomputer science, or logic, or electrical engineering,\\nor anything, accounting. There\\'s an infinite\\nnumber of applications of this one equation. And what\\'s neat\\nabout mathematics and what\\'s neat about\\nalgebra in particular is we can focus on\\nthis abstraction. We can focus on\\nthe abstract here, and we can manipulate\\nthe abstract here. And what we discover\\nfrom these ideas, from these\\nmanipulations, can then go and be reapplied to all\\nof these other applications, to all of them. And even neater, it\\'s\\nkind of telling us the true structure\\nof the universe if you were to strip away all\\nof these human definitions and all of these\\nhuman applications. So for example, we could say,\\nlook, if y is equal to p times x-- so literally, if someone\\nsaid, hey, this is y, and someone says, on the\\nother hand, I have p times x, I could say, well, you\\nhave the same thing in both of your hands. And if you were to divide\\none of them by a number, and if you wanted them\\nto still be equal, you would divide the\\nother one by that number. So for example, we know that\\ny is equal to p times x. Well, what if you wanted\\nto have them both be equal? And you say, well,\\nwhat is y divided by x going to be equal to? Well, y was equal to p\\ntimes x, so y divided by x is going to be\\nthe same thing as p times x divided by x. But now this is interesting. Because p times x\\ndivided by x-- well, if you multiply by something and\\nthen divide by that something, it\\'s just you\\'re going to\\nget your original number. If you multiply by\\n5 and divide by 5, you\\'re just going to start with\\np or whatever this number is. So those would cancel out. But we were able to manipulate\\nthe abstraction here and get y over x is equal to p-- and\\nlet me make that x green. And now this has implications\\nfor every one of these ideas. One is telling us\\na fundamental truth about the universe,\\nalmost devoid of any of these applications. But now we can go and take\\nthem back to any place that we applied. And the really\\ninteresting thing is we\\'re going to find there\\nare an infinite number of applications,\\nand we don\\'t even know, frankly, most of them. We\\'re going to discover new ones\\nfor them in a thousand years. And so hopefully this\\ngives you a sense for why Galileo said\\nwhat he said about really mathematics is really the\\nlanguage with which we can understand the philosophy\\nof the universe. And that\\'s why people tell us\\nthat if a completely alien life form were to ever\\ncontact humans, mathematics would probably\\nbe our first common ground, the place that we can start\\nto form a basis that we can start to communicate from. ',\n",
       " '1.1.4': \"I'm here with Jesse Ro, whose a math teacher at Summit San Jose and a Khan Academy teaching fellow and you had some interesting ideas or questions. Yeah, one question that students ask a lot when they start Algebra is why do we need letters, why can't we just use numbers for everything? Why letters? So why do we have all these Xs and Ys and Zs and ABCs when we start dealing with Algebra? Yeah, exactly. That's interesting, well why don't we let people think about that for a second. So Sal, how would you answer this question? Why do we need letters in Algebra? So why letters. So there are a couple of ways I'd think about it. One is if you have an unknown. So if I were to write X plus three is equal to ten the reason why we're doing this is that we don't know what X is It's literally an unknown. And so we're going to solve for it in some way. But it did not have to be the letter X. We could have literally written blank plus three is equal to ten. Or we could have written Question Mark plus three is equal to ten. So it didn't have to be letters, but we needed some type of symbol. It literally could've been Smiley Face plus three is equal to ten. But until you know it, you need some type of a symbol to represent whatever that number is. Now we can go and solve this equation and then know what that symbol represents. But if we knew it ahead of time, it wouldn't be an unknown. It wouldn't be something that we didn't know. So that's one reason why I would use letters and where just numbers by itself wouldn't be helpful. The other is when you're describing relationships between numbers. So I could do something like - I could say - that whenever you give me a three, I'm going to give you a four. And I could say, if you give me a five, I'm going to give you a six. And i could keep going on and on forever. If you give me a 7.1, I'm going to give you an 8.1. And I could keep listing this on and on forever. Maybe you could give me any number, and I could tell you what I'm going to give you. But I would obviously run out of space and time if I were to list all of them. And we could do that much more elegantly if we used letters to describe the relationship. Maybe what you give me we call X, and what I give you we call Y. And so I say, look, whatever you give me, I'm going to add one to it. And that's what I'm going to give back to you. And so now, this very simple equation here can describe an infinite number of relationships between X or an infinite number of corresponding Ys and Xs. So now someone knows whatever X you give me you give me three, I add one to it, and I'm going to give you four. You give me 7.1, I'm going to add one to it and give you 8.1. So there is no more elegant way that you could've done it than by using symbols. With that said, I didn't have to use Xs and Ys. This is just a convention that kind of comes to use from history. I could've defined what you give me as Star and what I give you as Smiley Face and this also would've been a valid way to express this. So the letters are really just symbols. Nothing more. \",\n",
       " '1.1.5': 'This right here is a\\npicture of Rene Descartes. Once again, one\\nof the great minds in both math and philosophy. And I think you\\'re seeing\\na little bit of a trend here, that the great\\nphilosophers were also great mathematicians\\nand vice versa. And he was somewhat of a\\ncontemporary of Galileo. He was 32 years younger,\\nalthough he died shortly after Galileo died. This guy died at a\\nmuch younger age. Galileo was well into his 70s. Descartes died at what\\nis only 54 years old. And he\\'s probably most known in\\npopular culture for this quote right over here, a\\nvery philosophical quote. \"I think,\\ntherefore I am.\" But I also wanted to throw in,\\nand this isn\\'t that related to algebra, but I just thought\\nit was a really neat quote, probably his least famous\\nquote, this one right over here. And I like it just because\\nit\\'s very practical, and it makes you realize\\nthat these great minds, these pillars of\\nphilosophy and mathematics, at the end of the day, they\\nreally were just human beings. And he said, \"You\\njust keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake\\nthat could be made. But I just kept pushing.\" Which I think is very,\\nvery good life advice. Now, he did many things in\\nphilosophy and mathematics. But the reason why\\nI\\'m including him here as we build our\\nfoundations of algebra is that he is the\\nindividual most responsible for a very strong connection\\nbetween algebra and geometry. So on the left over here, you\\nhave the world of algebra, and we\\'ve discussed\\nit a little bit. You have equations\\nthat deal with symbols, and these symbols\\nare essentially they can take on values. So you could have something\\nlike y is equal to 2x minus 1. This gives us a relationship\\nbetween whatever x is and whatever y is. And we can even set up a table\\nhere and pick values for x and see what the\\nvalues of y would be. And I could just pick\\nrandom values for x, and then figure out what y is. But I\\'ll pick relatively\\nstraightforward values just so that the math\\ndoesn\\'t get too complicated. So for example, if\\nx is negative 2, then y is going to\\nbe 2 times negative 2 minus 1, which is negative 4\\nminus 1, which is negative 5. If x is negative\\n1, then y is going to be 2 times negative\\n1 minus 1, which is equal to-- this is negative\\n2 minus 1, which is negative 3. If x is equal to 0, then y is\\ngoing to be 2 times 0 minus 1. 2 times 0 is 0 minus\\n1 is just negative 1. I\\'ll do a couple more. And I could have\\npicked any values here. I could have said,\\nwell, what happens if x is the negative\\nsquare root of 2, or what happens if x is\\nnegative 5/2, or positive 6/7? But I\\'m just picking\\nthese numbers because it makes the\\nmath a lot easier when I try to figure out\\nwhat y is going to be. But when x is 1, y is going\\nto be 2 times 1 minus 1. 2 times 1 is 2 minus 1 is 1. And I\\'ll do one more. I\\'ll do one more in a color\\nthat I have not used yet. Let\\'s see, this purple. If x is 2, then y is\\ngoing to be 2 times 2-- now our x is 2-- minus 1. So that is 4 minus\\n1 is equal to 3. So fair enough. I just kind of sampled\\nthis relationship. I said, OK, this describes\\nthe general relationship between a variable\\ny and a variable x. And then I just made it a\\nlittle bit more concrete. I said, OK, well, then\\nfor each of these values of x, what would be the\\ncorresponding value of y? And what Descartes\\nrealized is is that you could visualize this. One, you could visualize\\nthese individual points, but that could also\\nhelp you, in general, to visualize this relationship. And so what he\\nessentially did is he bridged the worlds\\nof this kind of very abstract, symbolic algebra\\nand that and geometry, which was concerned with\\nshapes and sizes and angles. So over here you have\\nthe world of geometry. And obviously, there are people\\nin history, maybe many people, who history may have forgotten\\nwho might have dabbled in this. But before Descartes,\\nit\\'s generally viewed that geometry\\nwas Euclidean geometry, and that\\'s essentially the\\ngeometry that you studied in a geometry class in\\neighth or ninth grade or 10th grade in a traditional\\nhigh school curriculum. And that\\'s the\\ngeometry of studying the relationships between\\ntriangles and their angles, and the relationships between\\ncircles and you have radii, and then you have triangles\\ninscribed in circles, and all the rest. And we go into some depth in\\nthat in the geometry playlist. But Descartes\\nsaid, well, I think I can represent this visually\\nthe same way that you could with studying these\\ntriangles and these circles. He said, well, if we\\nview a piece of paper, if we think about a\\ntwo-dimensional plane, you could view a\\npiece of paper as kind of a section of a\\ntwo-dimensional plane. And we call it two\\ndimensions because there\\'s two directions that\\nyou could go in. There\\'s the up/down direction. That\\'s one direction. So let me draw that. I\\'ll do it in blue because we\\'re\\nstarting to visualize things, so I\\'ll do it in\\nthe geometry color. So you have the\\nup/down direction. And you have the\\nleft/right direction. That\\'s why it\\'s called\\na two-dimensional plane. If we\\'re dealing in\\nthree dimensions, you would have an\\nin/out dimension. And it\\'s very easy to do\\ntwo dimensions on the screen because the screen\\nis two dimensional. And he, says, well, you know,\\nthere are two variables here, and they have this relationship. So why don\\'t I associate\\neach of these variables with one of these\\ndimensions over here? And by convention, let\\'s make\\nthe y variable, which is really the dependent variable--\\nthe way we did it, it depends on what x is-- let\\'s\\nput that on the vertical axis. And let\\'s put our\\nindependent variable, the one where I just\\nrandomly picked values for it to see what y\\nwould become, let\\'s put that on the horizontal axis. And it actually\\nwas Descartes who came up with the convention of\\nusing x\\'s and y\\'s, and we\\'ll see later z\\'s, in\\nalgebra so extensively as unknown variables\\nor the variables that you\\'re manipulating. But he says, well, if we\\nthink about it this way, if we number these\\ndimensions-- so let\\'s say that in the x direction,\\nlet\\'s make this right over here is negative 3. Let\\'s make this negative 2. This is negative 1. This is 0. Now, I\\'m just numbering\\nthe x direction, the left/right direction. Now this is positive 1. This is positive 2. This is positive 3. And we could do the\\nsame in the y direction. So let\\'s see, so this could be,\\nlet\\'s say this is negative 5, negative 4, negative\\n3, negative-- actually, let me do it a little\\nbit neater than that. Let me clean this\\nup a little bit. So let me erase this\\nand extend this down a little bit so I can go all\\nthe way down to negative 5 without making it\\nlook too messy. So let\\'s go all\\nthe way down here. And so we can number it. This is 1. This is 2. This is 3. And then this could be\\nnegative 1, negative 2. And these are all\\njust conventions. It could have been\\nlabeled the other way. We could\\'ve decided to put\\nthe x there and the y there and make this the\\npositive direction and make this the\\nnegative direction. But this is just the\\nconvention that people adopted starting with Descartes. Negative 2, negative 3,\\nnegative 4, and negative 5. And he says, well, I\\nthink I can associate each of these pairs of values\\nwith a point in two dimensions. I can take the x-coordinate, I\\ncan take the x value right over here, and I say, OK,\\nthat\\'s a negative 2. That would be right over there\\nalong the left/right direction. I\\'m going to the left\\nbecause it\\'s negative. And that\\'s associated\\nwith negative 5 in the vertical direction. So I say the y\\nvalue is negative 5, and so if I go 2 to\\nthe left and 5 down, I get to this point\\nright over there. So he says, these two values,\\nnegative 2 and negative 5, I can associate it with\\nthis point in this plane right over here, in this\\ntwo-dimensional plane. So I\\'ll say that point has\\nthe coordinates, tells me where to find that point,\\nnegative 2, negative 5. And these coordinates are\\ncalled Cartesian coordinates, named for Rene\\nDescartes because he\\'s the guy that came up with these. He\\'s associating, all of a\\nsudden, these relationships with points on a\\ncoordinate plane. And then he said, well,\\nOK, let\\'s do another one. There\\'s this other\\nrelationship, where I have when x is\\nequal to negative 1, y is equal to negative 3. So x is negative\\n1, y is negative 3. That\\'s that point\\nright over there. And the convention\\nis, once again, when you list the\\ncoordinates, you list the x-coordinate,\\nthen the y-coordinate. And that\\'s just what\\npeople decided to do. Negative 1, negative\\n3, that would be that point right over there. And then you have the point\\nwhen x is 0, y is negative 1. When x is 0 right\\nover here, which means I don\\'t go to the left\\nor the right, y is negative 1, which means I go 1 down. So that\\'s that point\\nright over there, 0, negative 1, right over there. And I could keep doing this. When x is 1, y is 1. When x is 2, y is 3. Actually, let me do it in\\nthat same purple color. When x is 2, y is 3, 2 comma 3. And then this one right over\\nhere in orange was 1 comma 1. And this is neat by itself. I essentially just\\nsampled possible x\\'s. But what he realized\\nis, not only do you sample these possible\\nx\\'s, but if you just kept sampling x\\'s, if you\\ntried sampling all the x\\'s in between, you would actually\\nend up plotting out a line. So if you were to\\ndo every possible x, you would end up getting a\\nline that looks something like that right over there. And any relation, if you\\npick any x and find any y, it really represents\\na point on this line. Or another way to think about\\nit, any point on this line represents a solution to this\\nequation right over here. So if you have this\\npoint right over here, which looks like it\\'s about\\nx is 1 and 1/2, y is 2. So me write that, 1.5 comma 2. That is a solution\\nto this equation. When x is 1.5, 2 times\\n1.5 is 3 minus 1 is 2. That is right over there. So all of a sudden,\\nhe was able to bridge this gap or this relationship\\nbetween algebra and geometry. We can now visualize\\nall of the x and y pairs that satisfy this\\nequation right over here. And so he is responsible\\nfor making this bridge, and that\\'s why the\\ncoordinates that we use to specify these points are\\ncalled Cartesian coordinates. And as we\\'ll see, the first\\ntype of equations we will study are equations of\\nthis form over here. And in a traditional\\nalgebra curriculum, they\\'re called linear equations. And you might be saying,\\nwell, OK, this is an equation. I see that this\\nis equal to that. But what\\'s so linear about them? What makes them\\nlook like a line? And to realize why\\nthey are linear, you have to make this jump\\nthat Rene Descartes made, because if you were to plot\\nthis using Cartesian coordinates on a Euclidean plane,\\nyou will get a line. And in the future,\\nwe\\'ll see that there\\'s other types of equations where\\nyou won\\'t get a line, where you\\'ll get a curve or something\\nkind of crazy or funky. ',\n",
       " '1.2.1': \"Let's say that I'm\\nworking in a restaurant, and I'm making $10 per hour. But on top of my hourly wage,\\nI also get tips each hour. So this entire expression,\\nyou can view this as how much I might\\nmake in a given hour. Now, you might also realize\\nthat the number of tips or the amount of tips\\nI might make in an hour can change dramatically\\nfrom hour to hour. It can vary-- one hour it\\nmight be lunchtime, get a lot of tips, people might\\nget some big-ticket items. The next hour, I might\\nnot have any customers. And then my tips\\nmight be really low. So the tips part\\nright over here, we consider that--\\nthe entire word, we consider that\\nto be a variable. From scenario to\\nscenario, it can change. So for example, in one\\nscenario, maybe it's lunchtime. I'm getting really big tips. So tips is-- let's\\nsay it's equal to $30. And so the total amount I\\nmight make in that hour-- we can go back to this\\nexpression right over here-- it's going to be 10 plus--\\ninstead of writing tips here, I'll write 30 because that's\\nwhat my tips are in that hour. And so that is going\\nto be equal to 40. Let me do it in\\nthat yellow color. It's going to be equal to $40. But let's say right after that,\\nthe restaurant slows down. We're out of the lunch\\nhour for whatever reason. Maybe the restaurant next door\\nhas a big sale or something. And so the next hour, my\\ntips go down dramatically. My tips go down to\\n$5 for that hour. Now I go back to\\nthis expression. The total I make\\nis my hourly wage plus the $5 in tips,\\nwhich is equal to $15. As you see, this entire\\nexpression-- the 10 plus tips-- it changed depending on what the\\nvalue of the variable tips is. Now, you won't see whole\\nwords typically used in algebra as variables. We get lazy. And so instead, we tend to use\\njust easier-to-write symbols. And so in this context,\\ninstead of writing tips, maybe we could have\\njust written 10 plus t, where t represents the tips\\nthat we get in an hour. And so then we\\nwould say, OK, what happens when t is equal to 30? Well, then, we have a situation. t is equal to 30. This evaluates to 10 plus\\n30, which would be 40. What would happen\\nif t is equal to 5? Well, then, this would\\nevaluate to 10 plus 5, which is equal to 15. Now, I want to be clear. We didn't even have to use t. We didn't even really\\nhave to use a letter, although in traditional algebra,\\nyou almost do use a letter. We could have written\\nit as 10 plus x, where x is your tips per hour.\\nx might not be as natural. It's not the first\\nletter in the word tips. Or you could have even\\nwritten 10 plus star, where you could\\nsay star represents the number of tips in an hour. But it just might have not\\nmade as much intuitive sense. But hopefully this\\ngives you a general idea of just what a variable is. All it is is a symbol that\\nrepresents varying values. And that's why we\\ncall it a variable. \",\n",
       " '1.2.2': 'We now hopefully know a little about variables and as we covered in the last video, a variable can be really any symbol, although we typically use letters because we\\'re used to writing and typing letters. But it can be anything from an x, to a y, a z, an a, a b, and oftentimes we start using greek letters like theta. But you can really use any symbol to say Hey, this is going to vary You can take on multiple values But out of all of all of these The one that is most typically used in algebra Or really in all of mathematics is the variable \"x\" Although all of these are used to some degree But given that x is used so heavily it does introduce a slight problem. And that problem is that it looks a lot like the multiplication symbol Or the one that we use in arithmetic So in arithmetic if I want to write 2 x 3 I literally write \"2 x 3\" But now that we are starting to use variables, if I want to write \"2 times x\" Well if I use this as the multiplication symbol it would be 2 times x And the times symbol and the X look awfully similar and if I\\'m not really careful with my penmanship it can get very confusing. Is this \"Two x x\"? Is this \"two times times something\"? What exactly is going on here? And because this is confusing, This, right over here, is extremely confusing And it can be misinterpreted, We tend not to use this multiplication symbol When we are doing algebra Instead of that, to represent multiplication, We have several options. Instead of writing two times x this way, we could write 2 dot x. And this dot, I want to be very clear, This is not a decimal This is just written a little bit higher And we write this so we don\\'t get confusion in between this and one of these variables right here. But this can really be interpreted as \"2 times x\" So for example, if someone says 2 dot x, when x is equal to 3, well this would be the same thing as two times three, when x is equal to three. Another way you could write it is You could write \"2\" and then you could write the x in parentheses right next to it. This is also interpreted as 2 times x Once again, so in this situation If \"x\" were seven, this would be two times seven, or fourteen And the most traditional way of doing it is to just write the x right after the 2. And sometimes this will be read as \"2x\" But this literally does mean \"Two times x\" And you might say, how come we didn\\'t always do that? Well it would be literally confusing if we did it over here. Instead of writing \"2 times 3\" And wrote \"2 3\" Well, that looks like \"23\". This doesn\\'t look like two times three And this is why we never did it. But here, since we\\'re using a letter now, It\\'s clear that this isn\\'t a part of that number. This isn\\'t \"twenty something\" This is two times this variable x. So all of these are really the same expression. Two times x, two times x, and two times x. And so with that out of the way Let\\'s try some few worked examples, a few practice problems And this will hopefully prepare you for the next exercise Where you\\'ll get a lot of chances to practice this. So if I where to say \"what is 10 minus three y\" And what does this equal when \"y\" is equal to two Well, every time you see the \"y\" You\\'d want that 2 there So this is y is equal to 2. Let\\'s set that y equal to two This is the same thing as 10 minus three times two You do the multiplication first. Multiplication takes precedence in order of operations So three times two is six, Ten minus six is equal to four. Let\\'s do another one. Let\\'s say we had \"7x minus 4\" And we want to evaluate that when when x is equal to three. Where we see the x, we want to put the 3 there So this is the same thing as \"7 times 3\" And I\\'ll actually use this notation, so seven times three minus four. And once again, multiplication takes precedence by order of operations, over addition or subtraction So we want to do the multiplying first 7 times 3 is 21 21 minus 4 is equal to 17. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of background, and I really encourage you to try the next exercise, It will give you a lot of practice on being to evaluate expressions like this. ',\n",

Evaluate the expression when t\\nis equal to 1, t is equal to 8, and t is equal to 10. So let's first\\ntake the situation where t is equal to 1. Then this expression\\nright over here becomes-- and I'll use that\\nsame color-- becomes 5 times 1. 5 times 1 plus 3. 5 times 1 plus 3, and we know\\nfrom order of operations, you do the multiplication\\nbefore you do the addition. So this will be 5\\ntimes 1 is 5 plus 3, and then this is\\nclearly equal to 8. Now let's do it when\\nt is equal to 8.

So 5t is 5 times 10. Instead of a t, put a 10 there. 5 times 10 plus 3. That's a slightly\\ndifferent shade of green, but I think you get the idea. 5 times 10 is 50.

       " '1.3.2': \"- [Voiceover] Let's see\\nif we can give ourselves some practice evaluating expressions that have two different variables in them So let's see if we can\\nevaluate the expression seven J plus five minus eight K, when J is equal to 0.5\\nand K is equal to 0.25. So why don't you try to pause the video and evaluate this first before\\nwe work through it together. Alright, so if we want\\nto evaluate this thing, everywhere we see a J we\\nwant to replace it with a 0.5 and everywhere we see a K we want to replace it with a 0.25, so let's do that. This is going to be seven times, and instead of J I'm gonna put a zero, a 0.5 in there. And then we have plus five minus eight times K. And K we're saying is 0.25. 0.25. So what is this going to be equal to? So if I were to take, if I were to take, and I can color code this, seven times 0.5. Half of 7, that's going to\\nbe three and a half, 3.5. Then I have plus five. And then I'm gonna subtract. I am subtracting eight times 0.25. 0.25, this is 1/4. I could rewrite this if I want. 0.25, that's the same thing as 1/4. Eight times 1/4, or another\\nway to think about it is eight divided by four is\\ngonna be equal to two. So this whole thing over here\\nis going to be equal to two. So it's gonna be minus, we\\nhave this minus out here, so minus two. And what is this going to be? Well, let's think about it. 3.5 plus five is 8.5, minus two is going to be 6.5. So this is equal to this, is equal to 6.5. Let's do another one of these. Alright. And we'll, just like before, try to work through it on your own before we do it together. Alright, now let's do it together. So over here I have this expression 0.1 M plus eight minus 12 N, when M is equal to 30\\nand N is equal to 1/4. Alright. So everywhere I see an M I\\nwant to replace with a 30. And everywhere I see an N I\\nwant to replace with a 1/4. So this is going to be equal to 0.1 times M. M is 30. Times 30 plus eight minus 12 times N, where N is 1/4. N is 1/4. So what is, what is 1/10, This right over here,\\n0.1, that's the same thing as 1/10 of 30? Well 1/10 of 30, that's going to be three. So this part is three. And we have three plus eight. And then we're gonna have minus. Well what is 12 times 1/4? That's gonna be 12/4,\\nor 12 divided by four, which is going to be equal to three. And now when we evaluate this, so that is equal to this, we have three plus eight minus three. Well, threes are going to, you know positive three, then\\nyou're gonna subtract three, and you're just going to be left with, you're just going to\\nbe left with an eight. And you're done.

       " '1.4.1': \"Let's say that I've\\ngot 2 Chuck Norrises, or maybe it's Chuck Norri. And to that I am going to\\nadd another 3 Chuck Norrises. So I'm going to add\\nanother 3 Chuck Norrises. And this might seem\\na little bit obvious, but how many Chuck\\nNorrises do I now have? Well, 2 Chuck Norrises,\\nwe can represent this as literally a Chuck\\nNorris plus a Chuck Norris. So let me do that,\\na Chuck Norris plus another Chuck\\nNorris, 2 Chuck Norrises. You could also do this\\n2 times Chuck Norris, and this is just another\\nway of representing it. And 3 Chuck Norrises-- you\\ncould do that as a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris plus\\nanother Chuck Norris. And so we would\\nhave a grand total-- and this might be\\nvery simple for you. But you would have a\\ngrand total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Chuck Norrises. So this would be equal\\nto 5 Chuck Norrises. Now, let's get a little\\nbit more abstract here. Chuck Norris is a\\nvery tangible thing. So let's go to a\\nlittle bit more of traditional algebraic notation. If I have 2x's and\\nremember, you could do this as 2x's or 2 times x. And to that, I would add\\n3x's How many x's do I have? Well, once again,\\n2x's, that's 2 times x. You could do that\\nas an x plus an x. We don't know what\\nthe value of x is. But whatever that value is,\\nwe can add it to itself. And then 3x's are they're\\ngoing to be that value. Let me do that in\\nthat same green color. 3x's are going to be that\\nvalue plus that value plus whatever that value is. And so how many\\nx's do I now have? Well, I'm going to\\nhave 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 x's. So 2x plus 3x is equal to 5x. And if you think about it, all\\nwe really did-- and hopefully, you conceptually\\nget it-- is we just added the 2 numbers that\\nwere multiplying the x. And these numbers, the 2 or the\\n3, they're called coefficients. Very fancy word, but it's\\njust this constant number, this regular number that's\\nmultiplied by the variable. You just added the 2 and\\nthe 3, to get your 5x. Now, let's think about\\nthis a little bit more. Let's go back to this original\\nexpression, the 2 Chuck Norrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises. Let's say, to that,\\nwe were to add to some type of a-- let's we\\nwere to add 7 plums over here. So this is my drawing of a plum. So we have 7 plums plus 2 Chuck\\nNorrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises. And let's say that I\\nadd another 2 plums. I add another 2 plums here. So what this whole thing be? Well, I wouldn't add the 7\\nto the 2 to the 3 plus the 2. We're adding\\ndifferent things here. You have 2 Chuck Norrises\\nand 3 Chuck Norrises, so they're still going to\\nsimplify to 5 Chuck Norrises. . And then we would separately\\nthink about the plums. We have 7 plums, and we're\\nadding another 2 plums. We're going to have 9 plums. Plus 9 plums, so this simplifies\\nto five Chuck Norrises and 9 plums. Similarly, over here,\\ninstead of just 2x plus 3x, if I had 7y plus 2x plus 3x\\nplus 2y, what do I now have? Well, I can't add the\\nx's and the y's. They could very well\\nrepresent a different number. So all I can do is\\nreally add the x's. And then I get the 5x. And then, I'd\\nseparately add the y. If I have 7y's and to that I add\\n2y's, I'm going to have 9y's. If I have 7 of something\\nand I add 2 of something, I now have 9 of that something. So I'm going to have 9y's. So you add that. Do that in a different color. You add this and this. You get that. You add the x's. You get that right over there. So hopefully, that\\nmakes a little sense. Actually I'll throw\\nout one more idea. So given this, what would happen\\nif I were to have 2x plus 1 plus 7x plus 5? Well, once again,\\nyou might be tempted to add the 2 plus\\nthe 1, but they're adding different things. These are 2x's. This is just the number 1. So you really just have\\nto add the x's together. So you're going to\\nsay, well, I got 2x's. And I'm going to\\nadd 7x's to that. Well, that means\\nI now have 9x's. And then, separately,\\nyou'd say, well, I've got just the\\nabstract number 1. And then I've got another 5. 1 plus 5 is going\\nto be equal to 6. \",\n",
       " '1.4.2': \"I've gotten feedback\\nthat all the Chuck Norris imagery in the last video might\\nhave been a little bit too overwhelming. So for this video, I've included\\nsomething a little bit more soothing. Let's try to simplify\\nsome more expressions. And we'll see we're\\njust applying ideas that we already knew about. Let's say I want to simplify the\\nexpression 2 times 3x plus 5. Well, this literally\\nmeans two 3x plus 5's. So this is the exact same thing. This is one 3x plus\\n5, and then to that, I'm going to add\\nanother 3x plus 5. This is literally what\\n2 times 3x plus 5 means. Well, this is the same thing\\nas, if we just look at it right over here, we have now two 3x's. So we could write\\nit as 2 times 3x. Plus, we have two 5's,\\nso plus 2 times 5. You might say, hey, Sal, isn't\\nthis just the distributive property that I know\\nfrom arithmetic? I've essentially just\\ndistributed the 2? 2 times 3x plus 2 times 5? And I would tell\\nyou, yes, it is. And the whole reason why I'm\\ndoing this is just to show you that it is exactly\\nwhat you already know. But with that out of the way,\\nlet's continue to simplify it. When you multiply the 2\\ntimes the 3x, you get 6x. When you multiply the 2\\ntimes the 5, you get 10. So this simplified\\nto 6x plus 10. Now let's try something that's\\na little bit more involved. Once again, really just\\nthings that you already know. Let's say I had 7 times 3y minus\\n5 minus 2 times 10 plus 4y. Let's see if we\\ncan simplify this. Well, let's work on\\nthe left-hand side of the expression, the\\n7 times 3y minus 5. We just have to\\ndistribute the 7. This is going to be 7 times 3y,\\nwhich is going to give us 21y. Or if I had 3 y's\\n7 times, that's going to be 21 y's, either way\\nyou want to think about it. And then I have 7\\ntimes-- we've got to be careful with\\nthe sign-- negative 5. 7 times negative\\n5 is negative 35. So we've simplified\\nthis part of it. Let's simplify the\\nright-hand side. You might be tempted to say,\\noh, 2 times 10 and 2 times 4y and then subtract them. And if you do that right and\\nyou distribute the subtraction, it would work out. But I like think of\\nthis as negative 2, and we're going to\\ndistribute the negative 2 times 10 and the\\nnegative 2 times 4y. So negative 2 times\\n10 is negative 20, so it's minus 20\\nright over here. And then negative 2 times\\n4, negative 2 times 4 is negative 8, so it's\\ngoing to be negative 8y. Let's write a minus\\n8y right over here. And are we done simplifying? Well, no, there's a little\\nbit more that we can do. We can't add the 21y to the\\nnegative 35 or the negative 20 because these are\\nadding different things or subtracting different things. But we do have two things\\nthat are multiplying y. Let me do all in\\nthis green color. You have 21 y's right over here. And then we can view it as from\\nthat we are subtracting 8 y's. So if I have 21 of something\\nand I take 8 of them away, I'm left with 13\\nof that something. So those are going to\\nsimplify to 13 y's. I'll do this in a new color. And then I have\\nnegative 35 minus 20. That's just going to\\nsimplify to negative 55. So this whole thing\\nsimplified, using a little bit of the distributive\\nproperty and combining similar or like terms,\\nwe got to 13y minus 55. \",\n",
       " '1.4.3': \"Now we have a very, very,\\nvery hairy expression. And once again, I'm going to\\nsee if you can simplify this. And I'll give you\\nlittle time to do it. So this one is even crazier than\\nthe last few we've looked at. We've got y's and\\nxy's, and x squared and x's, well more just xy's and\\ny squared and on and on and on. And there will be a temptation,\\nbecause you see a y here and a y here to\\nsay, oh, maybe I can add this negative\\n3y plus this 4xy somehow since I see a y and a y. But the important\\nthing to realize here is that a y is\\ndifferent than an xy. Think about it\\nthey were numbers. If y was 3 and an x was a\\n2, then a y would be a 3 while an xy would have been a 6. And a y is very different\\nthan a y squared. Once again, if the why it\\ntook on the value 3, then the y squared would\\nbe the value 9. So even though you see\\nthe same letter here, they aren't the same-- I\\nguess you cannot add these two or subtract these two terms. A y is different\\nthan a y squared, is different than an xy. Now with that said, let's\\nsee if there is anything that we can simplify. So first, let's think\\nabout the y terms. So you have a negative 3y there. Do we have any more y term? Yes, we do. We have this 2y\\nright over there. So I'll just write it\\nout-- I'll just reorder it. So we have negative 3y plus 2y. Now, let's think\\nabout-- and I'm just going in an arbitrary order,\\nbut since our next term is an xy term-- let's think about\\nall of the xy terms. So we have plus 4xy\\nright over here. So let me just write\\nit down-- I'm just reordering the whole\\nexpression-- plus 4xy. And then I have minus\\n4xy right over here. Then let's go to\\nthe x squared terms. I have negative 2 times x\\nsquared, or minus 2x squared. So let's look at this. So I have minus 2x squared. Do I have any other x squared? Yes, I do. I have this 3x squared\\nright over there. So plus 3x squared. And then let's see, I have\\nan x term right over here, and that actually looks\\nlike the only x term. So that's plus 2x. And then I only\\nhave one y squared term-- I'll circle that in\\norange-- so plus y squared. So all I have done is I've\\nreordered the statement and I've color coded it based\\non the type of term we have. And now it should be\\na little bit simpler. So let's try it out. If I have negative\\n3 of something plus 2 of that something,\\nwhat do I have? Or another way to say it,\\nif I have two of something and I subtract 3 of that,\\nwhat am I left with? Well, I'm left with negative\\n1 of that something. So I could write negative 1y, or\\nI could just write negative y. And another way you\\ncould think about it, but I like to think about\\nit intuitively more, is what's the coefficient here? It is negative 3. What's the coefficient here? It's 2. Where obviously\\nboth are dealing-- they're both y\\nterms, not xy terms, not y squared terms, just y. And so negative 3\\nplus 2 is negative 1, or negative 1y is the\\nsame thing as negative y. So those simplify to\\nthis right over here. Now let's look at the xy terms. If I have 4 of\\nthis, 4 xy's and I were to take away 4 xy's,\\nhow many xy's am I left with? Well, I'm left with no xy's. Or you could say add\\nthe coefficients, 4 plus negative 4,\\ngives you 0 xy's. Either way, these\\ntwo cancel out. If I have 4 of something\\nand I take away those 4 of that something,\\nI'm left with none of them. And so I'm left with no xy's. And then I have\\nright over here-- I could have written\\n0xy, but that seems unnecessary--\\nthen right over here I have my x squared terms. Negative 2 plus 3 is 1. Or another way of saying\\nit, if I have 3x squared and I were to take\\naway 2 of those x squared, so I'm left\\nwith the 1x squared. So this right over here\\nsimplifies to 1x squared. Or I could literally\\njust write x squared. 1x squared is the same\\nthing as x squared. So plus x squared,\\nand then these there's nothing really left to simplify. So plus 2x plus y squared. And we're done. And obviously you\\nmight have gotten an answer in some other\\norder, but the order in which I write these\\nterms don't matter. It just matters that you\\nwere able to simplify it to these four terms. \",\n",
       " '1.4.4': \"- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this video is get some practice simplifying expressions and have some hairier numbers involved. These numbers are kind of hairy. Like always, try to pause this video and see if you can simplify this expression before I take a stab at it. All right, I'm assuming you have attempted it. Now let's look at it. We have -5.55 minus 8.55c plus 4.35c. So the first thing I wanna do is can I combine these c terms, and I definitely can. We can add -8.55c to 4.35c first, and then that would be, let's see, that would be -8.55 plus 4.35, I'm just adding the coefficients, times c, and of course, we still have that -5.55 out front. -5.55. I'll just put a plus there. Now how do we calculate -8.55 plus 4.35? Well there's a couple of ways to think about it or visualize it. One way is to say well this is the same thing as the negative of 8.55 minus 4.35, and 8.55 minus 4.35, let's see, eight minus four is going to be the negative, eight minus four is four, 55 hundredths minus 35 hundredths is 20 hundredths. So I could write 4.20, which is really just the same thing as 4.2. So all of this can be replaced with a -4.2. So my entire expression has simplified to -5.55, and instead of saying plus -4.2c, I can just write it as minus 4.2c, and we're done. We can't simplify this anymore. We can't add this term that doesn't involve the variable to this term that does involve the variable. So this is about as simple as we're gonna get. So let's do another example. So here I have some more hairy numbers involved. These are all expressed as fractions. And so, let's see, I have 2/5m minus 4/5 minus 3/5m. So how can I simplify? Well I could add all the m terms together. So let me just change the order. I could rewrite this as 2/5m minus 3/5m minus 4/5. All I did was I changed the order. We can see that I have these two m terms. I can add those two together. So this is going to be 2/5 minus 3/5 times m, and then I have the -4/5 still on the right hand side. Now what's 2/5 minus 3/5? Well that's gonna be -1/5. That's gonna be -1/5. So I have -1/5m minus 4/5. Minus 4/5. Now once again, I'm done. I can't simplify it anymore. I can't add this term that involves m somehow to this -4/5. So we are done here. Let's do one more. Let's do one more example. So here, and this is interesting, I have a parentheses and all the rest. Like always, pause the video. See if you can simplify this. All right, let's work through it together. Now the first thing that I want to do is let's distribute this two so that we just have three terms that are just being added and subtracted. So if we distribute this two, we're gonna get two times 1/5m is 2/5m. Let me make sure you see that m. M is right here. Two times -2/5 is -4/5, and then I have plus 3/5. Now how can we simplify this more? Well I have these two terms here that don't involve the variable. Those are just numbers. I can add them to each other. So I have -4/5 plus 3/5. So what's negative four plus three? That's going to be negative one. So this is going to be -1/5, what we have in yellow here. I still have the 2/5m, 2/5m minus 1/5. And we're done. We've simplified that as much as we can. \",\n",
       " '1.5.1': '- Which expressions are equivalent to x plus two-y plus x plus two? Select all that apply. Alright. Let\\'s see if I can manipulate\\nthis thing a little bit. Let me just rewrite it so I have x plus... x plus two-y plus x plus two. So, the first thing that jumps out at me, before I even look at these choices, here I have an x over here,\\nI have an x over there. Well, if I have one x, and\\nthen I can add it to another x that would be two-x so\\nI could rewrite this... let me do this in a different color. I could rewrite this x and this x, if I add them together\\nthat\\'s going to be two-x. So, this is...actually, I\\ndon\\'t want to skip any steps. So, that\\'s x plus x plus two-y... now I\\'m just switching\\nthe order...plus two. And then these two x\\'s right over here, I can just rewrite that as two-x. So, I have two-x plus two-y... plus two-y plus two. Now, let\\'s see, out of all my choices... so, this one, this is two-x plus four-y plus four. So, that\\'s not right, I have\\ntwo-x plus two-y plus 2, so I can rule this one out. Now, this one\\'s interesting, it looks like they have factored out a two. Let\\'s see if we factor out\\na two here, what happens? So, we do see that two\\nis a factor of that term, it\\'s a factor of that term,\\nand it\\'s a factor of that term. So, let\\'s see if we can factor it out. So, this is going to be two times x, I\\'ll do the x in that same\\nmagenta color, two times x plus, we have just a y left when\\nyou factor out the two. And then if you factor out a two here, you\\'re just going to have a one left. So, two times x plus y plus one. Which is exactly what they have over here. And since I was able to find a choice, I will not pick \"None of the above\". ',\n",
       " '1.6.1': 'Comedian Steven\\nWright-- and I guess we can credit him with being\\na bit of a philosopher-- once commented that \"Black holes\\nare where God divided by zero.\" And I won\\'t get in\\nto the physics of it, and obviously the metaphor\\nbreaks down in certain ways But it is strangely appropriate,\\nbecause black holes are where our current understanding of\\nphysics seems to break down and dividing by zero, as simple\\nof idea as that seems to be, is where our mathematics\\nalso breaks down. This is \"undefined.\" Sometimes when you see\\n\"undefined\" in math class it seems like a\\nvery strange thing. It seems like a\\nvery bizarre idea. But it really means exactly\\nwhat the word means. Mathematicians\\nhave never defined what it must mean\\nto divide by zero. What is that value? And the reason they\\nhaven\\'t done it is because they couldn\\'t\\ncome up with a good answer. There\\'s no good answer\\nhere, no good definition. And because of that,\\nany non-zero number, divided by zero, is\\nleft just \"undefined.\" 7 divided by 0. 8 divided by 0. Negative 1 divided by 0. We say all of these things\\nare just \"undefined.\" You might say, well if\\nwe can just define it, let\\'s at least try to come\\nup with a definition of what it means to take a non-zero\\nnumber divided by zero. So let\\'s do that right now. We could just take the simplest\\nof all non-zero numbers. We\\'ll just do it with one. But we could have done this\\nwith any non-zero number. Let\\'s take the example of one. Since we don\\'t know\\nwhat it means-- or we\\'re trying to figure out what it\\nmeans to divide by zero Lets just try out really, really,\\nsmall positive numbers. Let\\'s divide by really,\\nreally small positive numbers and see what happens as\\nwe get close to zero. So lets divide by 0.1 Well,\\nthis will get us to 10. If we divide 1 by 0.01\\nthat gets us to 100. If I go really,\\nreally close to zero. If I divide 1 by\\n0.000001 this gets us-- so this is not a tenth,\\nhundredth, thousandth, ten thousandth,\\nhundred thousandth. This is a millionth. 1 divided by a millionth, that\\'s\\ngoing to give us 1 million. So we see a pattern here. As we divide one by smaller\\nand smaller and smaller positive numbers, we get a\\nlarger and larger and larger value. Based on just this you\\nmight say, well, hey, I\\'ve got somewhat of a\\ndefinition for 1 divided by 0. Maybe we can say that 1 divided\\nby 0 is positive infinity. As we get smaller and smaller\\npositive numbers here, we get super super large\\nnumbers right over here. But then, your friend\\nmight say, well, that worked when we divided by\\npositive numbers close to zero but what happens when we\\ndivide by negative numbers close to zero? So lets try those out. Well, 1 divided by negative 0.1,\\nthat\\'s going to be negative 10. 1 divided by\\nnegative 0.01, that\\'s going to be negative 100. And, if we go all the way to 1\\ndivided by negative 0.000001-- yup, I drew the same\\nnumber of zeros-- that gets us to\\nnegative 1 million. So you when we keep dividing\\n1 by negative numbers that are closer and closer and\\ncloser and closer to zero, we get a very different answer. We actually start approaching\\nnegative infinity. So over here we said maybe it\\nwould be positive infinity, but you can make an\\nequally strong argument that it could be a\\nvery different number. Negative infinity is going\\nthe exact opposite direction. So you could make an\\nequally strong argument that it should be\\nnegative infinity. And this is why\\nmathematicians say there\\'s just no\\ngood answer here. Especially one that\\'s consistent\\nwith the rest of mathematics. They could have just said\\nit\\'s equal to 42 or something like that. But that would make no sense. It\\'s neither one\\nof these values, and it wouldn\\'t be consistent\\nwith everything else we know. So they just left the\\nwhole thing \"undefined.\" ',\n",
       " '1.6.2': 'In the last video we saw why when we take any non-zero number divided by zero why mathematicians have left that as being undefined. But it might have raised a question in your brain. What about zero divided by zero? Isn\\'t there an argument why that could be defined? So we\\'re gonna think about zero divided by zero. Well there\\'s a couple of lines of reasoning here. One, you could start taking numbers closer and closer to zero and dividing them by themselves. So for example, you take 0.1 divided by 0.1. Well that\\'s gonna be one. Let\\'s get even closer to zero: 0.001 divided by 0.001. Well, that also equals one. Let\\'s get super close to zero: 0.000001 divided by 0.000001. Well once again, that also equals one. And it didn\\'t even matter whether these were positive or negative. I could make these negative and I\\'d still get the same result. Negative this thing divided by negative this thing still gets me to one. So based on this logic you might say, \"Hey, well this seems like a pretty reasonable argument for zero divided by zero to be defined as being equal to one. \" But someone could come along and say, \"Well what happens if we divide zero by numbers closer and closer to zero; not a number by itself, but zero by smaller and smaller numbers, or numbers closer and closer to zero.\" And so they say, \"For example, zero divided by 0.1, well that\\'s just going to be zero. Zero divided by 0.001, well that\\'s also going to be to zero. 0 divided by 0.000001 is also going to be equal to zero.\" And it didn\\'t matter whether we were dividing by a positive or negative number. Make all of these negatives, you still get the same answer. So this line of reasoning tells you that it\\'s completely legitimate, to think at least that maybe zero divided by zero could be equal to zero. And these are equally valid arguments.

       " '2.1.1': \"Alright, now we have a very interesting situation. On both sides of the scale, we have our mystery mass and now I'm calling the mystery mass having a mass of Y. Just to show you that it doesn't always have to be X. It can be any symbol as long as you can keep track of that symbol. But all these have the same mass. That's why I wrote Y on all of them. And we also have a little 1 kilogram boxes on both sides of the scale. So the first thing I wanna do, we're gonna do step by step and try to figure out what this mystery mass is. But the first thing I wanna do is, is, is, have you think about, whether you can represent this algebraically? Whether with, with a little bit of mathematic symbolry, you can represent what's going on this scale. Over here, I have three Ys and three of these boxes and their total mass is equal to this one Y. And I think I have about let's see, I have 7 boxes right over here. So I'll give you a few seconds to do that. So let's think about the total mass over here. We have 3 boxes and a mass Y. So they're going to have a mass of 3Y, and then you have 3 boxes with a mass of 1 kilogram. So they're going to have a mass of 3 kilograms. Now over here, I have 1 box with a mass of Y kilograms. So that's going to be my 1Y right over there. I could've written 1Y but that's, I don't need to. A Y is the same thing as 1Y. So I have the Y kilograms right there. And I have seven of these, right? 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Yup, seven of these. So I have Y plus 7 kilograms on the right-hand side. And once again, it's balanced. The scale is balanced. This mass, total mass is equal to this total mass. So we can write an equal sign, right over there. So that's a good starting point. We were able to represent this situation to this real-life simple situation. You know, back in the day, when people actually had to figure out the mass of things if you were to go the jewelry store, whatever. They actually did had problems like this. We were able to represent it mathematically. Now the next thing to do is, what are some reasonable next steps? How can we start to simplify this a little bit? You know, once again, I'll give you a few seconds to think about that. Well, the neat thing about algebra is there's actually multiple paths that you could go down. You might say, well why won't we remove 3 of these what, of these yellow blocks from both sides? That would be completely legitimate. You might say, well, why won't we remove 1 of these Ys from both sides? That also would be legitimate. And we could do it in either order. So let's just pick one of them. Let's say that we've first want to remove, let's say that we first want to remove the, a Y from either sides. Just so that we feel a little bit more comfortable with all of our Ys sitting on the 1 side. And so the best way, if we don't want all of our Ys to sit on the 1 side, we can remove, we can remove a Y from each side. Remember, if you removed a Y from only 1 side, that would unbalance the scale. The scale was already balanced whatever you have to do to the one side after you do the other. So I'm gonna remove a Y, I'm gonna remove Y mass from both sides. Now what will that look like algebraically? Well. I remove the Y from both sides. So I subtracted Y from the left-hand side and I subtracted Y from the right-hand side. That's exactly what I did. The mass, it had a massive Y. I don't know what that is but I did take it away. I lifted that block, that little, that little block. And so, on the left-hand side, on the left-hand side, what am I left with? That you can pick it up mathematically, you can even look up here, and look up here what you're left with. If I had 3 of something, and I take away 1 of them, if I take away 1 of them, I'm left with 2 of that something. So I'm left with 2Y, right over here, you see it. I had 3, I got rid of 1, so I'm left with 2. And I still have those 3 yellow blocks. So I still have those 3 yellow blocks. On the right-hand side, I had a Y, I took away the Y, and so now I have no Ys left. We see it visually right over here. And I still have 7 of the yellow blocks. So I still have 7 of the yellow blocks. And since I took the exact same mass from both sides of the scale, the scale is still going to be balanced. It was balanced before, I took away the same thing from both sides. And so the scale is still, is still balanced. So this is going to be equal to that. Now, now just trying to look a bit similar to what we saw in that last video. But I will ask you, what can we do from this point? What can we do from this point to simplify it further or so, even better, think of it so we could isolate the, these Ys on the left-hand side. And I'll give you a few seconds to think about that. Well, if we want to isolate these Ys on the left-hand side, these 2 Ys, the best way is to get rid of this 3, to get rid of these 3 blocks. So why won't we do that? Let's take 3 blocks from this side but we can't just take it from that side if we want to keep it balanced. We have to do it to this side too. We gotta take away, we gotta take away 3 blocks. So we're subtracting 3 from that side, and subtracting 3 from the right side. So on the left-hand side, on the left-hand side, we're gonna be left with just these 2 blocks of mass Y. So our total mass is now going to be 2Y. These 3 minus 3 is 0, and you see that here. We're just left with 2Ys right over here, and on the right-hand side, we got rid of 3 of the blocks. So we only have 4 of them left. So you have 4 of them left. So you have 2 of these Y masses is equal to 4 kilograms. And because we did the same thing to both sides, the scale is still balanced. And now, well how do we solve this? And you might be able to solve this in your head. I have 2 times something is equal to 4. And you can kind of think about what that is, but if we want to stay true to what we've been doing before, let's think about it. I have 2 of something, is equal to something else. What if I multiply both sides by 2? Oh, sorry, what if I multiply both sides by 1/2 or another way is dividing both sides by 2. If I multiply this side by 1/2, if I essentially take away half of the mass, or I'll only leave half of the mass, Then, I'm only gonna have 1 block here, and if I take away half of the mass over here, I'm gonna have to take away 2 of these blocks right over there. And what I just did, you could say I multiplied both sides by 1/2 or just for a sake of a little change, You could say I divided both sides by 2. And on the left-hand side, I'm left with a mass of Y. And on the right-hand side, I'm left with a mass of 4 divided by 2 is 2. And once again I can still write this equal sign because the scale is balanced. I did the exact same thing to both sides. I left half to what was on the left-hand side, and half of it was on the right-hand side. It was balanced before, half of each side, so it's going to be balanced again. But there, we've done it. We've solved something that's actually not so easy to solve. Or it might not look so easy first. We figured out that our mystery mass Y is 2 kilograms. And you can verify this, this is the really fun thing about algebra. Is it, once you get to this point, you can go back and think about whether the original, the original problem you saw made sense. Let's do that. Let's think about whether the original problem made sense. And to do that, I want you to, I want you to calculate. Now that we know what the mass Y is it's 2 kilograms. What was the total mass on each side? Well, let's calculate it. We have 2 right, right over here, this is 2 kilograms, I'll do that in purple color,so this is a 2, this is a 2, this is a 2. So we had 6 kilograms plus these 3, we had 9 kilograms on the left-hand side. And on the right-hand side, I had these 7 plus 2 here, 7 plus 2 is 9 kilograms. That's why it was balanced. Our mystery mass, we had 9 kilograms, total on both sides. \",\n",
       " '2.1.2': \"Let's try to solve a\\nmore involved equation. So, let's say that we have 2x\\nplus 3, 2x plus 3 is equal to is equal to 5x minus 2. So this might look a\\nlittle daunting at first. We have x's on both\\nsides of the equation. We're adding and\\nsubtracting numbers. How do you solve it? And we'll do it in a\\ncouple of different ways. The the important thing\\nto remember is, we just want to isolate an x. Once you've isolated an x,\\nyou have x equals something. Or x equals something. You're done, you've\\nsolved the equation. You can actually go back and\\ncheck whether that works, So what we're going to do is just\\ndo a bunch of operations on both sides of the equation,\\nto eventually isolate the x. But while we do those, I\\nactually want to visualize what's occurring. Because I don't want you just\\nsay, oh what are the rules or the steps of solving equations. And I forgot whether this is a\\nallowed or that isn't allowed. If you visualize what's\\nhappening, it'll actually be common sense what's allowed. So let's visualize it. So we have 2x right here\\non the left-hand side. So that's literally,\\nthat's x plus x. And then you have plus 3. Plus 3, I'll do it like this. So that's equal to plus\\n1, plus 1, plus 1. That's the same thing as 3. I could've drawn 3\\ncircles here as well. Let do the same color. Plus 3. And then that is\\nequal to 5 x's. Do that in blue. That is equal to 5 x's. So, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. And I want to make it clear. You would never actually\\nhave to do it this way when you're solving the problem. You would just have to\\ndo the algebraic steps. But I'm doing this for you so\\nyou can actually visualize what this equation is saying. the left-hand side is these\\ntwo orange x's plus 3. The right-hand side\\nis 5x minus 2. So minus 2, we could write\\nas -- so let me do this in a different color,\\nI'll do it in pink. So, minus 2, I'll do as\\nminus 1 and minus 1. Now, we want to isolate\\nthe x's on the same side of the equation. So, how could we do that? Well, there's two\\nways of doing it. We could subtract these\\ntwo x's from both sides of the equation. And that would be\\npretty reasonable. Because then you'd have\\n5 x's minus the 2 x's. You'd have a positive number of\\nx's on the right-hand side. Or, you could actually\\nsubtract 5x from both sides. And that's what's\\nneat about algebra. As long as you do legitimate\\noperations, you will eventually get the right answer. So let's just start off\\nsubtracting 2x from both sides of the equation. And what I mean there, I mean\\nwe're going to remove 2 x's from the left-hand side. And if we were to move 2 x's on\\nthe left-hand side, we have to remove 2 x's the\\nright-hand side. Just like that. So what does that give us? We're subtracting 2 x's. 2 x's from the left. And we're also going to\\nsubtract 2 x's from the right. Now, what does our left-hand\\nside simplify to? We have 2x plus 3 minus 2x. The 2 x's cancel out. So you're just left with --\\nyou're just left with the 3. And you see that over here. We took 2 of these x's away. We're just left with the\\nplus 1, plus 1, plus 1. And then on the right-hand\\nside, 5x minus 2x. We have it over here. We have 5 x's minus 2 x's. You only have 1, 2,\\n3, x's left over. 3 is equal to 3x. And then you have\\nyour minus 2 there. You have your minus 2. So, normally if you were to do\\nthe problem, you would just have to write what we have\\nhere on the left-hand side. So what can we do next? Remember, we want to\\nisolate the x's. Well, we have all of our x's on\\nthe right-hand side right here. If we could get rid of this\\nnegative 2, off of the right-hand side, then\\nthe x's will be alone. They'll be isolated. So how can we get rid of\\nthis negative 2, if we visualize it over here. This negative 1,\\nthis negative 1. Well, we could add 2 to both\\nsides of this equation. Think about what happens there. So, if we add 2, so I'm\\ngoing to do it like this. Plus 1, plus 1. So you could literally see. We're adding 2. And then we're going to add\\n2 to the left-hand side. 1 plus, 1 plus. What happens? Let me do it over here as well. So we're going to add 2. We're going to add 2. So what happens to\\nthe left-hand side? 3 plus 2 is going\\nto be equal to 5. And that is going to be\\nequal to 3x minus 2 plus 2. These guys cancel out. And you're just left with 3x. And we see it over here. We have the left-hand side is 1\\nplus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. We have 5 1's, or 5. And the right-hand side,\\nwe have the 3 x's, right over there. And then we have the\\nnegative 1, negative 1. Plus 1, plus 1, negative\\n1, these cancel out. They get us to 0. They cancel out. So we're just left with\\n5 is equal to 3x. So we have 1, 2, 3,\\n4, 5 is equal to 3x. Let me clear everything that\\nwe've removed, so it looks a little bit cleaner. These are all of the things\\nthat we've removed. Let me clear that out. And then let me clear\\nthat out, like that. Edit. Clear. So now we are just left\\nwith 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Actually, let me\\nmove this over. So I could just move this\\nover right over here. We now have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. These are the two that we\\nadded here, is equal to 3x. These guys canceled out. That's why we have\\nnothing there. Now, to solve this, we\\njust divide both sides of this equation by 3. And this is going to\\nbe a little hard to visualize over here. But if we divide over here both\\nsides by 3, what do we get? We divide the left by 3. We divide the right by 3. The whole reason why we divided\\nby 3 is because the x was being multiplied by 3. 3 is the coefficient on the x. Fancy word, it literally\\njust means the number multiplying the variable. The number we're solving, the\\nvariable we're solving for. So these 3's cancel out. The right-hand side of\\nthe equation is just x. The left-hand side is 5/3. So 5/3, we could say\\nis is equal to 5/3. And this is different than\\neverything we've seen so far. I now have the x on the\\nright-hand side, the value on the left-hand side. That's completely fine. This is the exact same thing as\\nsaying 5/3 is is equal to x is the same thing as saying\\nx's equal to 5/3. Completely equivalent. Completely equivalent. We sometimes get more used\\nto this one, but this is completely the same thing. Now, if we wanted to write this\\nas a mixed number, if we want to write this as a mixed\\nnumber, 3 goes into 5 one time with remainder 2. So it's going to be 1 2/3. So it's going to be 1 2/3. So we could also write\\nthat x is equal to 1 2/3. And I'll leave it up for you\\nto actually substitute back into this original equation. And see that it works out. Now, to visualize it over here,\\nyou know, how did he get 1 2/3, let's think about it. Instead of doing 1, I'm\\ngoing to do circles. I am going to do circles. Actually, even better,\\nI'm going to do squares. So I'm going to have 5 squares\\non the left-hand side. I'll do it in this same\\nyellow color right here. So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And that is going to be\\nequal to the 3 x's. x plus x plus x. Now, we're dividing both\\nsides of the equation by 3. We're dividing both sides\\nof the equation by 3. Actually, that's where\\nwe did it up here, we divided both sides by 3. So how do you do that\\nright-hand side's pretty straightforward. You want to divide these\\n3 x's into 3 groups. That's 1, 2, 3 groups. 1, 2, 3. Now, how do you\\ndivide 5 into 3? And they have to be thought\\nthrough even groups. And the answer tells us. Each group is going\\nto be 1 2/3. So, 1 2/3. So it's going to be 2/3\\nof this, the next one. And then we're going\\nto have 1 2/3. So this is 1/3. We're going to need another. Another 1, so this is 1 1/3. We're going to need 1 more\\n1/3, so this is going to be right here. And then we're left\\nwith 2/3 and 1. So we've broken it\\nup into 3 groups. This right here. Let me make it clear. Let me make it clear, this\\nright here is 1 2/3. 1 2/3. And then this right\\nhere, this 1/3. That's another 1/3, so\\nthat's 2/3, and then that's 1 right there. So that's 1 2/3. And then finally this\\nis 2/3 and this is 1, so this is 1 2/3. So when you divide both\\nsides by 3 you get 1 2/3. Each section, each bucket, is\\n1 2/3 on the left-hand side. On the left-hand side, or 5/3. And on the right-hand\\nside we just have an x. So it still works. A little bit harder to\\nvisualize with fractions. \",\n",
       " '2.1.3': \"We have the equation 20 minus\\n7 times x is equal to 6 times x minus 6. And we need to solve for x. So the way I like to do these\\nis we just like to separate the constant terms, which are\\nthe 20 and the negative 6 on one side of the equation. I'll put them on the\\nright-hand side. And then we'll put all the x\\nterms, the negative 7x and the 6x, we'll put it all on\\nthe left-hand side. So to get the 20 out of the way\\nfrom the left-hand side, let's subtract it. Let's subtract it from\\nthe left-hand side. But this is an equation,\\nanything you do to the left-hand side, you also have to\\ndo to the right-hand side. If that is equal to that, in\\norder for them to still be equal, anything I do to the\\nleft-hand side I have to do to the right-hand side. So I subtracted 20 from the\\nleft, let me also subtract 20 from the right. And so the left-hand side\\nof the equation, 20 minus 20 is just 0. That was the whole point,\\nthey cancel out. Don't have to write it down. And then I have a negative 7x,\\nit just gets carried down. And then that is equal to the right-hand side of the equation. I have a 6x. I'm not adding or subtracting\\nanything to that. But then I have a negative\\n6 minus 20. So if I'm already 6 below 0 on\\nthe number line, and I go another 20 below that, that's\\nat negative 26. Now, the next thing we want to\\ndo is we want to get all the x terms on the left-hand side. So we don't want this 6x here,\\nso maybe we subtract 6x from both sides. So let's subtract 6x from the\\nright, subtract 6x from the left, and what do we get? The left-hand side, negative\\n7x minus 6x, that's negative 13x. Right? Negative 7 of something minus\\nanother 6 of that something is going to be negative 13\\nof that something. And that is going to be\\nequal to 6x minus 6x. That cancels out. That was the whole point by\\nsubtracting negative 6x. And then we have just a negative\\n26, or minus 26, depending on how you want to\\nview it, so negative 13x is equal to negative 26. Now, our whole goal, just to\\nremember, is to isolate the x. We have a negative 13\\ntimes the x here. So the best way to isolate it is\\nif we have something times x, if we divide by\\nthat something, we'll isolate the x. So let's divide by\\nnegative 13. Now, you know by now, anything\\nyou do to the left-hand side of an equation, you have to\\ndo to the right-hand side. So we're going to have to\\ndivide both sides of the equation by negative 13. Now, what does the left-hand\\nside become? Negative 13 times x divided\\nby negative 13, that's just going to be x. You multiply something times x,\\ndivide it by the something, you're just going to\\nbe left with an x. So the left-hand side\\njust becomes an x. x is equal to negative 26\\ndivided by negative 13. Well, that's just positive\\n2, right? A negative divided by a negative\\nis a positive. 26 divided by 13 is 2. And that is our answer. That is our answer. Now let's verify that\\nit really works. That's the fun thing\\nabout algebra. You can always make sure that\\nyou got the right answer. So let's substitute it back into\\nthe original equation. So we have 20 minus 7 times x--\\nx is 2-- minus 7 times 2 is equal to 6 times x--\\nwe've solved for x, it is 2-- minus 6. So let's verify that this\\nleft-hand side really does equal this right-hand side. So the left-hand side simplifies\\nto 20 minus 7 times 2, which is 14. 20 minus 14 is 6. That's what the left-hand\\nside simplifies to. The right-hand side, we have 6\\ntimes 2, which is 12 minus 6. 12 minus 6 is 6. So they are, indeed, equal, and\\nwe did, indeed, get the right answer. \",\n",
       " '2.1.4': \"We have the equation 3/4x plus\\n2 is equal to 3/8x minus 4. Now, we could just, right from\\nthe get go, solve this the way we solved everything else, group\\nthe x terms, maybe on the left-hand side, group the\\nconstant terms on the right-hand side. But adding and subtracting\\nfractions are messy. So what I'm going to do, right\\nfrom the start of this video, is to multiply both sides of\\nthis equation by some number so I can get rid of\\nthe fractions. And the best number to do it\\nby-- what number is the smallest number that if I\\nmultiply both of these fractions by it, they won't be\\nfractions anymore, they'll be whole numbers? That smallest number\\nis going to be 8. I'm going to multiply 8 times\\nboth sides of this equation. You say, hey, Sal, how\\ndid you get 8? And I got 8 because I said,\\nwell, what's the least common multiple of 4 and 8? Well, the smallest number that\\nis divisible by 4 and 8 is 8. So when you multiply\\nby 8, it's going to get rid of the fractions. And so let's see what happens. So 8 times 3/4, that's\\nthe same thing as 8 times 3 over 4. Let me do it on the\\nside over here. That's the same thing as 8 times\\n3 over 4, which is equal to 8 divided by 4 is just 2. So it's 2 times 3, which is 6. So the left-hand side becomes\\n8 times 3/4x is 6x. And then 8 times 2 is 16. You have to remember, when you\\nmultiply both sides, or a side, of an equation by a\\nnumber, you multiply every term by that number. So you have to distribute\\nthe 8. So the left-hand side is 6x plus\\n16 is going to be equal to-- 8 times 3/8, that's pretty\\neasy, the 8's cancel out and you're just\\nleft with 3x. And then 8 times negative\\n4 is negative 32. And now we've cleaned up the\\nequation a good bit. Now the next thing, let's try to\\nget all the x terms on the left-hand side, and all the\\nconstant terms on the right. So let's get rid of this\\n3x from the right. Let's subtract 3x from\\nboth sides to do it. That's the best way I can think\\nof of getting rid of the 3x from the right. The left-hand side of this\\nequation, 6x minus 3x is 3x. 6 minus 3 is 3. And then you have a plus 16 is\\nequal to-- 3x minus 3x, that's the whole point of subtracting\\n3x, is so they cancel out. So those guys cancel out, and\\nwe're just left with a negative 32. Now, let's get rid of the 16\\nfrom the left-hand side. So to get rid of it, we're going\\nto subtract 16 from both sides of this equation. Subtract 16 from both sides. The left-hand side of the\\nequation just becomes-- you have this 3x here; these 16's\\ncancel out, you don't have to write anything-- is equal to\\nnegative 32 minus 16 is negative 48. So we have 3x is equal\\nto negative 48. To isolate the x, we can just\\ndivide both sides of this equation by 3. So let's divide both sides\\nof that equation by 3. The left-hand side of the\\nequation, 3x divided by 3 is just an x. That was the whole point\\nbehind dividing both sides by 3. And the right-hand side,\\nnegative 48 divided by 3 is negative 16. And we are done. x equals negative 16\\nis our solution. So let's make sure that this\\nactually works by substituting to the original equation\\nup here. And the original equation\\ndidn't have those 8's out front. So let's substitute in the\\noriginal equation. We get 3/4-- 3 over 4-- times\\nnegative 16 plus 2 needs to be equal to 3/8 times negative\\n16 minus 4. So 3/4 of 16 is 12. And you can think\\nof it this way. What's 16 divided by 4? It is 4. And then multiply that\\nby 3, it's 12, just multiplying fractions. So this is going to\\nbe a negative 12. So we get negative 12 plus\\n2 on the left-hand side, negative 12 plus 2\\nis negative 10. So the left-hand side\\nis a negative 10. Let's see what the right-hand\\nside is. You have 3/8 times\\nnegative 16. If you divide negative 16 by 8,\\nyou get negative 2, times 3 is a negative 6. So it's a negative 6 minus 4. Negative 6 minus 4\\nis negative 10. So when x is equal to negative\\n16, it does satisfy the original equation. Both sides of the equation\\nbecome negative 10. And we are done. \",\n",
       " '2.1.5': \"So I have the equation 7 minus\\n10/x is equal to 2 plus 15/x. And so this isn't\\nthe type of equation that you might think that\\nyou're used to solving. But I'll give you a\\nfew moments to see if you can solve it on your own. Well, what we'll see is we\\ncan do a quick multiplication of both sides to actually\\nsimplify this to a form that we are more\\nused to looking at. So what's probably bothering\\nyou, because it's bothering me, is these x's that we have in the\\ndenominators right over here. We're like, well, how\\ndo we deal with that? Well, whenever we see\\nan x in the denominator, the temptation is\\nto multiply it by x. But we can't just multiply\\none of the terms by x. We have to multiply\\nthe entire side by x. So we could multiply\\nthis entire side by x. But we can't just multiply\\nthe left-hand side by x. We'd also want to multiply\\nthe right-hand side by x. And so what will that give us? Well, we distribute the x. We get x times 7 is 7x. And then x times\\nnegative 10/x, well, that's just going\\nto be negative 10. So you get negative\\n10 right over there. So the left-hand side\\nsimplifies to 7x minus 10. And then your right-hand\\nside, once again, distribute the x.\\nx times 2 is 2x. x times 15/x, well,\\nx times something over x is just going to be\\nthe something. x times 15/x is just going to\\nbe 15-- plus 15. So now we've simplified\\nthis to a linear equation. We have the variable\\non both sides. So we just have to do\\nsome of the techniques that we already know. So the first thing\\nthat I like to do is maybe get all my x's\\non the left-hand side. So I want to get rid of\\nthis 2x right over here. So I subtract 2x from\\nthe right-hand side. Now, and I always remind\\nyou, I can't do that just to the right-hand side. If I did it just to\\nthe right-hand side, it wouldn't be an\\nequality anymore. You have to do that to the\\nleft-hand side as well. And so we are left with-- let\\nme get that pink color again. On the left-hand side, 7x, 7 of\\nsomething minus 2 of something, well, you're going to have 5\\nof that something, minus 10. These two x's negate each other. And you're left with equals 15. Now we can get rid\\nof this negative 10 by adding 10 to both sides. You know, I like\\nthat green color when I do stuff to both sides. So I can add 10 to both sides. And I'm left with\\n5x-- these negate each other-- is equal to 25. And this is the home stretch. You see where this is going. We can divide both sides by 5. And we are left with\\nx is equal to 5. Now let's verify that\\nthis actually worked. So let's go back to\\nthe original equation. We have 7 minus 10/5. This needs to be\\nequal to-- I'm just taking our 5 and\\nsubstituting it back here. This needs to be\\nequal to 2 plus 15/5. So this is 7 minus 10/5. This is just 2. It needs to be equal to 2\\nplus 15/5, which is just 3. So 2 plus 3, 7 minus\\n2 is 5, 2 plus 3 is 5, 5 is indeed equal to 5. And we are done. \",\n",
       " '2.2.1': \"We have the equation negative 9\\nminus this whole expression, 9x minus 6-- this whole thing\\nis being subtracted from negative 9-- is equal to\\n3 times this whole expression, 4x plus 6. Now, a good place to start is\\nto just get rid of these parentheses. And the best way to get rid of\\nthese parentheses is to kind of multiply them out. This has a negative 1-- you\\njust see a minus here, but it's just really the same thing\\nas having a negative 1-- times this quantity. And here you have a 3\\ntimes this quantity. So let's multiply it out using\\nthe distributive property. So the left-hand side of\\nour equation, we have our negative 9. And then we want to multiply the\\nnegative 1 times each of these terms. So negative 1 times\\n9x is negative 9x, and then negative 1 times negative\\n6 is plus 6, or positive 6. And then that is going to be\\nequal to-- let's distribute the 3-- 3 times 4x is 12x. And then 3 times 6 is 18. Now what we want to do, let's\\ncombine our constant terms, if we can. We have a negative 9 and a 6\\nhere, on this side, we've combined all of our like terms.\\nWe can't combine a 12x and an 18, so let's\\ncombine this. So let's combine the negative 9\\nand the 6, our two constant terms on the left-hand\\nside of the equation. So we're going to have\\nthis negative 9x. So we're going to have negative\\n9x plus-- let's see, we have a negative 9 and then\\nplus 6-- so negative 9 plus 6 is negative 3. So we're going to have a\\nnegative 9x, and then we have a negative 3, so minus\\n3 right here. That's the negative 9 plus\\nthe 6, and that is equal to 12x plus 18. Now, we want to group all the\\nx terms on one side of the equation, and all of the\\nconstant terms-- the negative 3 and the positive 18 on the\\nother side-- I like to always have my x terms on the left-hand\\nside, if I can. You don't have to have them on\\nthe left, so let's do that. So if I want all my x terms on\\nthe left, I have to get rid of this 12x from the right. And the best way to do that is\\nto subtract 12x from both sides of the equation. So let me subtract 12x from the\\nright, and subtract 12x from the left. Now, on the left-hand side, I\\nhave negative 9x minus 12x. So negative 9 minus 12,\\nthat's negative 21. Negative 21x minus 3 is equal\\nto-- 12x minus 12x, well, that's just nothing. That's 0. So I could write a 0\\nhere, but I don't have to write anything. That was the whole point of\\nsubtracting the 12x from the left-hand side. And that is going to be equal\\nto-- so on the right-hand side, we just are\\nleft with an 18. We are just left with\\nthat 18 here. These guys canceled out. Now, let's get rid of\\nthis negative 3 from the left-hand side. So on the left-hand side, we\\nonly have x terms, and on the right-hand side, we only have\\nconstant terms. So the best way to cancel out a negative\\n3 is to add 3. So it cancels out to 0. So we're going to add\\n3 to the left, let's add 3 to the right. And we get-- the left-hand side\\nof the equation, we have the negative 21x, no other x\\nterm to add or subtract here, so we have negative 21x. The negative 3 and the plus 3,\\nor the positive 3, cancel out-- that was the whole\\npoint-- equals-- what's 18 plus 3? 18 plus 3 is 21. So now we have negative\\n21x is equal to 21. And we want to solve for x. So if you have something times\\nx, and you just want it to be an x, let's divide by\\nthat something. And in this case, that something\\nis negative 21. So let's divide both sides of\\nthis equation by negative 21. Divide both sides\\nby negative 21. The left-hand side, negative\\n21 divided by negative 21, you're just left with an x. That was the whole point behind dividing by negative 21. And we get x is equal\\nto-- what's 21 divided by negative 21? Well, that's just negative 1. Right? You have the positive version\\ndivided by the negative version of itself, so it's\\njust negative 1. So that is our answer. Now let's verify that this\\nactually works for that original equation. So let's substitute negative 1\\ninto that original equation. So we have negative 9-- I'll do\\nit over here; I'll do it in a different color than we've\\nbeen using-- we have negative 9 minus-- that 1 wasn't there\\noriginally, it's there implicitly-- minus 9\\ntimes negative 1. 9 times-- I'll put negative 1\\nin parentheses-- minus 6 is equal to-- well, actually,\\nlet me just solve for the left-hand side when I substitute\\na negative 1 there. So the left-hand side becomes\\nnegative 9, minus 9 times negative 1 is negative\\n9, minus 6. And so this is negative 9\\nminus-- in parentheses-- negative 9 minus 6\\nis negative 15. So this is equal\\nto negative 15. And so we get negative 9-- let\\nme make sure I did that-- negative 9 minus 6,\\nyep, negative 15. So negative 9 minus negative 15,\\nthat's the same thing as negative 9 plus 15,\\nwhich is 6. So that's what we get on the\\nleft-hand side of the equation when we substitute x is\\nequal to negative 1. We get that it equals 6. So let's see what happens when\\nwe substitute negative 1 to the right-hand side\\nof the equation. I'll do it in green. We get 3 times 4 times\\nnegative 1 plus 6. So that is 3 times negative\\n4 plus 6. Negative 4 plus 6 is 2. So it's 3 times 2,\\nwhich is also 6. So when x is equal to negative\\n1, you substitute here, the left-hand side becomes 6, and\\nthe right-hand side becomes 6. So this definitely works out. \",\n",
       " '2.2.2': \"- [Instructor] In many other videos, we've taken equations like this and tried to quote solve for X. What we're gonna do in\\nthis video is deepen our understanding a little\\nbit about what's going on and really think about\\nthe notion of equivalence or equivalence statements. So let me write that down, equivalence. Now, what do I mean by equivalence? Well, I'll use this equation here to essentially keep rewriting\\nit in equivalent ways and I'll talk a little bit\\nmore about what that means. So one thing that I\\ncould do to essentially write the same equivalence statement is I could distribute\\nthis three onto the X or onto the X plus one\\nand then this part of it could be rewritten as three X plus three and then we have minus X is equal to nine. Now, what I will say or what\\nit might be obvious to you on some level is this top equation and this second equation are equivalent. What does that mean? It means if one of them\\nis true for given X, the other one will be true\\nfor that same X as well, and vice versa and we can write other equivalence statements. For example, if we were\\nto combine X terms, if we were to take three\\nX and then minus X, right over there, I could\\nrewrite that as two X and then I have plus\\nthree is equal to nine. Now all three of these\\nstatements are equivalent. If there's an X where two times that X plus three is equal to nine, then it is also the case that\\nthree times that X plus one minus X is equal to nine and vice versa. If there's some X that would\\nmake this top equation true then it's going to make\\nthis last equation true. And we can do other equivalence\\npreserving operations and you've seen them before. You could subtract three from both sides. In general, if you are adding\\nor subtracting the same value from both sides, it is\\nequivalence preserving. If you're distributing a value like we did in that first step that\\nis equivalence preserving. If you combine like terms so to speak, that is equivalence preserving and so here we'll do an\\nequivalence preserving operation. We'll subtract three from both sides and you would get two X is equal to six and once again, any X that\\nsatisfies this last equation will satisfy any of the other\\nequations and vice versa. Any X that's satisfies any\\nof these other equations will satisfy this last one and so they are all\\nequivalent to each other. And then another equivalence\\npreserving operation is to multiply or divide both\\nsides by a non zero constant. And so here we could\\ndivide both sides by two, two is not zero and it's constant and if we did that, we will get\\nanother equivalent statement that X is equal to three. So any X that satisfies this\\nand there's one, X equals three would satisfy the other ones\\nand any X that satisfies any of the other ones\\nwould satisfy this last one so these are all equivalent. So one way to think about it, adding the same number to\\nboth sides of an equation that is equivalence preserving. Multiply or dividing both sides\\nby a non-zero constant value is equivalence preserving. Distributing like we\\ndid in this first step equivalence preserving,\\ncombining like terms equivalence preserving. Now you're probably saying, well, what are some non\\nequivalence preserving operations? Well, imagine something like this, lemme just start with\\nsomething very obvious. If I said that X is equal to two a non equivalence preserving operation is if I were to add or\\nsubtract or multiply or divide only one side of this equation by a value let's say I only added\\none to the left side. Then I would have X\\nplus one is equal to two and it is not the case that\\nanything that satisfies this second equation\\nsatisfies the top equation or vice versa. X equals two clearly\\nsatisfies the top equation but it doesn't satisfy the second one, that's because we did a non equivalence preserving operation. Likewise, if I only multiplied\\nthe right hand side by three, I would get X is equal to six. Well, by only multiplying\\nthe right hand side by value it's not the case that anything\\nthat satisfies X equals six will satisfy X equals two,\\nthat is somewhat obvious here. Now there's a little\\nbit trickier scenarios, let's say we have the equation\\nfive X is equal to six X. Now, one temptation is, well,\\nI wanna do the same thing to both sides, I could just\\ndivide both sides by X, what'll happen in that scenario? Well, if you divide both sides by X you could think that an\\nequivalence statement is that five is equal to six\\nand you know that there's no X for which five is equal to six. You can't make five equal\\nsix or six equal five and so this would somehow\\nmake you imply that okay, there's no X that can satisfy. If you assume that these\\nwere equivalence statements, you'd say there's nothing that\\ncould satisfy five equal six so maybe there's nothing that\\nsatisfies this top equation. But this actually isn't an\\nequivalence preserving operation because you're actually\\ndealing with a scenario where X is equal to zero\\nand you're dividing by zero. And so you have to be very careful when you're dividing by a variable, especially if the variable\\nthat makes that equation true happens to be zero. And so in order to be clear that you're preserving equivalence here, the way that I would tackle it is I would subtract five X from both sides and if you do that, and\\nthat is an equivalence preserving operation, you\\ncould subtract that expression from both sides or that\\nterm from both sides and then you would be left\\nwith zero is equal to X and now zero equals X\\nand five X equals six X, these are equivalence statements. They are equivalent equations anything that makes this\\none true is going to make that one true and anyone\\nthat makes that one true is going to make this one true. Now one last thing you\\nmight have heard me say, you can multiply or\\ndivide by non-zero value and that's going to be\\nequivalence preserving. And hopefully you've just got a sense of why dividing by zero\\nis not a good idea. In fact, dividing by zero\\nis always going to be a strange thing and it's undefined, but also multiplying by zero. For example, if I had, let's say, actually lemme start over here. If I had two X is equal to\\nsix, and if I were to multiply both sides by zero, I would\\nget zero is equal to zero and zero equals zero is true for any X. Zero is always going to be equal to zero but the problem is, is that\\nfirst statement isn't true for all X it's only\\ntrue for X equals three. So these two are not\\nequivalent statements. They have a different set\\nof Xs that will satisfy them and so you have to be very\\ncareful when you're dealing with things that are either are zero you can add or subtract zeros, obviously that's not\\ngonna change things much, but when you multiply both sides by zero, you can start getting things that are not equivalence statements and when you multiply or divide by things that could be zero, like variables, that also is a dangerous game to play. \",\n",
       " '2.3.1': \"Determine the\\nnumber of solutions for each of these\\nequations, and they give us three equations right over here. And before I deal with these\\nequations in particular, let's just remind\\nourselves about when we might have one or\\ninfinite or no solutions. You're going to\\nhave one solution if you can, by\\nsolving the equation, come up with something like\\nx is equal to some number. Let's say x is\\nequal to-- if I want to say the abstract--\\nx is equal to a. Or if we actually\\nwere to solve it, we'd get something like x\\nequals 5 or 10 or negative pi-- whatever it might be. But if you could actually\\nsolve for a specific x, then you have one solution. So this is one solution,\\njust like that. Now if you go and you try to\\nmanipulate these equations in completely legitimate\\nways, but you end up with something crazy\\nlike 3 equals 5, then you have no solutions. And if you just think\\nabout it reasonably, all of these equations\\nare about finding an x that satisfies this. And if you were to just\\nkeep simplifying it, and you were to get\\nsomething like 3 equals 5, and you were to ask\\nyourself the question is there any x that can somehow\\nmagically make 3 equal 5, no. No x can magically\\nmake 3 equal 5, so there's no way that you could\\nmake this thing be actually true, no matter\\nwhich x you pick. So if you get something\\nvery strange like this, this means there's no solution. On the other hand, if you get\\nsomething like 5 equals 5-- and I'm just over\\nusing the number 5. It didn't have to\\nbe the number 5. It could be 7 or 10\\nor 113, whatever. And actually let\\nme just not use 5, just to make sure that you\\ndon't think it's only for 5. If I just get something,\\nthat something is equal to itself,\\nwhich is just going to be true no matter what\\nx you pick, any x you pick, this would be true for. Well, then you have\\nan infinite solutions. So with that as a\\nlittle bit of a primer, let's try to tackle\\nthese three equations. So over here, let's see. Maybe we could subtract. If we want to get rid of this\\n2 here on the left hand side, we could subtract\\n2 from both sides. If we subtract 2\\nfrom both sides, we are going to be left\\nwith-- on the left hand side we're going to be\\nleft with negative 7x. And on the right\\nhand side, you're going to be left with 2x. This is going to\\ncancel minus 9x. 2x minus 9x, If we simplify\\nthat, that's negative 7x. You get negative 7x is\\nequal to negative 7x. And you probably see\\nwhere this is going. This is already true\\nfor any x that you pick. Negative 7 times that x is going\\nto be equal to negative 7 times that x. So we already are going\\ninto this scenario. But you're like hey, so\\nI don't see 13 equals 13. Well, what if you did\\nsomething like you divide both sides by negative 7. At this point, what I'm\\ndoing is kind of unnecessary. You already understand that\\nnegative 7 times some number is always going to be\\nnegative 7 times that number. But if we were to do this,\\nwe would get x is equal to x, and then we could subtract\\nx from both sides. And then you would\\nget zero equals zero, which is true for\\nany x that you pick. Zero is always going\\nto be equal to zero. So any of these\\nstatements are going to be true for any x you pick. So for this equation\\nright over here, we have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. Let's think about this one\\nright over here in the middle. So once again, let's try it. I'll do it a little\\nbit different. I'll add this 2x and this\\nnegative 9x right over there. So we will get negative 7x\\nplus 3 is equal to negative 7x. So 2x plus 9x is\\nnegative 7x plus 2. Well, let's add-- why don't we\\ndo that in that green color. Let's do that in\\nthat green color. Plus 2, this is 2. Now let's add 7x to both sides. Well if you add 7x to\\nthe left hand side, you're just going to\\nbe left with a 3 there. And if you add 7x to\\nthe right hand side, this is going to go\\naway and you're just going to be left with a 2 there. So all I did is I added 7x. I added 7x to both\\nsides of that equation. And now we've got\\nsomething nonsensical. I don't care what x you pick,\\nhow magical that x might be. There's no way that that x is\\ngoing to make 3 equal to 2. So in this scenario right over\\nhere, we have no solutions. There's no x in the universe\\nthat can satisfy this equation. Now let's try this\\nthird scenario. So once again, maybe we'll\\nsubtract 3 from both sides, just to get rid of\\nthis constant term. So we're going to get negative\\n7x on the left hand side. On the right hand side, we're\\ngoing to have 2x minus 1. And now we can subtract\\n2x from both sides. To subtract 2x from\\nboth sides, you're going to get-- so\\nsubtracting 2x, you're going to get negative\\n9x is equal to negative 1. Now you can divide both\\nsides by negative 9. And you are left with\\nx is equal to 1/9. So we're in this\\nscenario right over here. We very explicitly\\nwere able to find an x, x equals 1/9, that\\nsatisfies this equation. So this right over here\\nhas exactly one solution. \",\n",
       " '2.3.2': \"Solve for x. We have 8 times the\\nquantity 3x plus 10 is equal to 28x\\nminus 14 minus 4x. So like every equation\\nwe've done so far, we just want to isolate\\nall of the x's on one side of this equation. But before we do\\nthat, we can actually simplify each of these sides. On the left-hand\\nside, we can multiply the quantity 3x plus 10 times 8. So we're essentially\\njust distributing the 8, the distributive\\nproperty right here. So this is the same thing\\nas 8 times 3x, which is 24x, plus 8 times 10, which\\nis 80, is equal to-- and over here, we have\\n28x minus 14 minus 4x. So we can combine the\\n28x and the minus 4x. If we have 28x minus\\n4x, that is 24x And then you have the\\nminus 14 right over here. Now, the next thing we\\ncould-- and it's already looking a little bit suspicious,\\nbut just to confirm that it's as suspicious as\\nit looks, let's try to subtract 24x from both\\nsides of this equation. And if we do that, we see that\\nwe actually remove the x's from both sides of the equation\\nbecause we have a 24x there, and we have a 24x there. You might say,\\nhey, let's put all the x's on the left-hand side. So let's get rid of this 24x. So you subtract 24x\\nright over there, but you have to do it to\\nthe left-hand side as well. On the left-hand side,\\nthese guys cancel out, and you're left with just\\n80-- these guys cancel out as well-- is equal\\nto a negative 14. Now, this looks very bizarre. It's making a statement that\\n80 is equal to negative 14, which we know is not true. This does not happen. 80 is never equal\\nto negative 14. They're just inherently inequal. So this equation right here\\nactually has no solution. This has no solution. There is a no x-value that will\\nmake 80 equal to negative 14. \",\n",
       " '2.4.1': \"- [Voiceover] So we have an equation. It says, a-x plus three-x\\nis equal to b-x plus five. And what I want to do\\ntogether is to solve for x, and if we solve for x it's going to be in terms of a, b, and other numbers. So pause the video and\\nsee if you can do that. All right now, let's do this together, and what I'm going to do, is I'm gonna try to\\ngroup all of the x-terms, let's group all the x-terms\\non the left-hand side. So, I already have a-x and\\nthree-x on the left-hand side. Let's get b-x onto the left-hand\\nside as well, and I can do that by subtracting b-x from both sides. And if I subtract b-x from both sides, I'm going to get on the right-hand side, I'm going to have a, or\\non the left-hand side, a-x plus three-x minus b-x, so I can do\\nthat in that color for fun, minus b-x, and that's\\ngoing to be equal to... Well, b-x minus b-x is just zero, and I have five. It is equal to five. And now what I can do is, I can factor an x out\\nof this left-hand side of this equation, out of all of the terms. So, I can rewrite this as x times... Well, a-x divided by x is a. Three-x divided by x is three, and then negative b-x divided by x is just going to be negative b. I could keep writing\\nit in that pink color. And that's all going to be equal to five. And now, to solve for x I can just divide both sides by, the thing that\\nx is being multiplied by, by a plus three minus b. So, I can divide both sides by a plus three minus b. A plus three minus b. On this side, they cancel out. And, I have x is equal to five over a plus three minus b, and we are done. Let's do one more of these. So, another equation here. We have a... Here we have a times the\\nquantity, five minus x, is equal to b-x minus eight. So, once again, pause the video and see if you can solve for x. Well, the way I like to approach these is let's just expand everything all out. So, let me just distribute this a, and then I'm gonna collect\\nall the x-terms on one side, and all of the non-x-terms\\non the other side, and essentially do what I\\njust did in the last example. So, let's first distribute this a. So the left-hand side becomes five-a, I could say a\\ntimes five or five-a, minus a-x, a-x, that is going to be equal to b-x minus eight. Now we can subtract b-x from both sides. So, we're gonna subtract\\nb-x from the left-hand side, b-x from the right-hand side. And, once again, the whole\\nreason I'm doing that, I want all the x-terms on the left, and all the non-x-terms on the right. And, actually, since I want all\\nthe non-x-terms on the right, I can actually subtract five-a\\nfrom both sides, as well. So I'm kind of doing\\ntwo steps at once, here, but hopefully it makes sense. I'm trying to get rid of the b-x here, and I'm trying to get\\nrid of the five-a here. So, I subtract five-a there, and I'll subtract five-a there, and then let's see what this give us. So, the five-a's cancel out. And, on the left-hand side, I have negative a-x, negative a-x, minus b-x, minus, you know, in that same green color, minus b-x. And on the right-hand side, I have... This is going to be equal to, the b-x's cancel out, and I have negative eight minus five-a. Negative eight minus, in that same magenta color, minus five-a. And let's see, I have all my x's on one side, all my\\nnon-x's on the other side. And here I can factor out an x, and if I factor out an x, what do I have? And, actually, one thing\\nthat might be nice. Let me just multiply both\\nsides by negative one. If I multiple both sides by negative one, I get a-x plus b-x, plus b-x is equal to eight plus five-a. That just gets rid of all\\nof those negative signs. And now I can factor out an x here. So let me factor out an x, and I get x times a plus b. A plus b is going to be equal to eight plus five-a. Eight plus five-a. And we're in the home stretch now. We can just divide both sides by a plus b. So we could divide both sides by a plus b. A plus b. And we're going to be left with, x is equal to eight plus five-a, plus five-a, over... Actually, I'll write a and\\nb in our original colors. A plus, so this was that a, that a, plus b. So this is the b, that's a and b, a plus b, and we're done. We have now solved for x in terms of a's and b's and other things. And we are all done. \",\n",
       " '2.5.1': \"We're asked to solve for p. And we have the inequality\\nhere negative 3p minus 7 is less than p plus 9. So what we really want\\nto do is isolate the p on one side of this inequality. And preferably the\\nleft-- that just makes it just a little easier to read. It doesn't have to be, but we\\njust want to isolate the p. So a good step to\\nthat is to get rid of this p on the\\nright-hand side. And the best way I can\\nthink of doing that is subtracting p from the right. But of course, if\\nwe want to make sure that this inequality is\\nalways going to be true, if we do anything to\\nthe right, we also have to do that to the left. So we also have to\\nsubtract p from the left. And so the left-hand side,\\nnegative 3p minus p-- that's negative 4p. And then we still have\\na minus 7 up here-- is going to be less than p minus p. Those cancel out. It is less than 9. Now the next thing\\nI'm in the mood to do is get rid of this\\nnegative 7, or this minus 7 here, so that we\\ncan better isolate the p on the left-hand side. So the best way I can think\\nof to get rid of a negative 7 is to add 7 to it. Then it will just\\ncancel out to 0. So let's add 7 to both\\nsides of this inequality. Negative 7 plus 7 cancel out. All we're left with\\nis negative 4p. On the right-hand side, we\\nhave 9 plus 7 equals 16. And it's still less than. Now, the last step\\nto isolate the p is to get rid of this\\nnegative 4 coefficient. And the easiest way I\\ncan think of to get rid of this negative\\n4 coefficient is to divide both\\nsides by negative 4. So if we divide this\\nside by negative 4, these guys are\\ngoing to cancel out. We're just going\\nto be left with p. We also have to do it\\nto the right-hand side. Now, there's one thing that\\nyou really have to remember, since this is an\\ninequality, not an equation. If you're dealing\\nwith an inequality and you multiply or divide\\nboth sides of an equation by a negative number, you\\nhave to swap the inequality. So in this case, the less\\nthan becomes greater than, since we're dividing\\nby a negative number. And so negative 4 divided by\\nnegative 4-- those cancel out. We have p is greater than\\n16 divided by negative 4, which is negative 4. And we can plot this\\nsolution set right over here. And then we can\\ntry out some values to help us feel good about\\nthe idea of it working. So let's say this is negative\\n5, negative 4, negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, 0. Let me write that a\\nlittle bit neater. And then we can keep\\ngoing to the right. And so our solution is p is\\nnot greater than or equal, so we have to\\nexclude negative 4. p is greater than negative 4,\\nso all the values above that. So negative 3.9999999 will work. Negative 4 will not work. And let's just try\\nsome values out to feel good that this is\\nreally the solution set. So first let's try out when\\np is equal to negative 3. This should work. The way I've drawn it,\\nthis is in our solution set. p equals negative 3\\nis greater than negative 4. So let's try that out. We have negative 3\\ntimes negative 3. The first negative\\n3 is this one, and then we're saying\\np is negative 3. Minus 7 should be less\\nthan-- instead of a p, we're going to\\nputting a negative 3. Should be less than\\nnegative 3 plus 9. Negative 3 times\\nnegative 3 is 9, minus 7 should be less than\\nnegative 3 plus 9 is 6. 9 minus 7 is 2. 2 should be less than 6,\\nwhich, of course, it is. Now let's try a value that\\ndefinitely should not work. So let's try negative 5. Negative 5 is not\\nin our solution set, so it should not work. So we have negative 3\\ntimes negative 5 minus 7. Let's see whether it is\\nless than negative 5 plus 9. Negative 3 times negative\\n5 is 15, minus 7. It really should not be\\nless than negative 5 plus 9. So we're just seeing if p\\nequals negative 5 works. 15 minus 7 is 8. And so we get 8 is\\nless than 4, which is definitely not the case. So p equals negative\\n5 doesn't work. And it shouldn't work, because\\nthat's not in our solution set. And now if we really want\\nto feel good about it, we can actually try\\nthis boundary point. Negative 4 should\\nnot work, but it should satisfy the\\nrelated equation. When I talk about\\nthe related equation, negative 4 should satisfy\\nnegative 3 minus 7 is equal to p plus 9. It'll satisfy this, but\\nit won't satisfy this. Because when we get the\\nsame value on both sides, the same value is not\\nless than the same value. So let's try it out. Let's see whether\\nnegative 4 at least satisfies the related equation. So if we get negative 3\\ntimes negative 4 minus 7, this should be equal\\nto negative 4 plus 9. So this is 12 minus 7 should\\nbe equal to negative 4 plus 9. It should be equal to 5. And this, of course, is true. 5 is equal to 5. So it satisfies the\\nrelated equation, but it should not satisfy this. If you put negative\\n4 for p here-- and I encourage you to do so. Actually, we could\\ndo it over here. Instead of an equals\\nsign, if you put it into the original inequality--\\nlet me delete all of that-- it really just becomes this. The original inequality\\nis this right over here. If you put negative\\n4, you have less than. And then you get 5 is less\\nthan 5, which is not the case. And that's good,\\nbecause we did not include that in\\nthe solution set. We put an open circle. If negative 4 was included,\\nwe would fill that in. But the only reason why\\nwe'd include negative 4 is if this was\\ngreater than or equal. So it's good that this does\\nnot work, because negative 4 is not part of our solution set. You can kind of view\\nit as a boundary point. \",\n",
       " '2.5.2': 'Solve for x. And we have 5x plus 7 is greater than 3 times x plus 1. So let\\'s just try to isolate \"x\" on one side of this inequality. But before we do that, let\\'s just simplify this righthand side. so we get 5x plus 7 is greater than - let\\'s distribute this 3. So 3 times x plus 1 is the same thing as 3 times x plus 3 times 1 so it\\'s going to be 3x plus 3 times 1 is 3. Now if we want to put our x\\'s on the lefthand side, we can subtract 3x from both sides. That will get rid of this 3x on the righthand side. So let\\'s do that. Let\\'s subtract 3x from both sides, and we get on the lefthand side: 5x minus 3x is 2x plus 7 is greater than - 3x minus 3x - those cancel out. That was the whole point behind subtracting 3x from both sides - is greater than 3. Is greater than 3. No we can subtract 7 from both sides to get rid of this positive 7 right over here. So, let\\'s subtract, let\\'s subtract 7 from both sides. And we get on the lefthand side... 2x plus 7 minus 7 is just 2x. Is greater than 3 minus 7 which is negative 4. And then let\\'s see, we have 2x is greater than negative 4. If we just want an x over here, we can just divide both sides by 2. Since 2 is a positive number, we don\\'t have to swap the inequality. So let\\'s just divide both sides by 2, and we get x is greater than negative 4 divide by 2 is negative 2. So the solution will look like this. Draw the number line. I can draw a straighter number line than that. There we go. Still not that great, but it will serve our purposes. Let\\'s say that\\'s -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. X is greater than negative 2. It does not include negative 2. It is not greater than or equal to negative 2, so we have to exclude negative 2. And we exclude negative 2 by drawing an open circle at negative 2, but all the values greater than that are valid x\\'s that would solve, that would satisfy this inequality. So anything above it - anything above it will work. And let\\'s just try, let\\'s try just try something that should work. and then let\\'s try something that shouldn\\'t work. So 0 should work. It is greater than negative 2. It\\'s right over here. So, let\\'s verify that. 5 times 0 plus 7 should be greater than 3 times 0 plus 1. So this is 7 - \\'cause this is just a 0 - 7 should be greater than 3. Right. 3 times 1. So 7 should be greater than 3, and it definitely is. Now let\\'s try something that should not work. Let\\'s try negative 3. So 5 times negative 3... 5 times negative 3 plus 7, let\\'s see if it is greater than 3 times negative 3 plus 1. So this is negative 15 plus 7 is negative 8 That is negative 8. Let\\'s see if that is greater than negative 3 plus 1 is negative 2 times 3 is negative 6. Negative 8 is not - is not greater than negative 6. Negative 8 is more negative than negative 6. It\\'s less than. So, it is good that negative 3 didn\\'t work \\'cause we didn\\'t include that in our solution set. So we tried something that is in our solution set and it did work. And something that is not, and it didn\\'t work. So we are feeling pretty good. ',\n",
       " '2.5.3': \"Let's do a few more problems\\nthat bring together the concepts that we learned\\nin the last two videos. So let's say we have the\\ninequality 4x plus 3 is less than negative 1. So let's find all of the\\nx's that satisfy this. So the first thing I'd like to\\ndo is get rid of this 3. So let's subtract 3 from both\\nsides of this equation. So the left-hand side is just\\ngoing to end up being 4x. These 3's cancel out. That just ends up with a zero. No reason to change the\\ninequality just yet. We're just adding and\\nsubtracting from both sides, in this case, subtracting. That doesn't change the\\ninequality as long as we're subtracting the same value. We have negative 1 minus 3. That is negative 4. Negative 1 minus 3\\nis negative 4. And then we'll want to-- let's\\nsee, we can divide both sides of this equation by 4. Once again, when you multiply\\nor divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number,\\nit doesn't change the inequality. So the left-hand\\nside is just x. x is less than negative 4\\ndivided by 4 is negative 1. x is less than negative 1. Or we could write this\\nin interval notation. All of the x's from negative\\ninfinity to negative 1, but not including negative\\n1, so we put a parenthesis right there. Let's do a slightly\\nharder one. Let's say we have 5x is greater\\nthan 8x plus 27. So let's get all our x's on the\\nleft-hand side, and the best way to do that is subtract\\n8x from both sides. So you subtract 8x\\nfrom both sides. The left-hand side becomes\\n5x minus 8x. That's negative 3x. We still have a greater\\nthan sign. We're just adding or subtracting\\nthe same quantities on both sides. These 8x's cancel out and you're\\njust left with a 27. So you have negative 3x\\nis greater than 27. Now, to just turn this into an\\nx, we want to divide both sides by negative 3. But remember, when you multiply\\nor divide both sides of an inequality by a negative\\nnumber, you swap the inequality. So if we divide both sides of\\nthis by negative 3, we have to swap this inequality. It will go from being\\na greater than sign to a less than sign. And just as a bit of a way that\\nI remember greater than is that the left-hand side\\njust looks bigger. This is greater than. If you just imagine this height,\\nthat height is greater than that height right there,\\nwhich is just a point. I don't know if that confuses\\nyou or not. This is less than. This little point\\nis less than the distance of that big opening. That's how I remember it. But anyway, 3x over\\nnegative 3. So now that we divided both\\nsides by a negative number, by negative 3, we swapped the\\ninequality from greater than to less than. And the left-hand side, the\\nnegative 3's cancel out. You get x is less than\\n27 over negative 3, which is negative 9. Or in interval notation, it\\nwould be everything from negative infinity to negative\\n9, not including negative 9. If you wanted to do it\\nas a number line, it would look like this. This would be negative 9, maybe\\nthis would be negative 8, maybe this would\\nbe negative 10. You would start at negative 9,\\nnot included, because we don't have an equal sign here, and\\nyou go everything less than that, all the way down, as we\\nsee, to negative infinity. Let's do a nice,\\nhairy problem. So let's say we have 8x minus\\n5 times 4x plus 1 is greater than or equal to negative 1\\nplus 2 times 4x minus 3. Now, this might seem very\\ndaunting, but if we just simplify it step by step, you'll\\nsee it's no harder than any of the other problems\\nwe've tackled. So let's just simplify this. You get 8x minus-- let's\\ndistribute this negative 5. So let me say 8x, and then\\ndistribute the negative 5. Negative 5 times 4x\\nis negative 20x. Negative 5-- when I say negative\\n5, I'm talking about this whole thing. Negative 5 times 1 is negative\\n5, and then that's going to be greater than or equal\\nto negative 1 plus 2 times 4x is 8x. 2 times negative 3\\nis negative 6. And now we can merge these two\\nterms. 8x minus 20x is negative 12x minus 5 is greater\\nthan or equal to-- we can merge these constant terms.\\nNegative 1 minus 6, that's negative 7, and then we\\nhave this plus 8x left over. Now, I like to get all my x\\nterms on the left-hand side, so let's subtract 8x from both\\nsides of this equation. I'm subtracting 8x. This left-hand side, negative\\n12 minus 8, that's negative 20. Negative 20x minus 5. Once again, no reason\\nto change the inequality just yet. All we're doing is simplifying\\nthe sides, or adding and subtracting from them. The right-hand side becomes--\\nthis thing cancels out, 8x minus 8x, that's 0. So you're just left\\nwith a negative 7. And now I want to get rid\\nof this negative 5. So let's add 5 to both sides\\nof this equation. The left-hand side, you're just\\nleft with a negative 20x. These 5's cancel out. No reason to change the\\ninequality just yet. Negative 7 plus 5, that's\\nnegative 2. Now, we're at an interesting\\npoint. We have negative 20x is greater\\nthan or equal to negative 2. If this was an equation, or\\nreally any type of an inequality, we want to divide\\nboth sides by negative 20. But we have to remember, when\\nyou multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a\\nnegative number, you have to swap the inequality. So let's remember that. So if we divide this side by\\nnegative 20 and we divide this side by negative 20, all I did\\nis took both of these sides divided by negative 20, we have\\nto swap the inequality. The greater than or equal to has\\nto become a less than or equal sign. And, of course, these cancel\\nout, and you get x is less than or equal to-- the\\nnegatives cancel out-- 2/20 is 1/10. If we were writing it in\\ninterval notation, the upper bound would be 1/10. Notice, we're including it,\\nbecause we have an equal sign, less than or equal, so we're\\nincluding 1/10, and we're going to go all the way down\\nto negative infinity, everything less than\\nor equal to 1/10. This is just another way\\nof writing that. And just for fun, let's\\ndraw the number line. Let's draw the number\\nline right here. This is maybe 0, that is 1. 1/10 might be over here. Everything less than\\nor equal to 1/10. So we're going to include the\\n1/10 and everything less than that is included in\\nthe solution set. And you could try out any\\nvalue less than 1/10 and verify that it will satisfy\\nthis inequality. \",\n",
       " '2.5.4': \"- [Instructor] We're told that\\nKayla wants to visit a friend who lives eight kilometers away. She'll ride the subway as far as she can before walking the rest of the way. First, she needs to buy an\\naccess pass that costs $5.50. There's also a fee of $1.25 per stop. This is an expensive subway. Kayla doesn't want to spend\\nmore than $15 on the trip. So she wants to know the largest number of stops she can afford. Let S represent the number\\nof stops that Kayla buys. So first, pause this video and see if you can write an inequality that describes how many stops, or that describes the\\nsituation that describes that she wants to take\\nas many stops as she can, but she doesn't wanna spend more than $15. All right, now let's do this together. So first, let's just\\nthink about an expression for how much she spends. So no matter what, she's\\ngoing to spend $5.50, so we can write it like this, so $5.50, that's what she's going to spend, even if she doesn't take any stops. And it's $1.25 per stop, and\\nS is the number of stops. So the amount she's going\\nto spend just from the stops is going to be $1.25 times S. So it's going to be plus $1.25 S. This is the upfront she has to spend, and this is how much she's\\ngoing to spend on stop. So this is an S right over here and I wrote a five right next to it, they look kind of similar. And we know that she doesn't\\nwant to spend more than $15. So she's willing to spend up to $15. So this total amount that she spends has to be less than or equal to $15. Or if we didn't write it\\nwith the dollar symbols, we would write 5.50 plus 1.25 S is going to be less than or equal to, or needs to be less than or equal to 15. Now that we've written this inequality, what is the number of stops\\nthat Kayla can afford? What's the largest number of\\nstops that she can afford? Pause this video and\\ntry to figure that out. Well, to figure that out,\\nwe just have to solve for S and then figure out what the largest S is that satisfies the inequality\\nonce we've solved for S. So the first thing I would do is subtract 5.50 from both sides. When we do that, we are\\nleft with 1.25 or $1.25 S is less than or equal to 9.50. And then I would divide\\nboth sides by 1.25. And since I'm dividing both\\nsides by a positive value, it doesn't change the\\ndirection of the inequality, 1.25 and then divide this by 1.25, 9.5 divide by 1.25 is equal to 7.6. So we get that S needs to be\\nless than or equal to 7.6. So we can't take a\\nfractional number of stops. So the largest number of\\nstops that Kayla can take is going to be seven stops. She can't take eight, and she can't take 7 1/2 or 7.6. So the largest number she\\ncan take is seven stops. So she can take as many as seven stops. And we are done. \",\n",
       " '2.6.1': \"Solve for z. 5z plus 7 is less\\nthan 27 or negative 3z is less than or equal to 18. So this is a\\ncompound inequality. We have two conditions here. So z can satisfy this or z\\ncan satisfy this over here. So let's just solve each\\nof these inequalities. And just know that z can\\nsatisfy either of them. So let's just look at this. So if we look at just\\nthis one over here, we have 5z plus 7\\nis less than 27. Let's isolate the z's\\non the left-hand side. So let's subtract 7 from both\\nsides to get rid of this 7 on the left-hand side. And so our left-hand side\\nis just going to be 5z. Plus 7, minus 7--\\nthose cancel out. 5z is less than\\n27 minus 7, is 20. So we have 5z is less than 20. Now we can divide both sides\\nof this inequality by 5. And we don't have to swap\\nthe inequality because we're dividing by a positive number. And so we get z\\nis less than 20/5. z is less than 4. Now, this was only\\none of the conditions. Let's [? look at ?] the\\nother one over here. We have negative 3z is\\nless than or equal to 18. Now, to isolate the\\nz, we could just divide both sides of this\\ninequality by negative 3. But remember, when\\nyou divide or multiply both sides of an inequality\\nby a negative number, you have to swap the inequality. So we could write negative 3z. We're going to divide\\nit by negative 3. And then you have 18. We're going to divide\\nit by negative 3. But we're going to\\nswap the inequality. So the less than or equal\\nwill become greater than or equal to. And so these guys cancel out. Negative 3 divided\\nby negative 3 is 1. So we have z is greater than\\nor equal to 18 over negative 3 is negative 6. And remember, it's this\\nconstraint or this constraint. And this constraint right\\nover here boils down to this. And this one boils down to this. So our solution set--\\nz is less than 4 or z is greater than\\nor equal to negative 6. So let me make this clear. Let me rewrite it. So z could be less than\\n4 or z is greater than or equal to negative 6. It can satisfy\\neither one of these. And this is kind of\\ninteresting here. Let's plot these. So there's a number\\nline right over there. Let's say that 0 is over here. We have 1, 2, 3, 4\\nis right over there. And then negative 6. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. That's negative 6 over there. Now, let's think about\\nz being less than 4. We would put a circle around\\n4, since we're not including 4. And it'd be everything\\nless than 4. Now let's think\\nabout what z being greater than or equal to\\nnegative 6 would mean. That means you can\\ninclude negative 6. And it's everything-- let me\\ndo that in different color. It means you can\\ninclude negative 6. I want to do that--\\noh, here we go. It means you include negative 6. Let me do it in a\\nmore different color. Do it in orange. So z is greater than\\nequal to negative 6. Means you can\\ninclude negative 6. And it's everything greater\\nthan that, including 4. So it's everything\\ngreater than that. So what we see is\\nwe've essentially shaded in the\\nentire number line. Every number will meet either\\none of these constraints or both of them. If we're over here,\\nwe're going to meet both of the constraints. If we're a number\\nout here, we're going to meet this constraint. If we're a number\\ndown here, we're going to meet this constraint. And you could just try it\\nout with a bunch of numbers. 0 will work. 0 plus 7 is 7, which\\nis less than 27. And 3 times 0 is less than 18,\\nso it meets both constraints. If we put 4 here, it should only\\nmeet one of the constraints. Negative 3 times 4 is negative\\n12, which is less than 18. So it meets this constraint, but\\nit won't meet this constraint. Because you do 5\\ntimes 4 plus 7 is 27, which is not less than 27. It's equal to 27. Remember, this is an or. So you just have to meet\\none of the constraints. So 4 meets this constraint. So even 4 works. So it's really the\\nentire number line will satisfy either one or\\nboth of these constraints. \",\n",
       " '2.6.2': 'Solve for y. We have 3y plus 7 is less\\nthan 2y and 4y plus 8 is greater than negative 48. So we have to find\\nall the y\\'s that meet both of these constraints. So let\\'s just solve for y\\nin each of the constraints and just remember that\\nthis \"and\" is here. So we have 3y plus\\n7 is less than 2y. So let\\'s isolate the y\\'s\\non the left-hand side. So let\\'s get rid of this\\n2y on the right-hand side, and we can do that by\\nsubtracting 2y from both sides. So we\\'re going to subtract\\n2y from both sides. The left-hand side, we have\\n3y minus 2y, which is just y, plus 7 is less than 2y minus 2y. And there\\'s nothing else there. That\\'s just going to be 0. And then we can\\nget rid of this 7 here by subtracting\\n7 from both sides. So let\\'s subtract\\n7 from both sides. Left-hand side,\\ny plus 7 minus 7. Those cancel out. We just have y is less than 0\\nminus 7, which is negative 7. So that\\'s one of\\nthe constraints. That\\'s this constraint\\nright over here. Now let\\'s work on\\nthis constraint. We have 4y plus 8 is\\ngreater than negative 48. So let\\'s get rid of the 8\\nfrom the left-hand side. So we can subtract\\n8 from both sides. The left-hand side,\\nwe\\'re just left with a 4y because these guys cancel out. 4y is greater than\\nnegative 48 minus 8. So we\\'re going to go\\nanother 8 negative. So 48 plus 8 would\\nbe a 56, so this is going to be negative 56. And now to isolate the y,\\nwe can divide both sides by positive 4, and we don\\'t\\nhave to swap the inequality since we\\'re dividing\\nby a positive number. So it\\'s divide both\\nsides by 4 over here. So we get y is greater than--\\nwhat is 56/4, or negative 56/4? Let\\'s see. 40 is 10 times 4, and then we\\nhave another 16 to worry about. So it\\'s 14 times 4. So y is greater\\nthan negative 14. Is that right? 4 times 10 is 40,\\n4 times 4 is 16. Yep, 56. So y is greater than negative\\n14 and-- let\\'s remember, we have this \"and\" here-- and\\ny is less than negative 7. So we have to meet both of\\nthese constraints over here. So let\\'s draw them\\non the number line. So I have my number\\nline over here. And let\\'s say negative\\n14 is over here. So you have negative\\n13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7-- that\\'s negative 7-- and\\nthen negative 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. This would be 0,\\nand then you could keep going up more positive. And so we\\'re looking\\nfor all of the y\\'s that are less than negative 7. So let\\'s look at this,\\nless than negative 7. So not including\\nnegative 7, so we\\'ll do an open circle\\naround negative 7, and less than negative 7. And if that was the\\nonly constraint, we would keep going to the left. But we have this other\\nconstraint-- and y has to be greater\\nthan negative 14. So you make a circle\\naround negative 14, and everything that\\'s\\ngreater than that. And if you didn\\'t have\\nthis other constraint, you would keep going. But the y\\'s that\\nsatisfy both of them are all of the y\\'s in between. These are the y\\'s that are\\nboth less than negative 7 and greater than negative 14. And we can verify\\nthat things here work. So let\\'s try some values out. So a value that\\nwould work, well, let me just do\\nnegative 10 is right here, 8, 9, this is negative 10. That should work. So let\\'s try it out. So we\\'d have 3 times\\nnegative 10 plus 7 should be less than 2\\ntimes negative 10. So this is negative 30 plus\\n7 is negative 23, which is indeed less than negative 20. So that works. And negative 10 has to\\nwork for this one as well. So you have 4 times negative 10,\\nwhich is negative 40, plus 8. Negative 40 plus 8 should\\nbe greater than negative 48. Well, negative 40\\nplus 8 is negative 32. We\\'re going 8 in the\\npositive direction, so we\\'re getting less negative. And negative 32 is\\ngreater than negative 48. It\\'s less negative. So this works. So negative 10 works. Now, let\\'s just verify some\\nthings that shouldn\\'t work. So 0 should not work. It\\'s not in the solution set. So let\\'s try it out. We\\'ve got 3 times is 0 plus 7. That would be 7. And 7 is not less than 0. So it would violate this\\ncondition right over here if we put a 0 over here. If you put a negative\\n15 over here, it should violate this\\ncondition right over here because it wasn\\'t in\\nthis guy\\'s solution set. Anyway, hopefully you\\nfound that useful. ',\n",
       " '2.6.3': 'Solve for x, 5x - 3 is less than 12 \"and\" 4x plus 1 is greater than 25. So let\\'s just solve for X in each of these constraints and keep in mind that any x has to satisfy both of them because it\\'s an \"and\" over here so first we have this 5 x minus 3 is less than 12 so if we want to isolate the x we can get rid of this negative 3 here by adding 3 to both sides so let\\'s add 3 to both sides of this inequality. The left-hand side, we\\'re just left with a 5x, the minus 3 and the plus 3 cancel out. 5x is less than 12 plus 3 is 15. Now we can divide both sides by positive 5, that won\\'t swap the inequality since 5 is positive. So we divide both sides by positive 5 and we are left with just from this constraint that x is less than 15 over 5, which is 3. So that constraint over here. But we have the second constraint as well. We have this one, we have 4x plus 1 is greater than 25. So very similarly we can subtract one from both sides to get rid of that one on the left-hand side. And we get 4x, the ones cancel out. is greater than 25 minus one is 24. Divide both sides by positive 4 Don\\'t have to do anything to the inequality since it\\'s a positive number. And we get x is greater than 24 over 4 is 6. And remember there was that \"and\" over here. We have this \"and\". So x has to be less than 3 \"and\" x has to be greater than 6. So already your brain might be realizing that this is a little bit strange. This first constraint says that x needs to be less than 3 so this is 3 on the number line. We\\'re saying x has to be less than 3 so it has to be in this shaded area right over there. This second constraint says that x has to be greater than 6. So if this is 6 over here, it says that x has to greater than 6. It can\\'t even include 6. And since we have this \"and\" here. The only x-es that are a solution for this compound inequality are the ones that satisfy both. The ones that are in the overlap of their solution set. But when you look at it right over here it\\'s clear that there is no overlap. There is no x that is both greater than 6 \"and\" less than 3. So in this situation we have no solution. ',\n",
       " '2.6.4': 'We\\'re asked to solve for x. And we have this\\ncompound inequality here, negative 16 is less than or\\nequal to 3x plus 5, which is less than or equal to 20. And really, there\\'s two\\nways to approach it, which are really the same way. And I\\'ll do both of them. And I\\'ll actually do both\\nof them simultaneously. So one is to just solve\\nthis compound inequality all at once. And I\\'ll just rewrite it. Negative 16 is less than or\\nequal to 3x plus 5, which is less than or equal to 20. And the other way\\nis to think of it as two separate inequalities,\\nbut both of them need to be true. So you could also view it as\\nnegative 16 has to be less than or equal to 3x plus 5. And 3x plus 5 needs to be\\nless than or equal to 20. This statement and this\\nstatement are equivalent. This one may seem a little\\nbit more familiar because we can independently solve\\neach of these inequalities and just remember the \"and.\" This one might seem a little\\nless traditional because now we have three sides\\nto the statement. We have three parts of\\nthis compound inequality. But what we can see\\nis that we\\'re actually going to solve it\\nthe exact same way. In any situation, we really just\\nwant to isolate the x on one side of the inequality,\\nor in this case, one part of the\\ncompound inequality. Well, the best way to\\nisolate this x right here is to first get rid of\\nthis positive 5 that\\'s sitting in the middle. So let\\'s subtract\\n5 from every part of this compound inequality. So I\\'m going to subtract\\n5 there, subtract 5 there, and subtract\\n5 over there. And so we get negative 16\\nminus 5 is negative 21, is less than or equal to 3x\\nplus 5 minus 5 is 3x, which is less than or equal to\\n20 minus 5, which is 15. And we could essentially\\ndo the same thing here. If we want to isolate the 3x, we\\ncan subtract 5 from both sides. We get negative 21. Negative 21 is less\\nthan or equal to 3x. And we get, subtracting\\n5 from both sides. And notice, we\\'re\\njust subtracting 5 from every part of this\\ncompound inequality. We get 3x is less\\nthan or equal to 15. So this statement and this\\nstatement, once again, are the exact same thing. Now, going back here, if\\nwe want to isolate the x, we can divide by 3. And we have to do it to\\nevery part of the inequality. And since 3 is positive, we\\ndon\\'t have to change the sign. So let\\'s divide every part of\\nthis compound inequality by 3. You divide every part by 3. This is equivalent to\\ndividing every part of each of these inequalities by 3. And then we get negative 21\\ndivided by 3 is negative 7, is less than or equal\\nto x, which is less than or equal to 15\\ndivided by 3 is 5. You do it here. You get negative 7 is\\nless than or equal to x, and x is less than or\\nequal to 15/3, which is 5. This statement and this\\nstatement are completely equal. And we\\'ve solved for x. We\\'ve given you\\nthe solution set. And if we want to graph\\nit on a number line, it would look like this. This is 0. This is 5. This is negative 7. Our solution set includes\\neverything between negative 7 and 5, including\\nnegative 7 and 5. So we have to fill in\\nthe circles on negative 7 and positive 5. And it is everything in between. That\\'s our solution set. And so we can verify\\nthat these work. You could try out\\na number that\\'s well inside of our\\nsolution set, like 0. 3 times 0 is 0. So you\\'re just left\\nwith 5 is greater than or equal to negative\\n16, which is true. And 5 is less than\\nor equal to 20. Or negative 16 is less than or\\nequal to 5, which is less than or equal to 20. So that works, and\\nthat makes sense. You could try 5. If you put 5 here,\\nyou get 3 times 5 plus 5-- well, that\\'s just 20. Negative 16 is less than or\\nequal to 20, which is less than or equal to 20. That works. Negative 7 should also work. 3 times negative 7 is negative\\n21, plus 5 is negative 16. So you get negative\\n16, which is less than or equal to negative 16, which\\nis less than or equal to 20. And you could try other values. You could go outside\\nof our solution set. Try something like 10. 10 should not work. And you see here, if you put 10\\nhere, you get 3 times 10 plus 5 is 35. Negative 16 is less\\nthan or equal to 35, but 35 is not less\\nthan or equal to 20. And that\\'s why 10 is not\\npart of our solution set. ',\n",
       " '2.6.5': 'Let\\'s do some compound\\ninequality problems, and these are just inequality problems\\nthat have more than one set of constraints. You\\'re going to see what I\\'m\\ntalking about in a second. So the first problem I have is\\nnegative 5 is less than or equal to x minus 4, which is\\nalso less than or equal to 13. So we have two sets of\\nconstraints on the set of x\\'s that satisfy these equations. x minus 4 has to be greater than\\nor equal to negative 5 and x minus 4 has to be less\\nthan or equal to 13. So we could rewrite this\\ncompound inequality as negative 5 has to be less than\\nor equal to x minus 4, and x minus 4 needs to be less\\nthan or equal to 13. And then we could solve each of\\nthese separately, and then we have to remember this \"and\"\\nthere to think about the solution set because it has to\\nbe things that satisfy this equation and this equation. So let\\'s solve each of\\nthem individually. So this one over here,\\nwe can add 4 to both sides of the equation. The left-hand side, negative\\n5 plus 4, is negative 1. Negative 1 is less than\\nor equal to x, right? These 4\\'s just cancel out here\\nand you\\'re just left with an x on this right-hand side. So the left, this part right\\nhere, simplifies to x needs to be greater than or equal to\\nnegative 1 or negative 1 is less than or equal to x. So we can also write\\nit like this. X needs to be greater than\\nor equal to negative 1. These are equivalent. I just swapped the sides. Now let\\'s do this other\\ncondition here in green. Let\\'s add 4 to both sides\\nof this equation. The left-hand side,\\nwe just get an x. And then the right-hand\\nside, we get 13 plus 14, which is 17. So we get x is less than\\nor equal to 17. So our two conditions, x has to\\nbe greater than or equal to negative 1 and less than\\nor equal to 17. So we could write this\\nagain as a compound inequality if we want. We can say that the solution\\nset, that x has to be less than or equal to 17 and greater\\nthan or equal to negative 1. It has to satisfy both\\nof these conditions. So what would that look\\nlike on a number line? So let\\'s put our number\\nline right there. Let\\'s say that this is 17. Maybe that\\'s 18. You keep going down. Maybe this is 0. I\\'m obviously skipping a bunch\\nof stuff in between. Then we would have a negative\\n1 right there, maybe a negative 2. So x is greater than or equal\\nto negative 1, so we would start at negative 1. We\\'re going to circle it in\\nbecause we have a greater than or equal to. And then x is greater than that,\\nbut it has to be less than or equal to 17. So it could be equal to\\n17 or less than 17. So this right here is a solution\\nset, everything that I\\'ve shaded in orange. And if we wanted to write it in\\ninterval notation, it would be x is between negative 1 and\\n17, and it can also equal negative 1, so we put\\na bracket, and it can also equal 17. So this is the interval notation\\nfor this compound inequality right there. Let\\'s do another one. Let me get a good\\nproblem here. Let\\'s say that we have\\nnegative 12. I\\'m going to change the problem\\na little bit from the one that I\\'ve found here. Negative 12 is less than 2 minus\\n5x, which is less than or equal to 7. I want to do a problem that has\\njust the less than and a less than or equal to. The problem in the book that\\nI\\'m looking at has an equal sign here, but I want to remove\\nthat intentionally because I want to show you\\nwhen you have a hybrid situation, when you have\\na little bit of both. So first we can separate this\\ninto two normal inequalities. You have this inequality\\nright there. We know that negative 12 needs\\nto be less than 2 minus 5x. That has to be satisfied, and--\\nlet me do it in another color-- this inequality also\\nneeds to be satisfied. 2 minus 5x has to be less than\\n7 and greater than 12, less than or equal to 7 and greater\\nthan negative 12, so and 2 minus 5x has to be less\\nthan or equal to 7. So let\\'s just solve this the\\nway we solve everything. Let\\'s get this 2 onto the\\nleft-hand side here. So let\\'s subtract 2 from both\\nsides of this equation. So if you subtract 2 from both\\nsides of this equation, the left-hand side becomes negative\\n14, is less than-- these cancel out-- less\\nthan negative 5x. Now let\\'s divide both\\nsides by negative 5. And remember, when you multiply\\nor divide by a negative number, the inequality\\nswaps around. So if you divide both sides by\\nnegative 5, you get a negative 14 over negative 5, and you have\\nan x on the right-hand side, if you divide that by\\nnegative 5, and this swaps from a less than sign to\\na greater than sign. The negatives cancel out, so you\\nget 14/5 is greater than x, or x is less than 14/5,\\nwhich is-- what is this? This is 2 and 4/5. x is less than 2 and 4/5. I just wrote this improper\\nfraction as a mixed number. Now let\\'s do the other\\nconstraint over here in magenta. So let\\'s subtract 2 from both\\nsides of this equation, just like we did before. And actually, you can do these\\nsimultaneously, but it becomes kind of confusing. So to avoid careless mistakes, I\\nencourage you to separate it out like this. So if you subtract 2 from both\\nsides of the equation, the left-hand side becomes\\nnegative 5x. The right-hand side, you have\\nless than or equal to. The right-hand side becomes\\n7 minus 2, becomes 5. Now, you divide both sides\\nby negative 5. On the left-hand side,\\nyou get an x. On the right-hand side, 5\\ndivided by negative 5 is negative 1. And since we divided by a\\nnegative number, we swap the inequality. It goes from less than or\\nequal to, to greater than or equal to. So we have our two\\nconstraints. x has to be less than 2 and 4/5,\\nand it has to be greater than or equal to negative 1. So we could write\\nit like this. x has to be greater than or\\nequal to negative 1, so that would be the lower bound on our\\ninterval, and it has to be less than 2 and 4/5. And notice, not less\\nthan or equal to. That\\'s why I wanted to show you,\\nyou have the parentheses there because it can\\'t be\\nequal to 2 and 4/5. x has to be less\\nthan 2 and 4/5. Or we could write this way. x has to be less than 2 and\\n4/5, that\\'s just this inequality, swapping the\\nsides, and it has to be greater than or equal\\nto negative 1. So these two statements\\nare equivalent. And if I were to draw it\\non a number line, it would look like this. So you have a negative 1, you\\nhave 2 and 4/5 over here. Obviously, you\\'ll have\\nstuff in between. Maybe, you know, 0\\nsitting there. We have to be greater than or\\nequal to negative 1, so we can be equal to negative 1. And we\\'re going to be greater\\nthan negative 1, but we also have to be less than\\n2 and 4/5. So we can\\'t include\\n2 and 4/5 there. We can\\'t be equal to 2 and 4/5,\\nso we can only be less than, so we put a empty circle\\naround 2 and 4/5 and then we fill in everything below that,\\nall the way down to negative 1, and we include negative 1\\nbecause we have this less than or equal sign. So the last two problems I did\\nare kind of \"and\" problems. You have to meet both of\\nthese constraints. Now, let\\'s do an \"or\" problem. So let\\'s say I have these\\ninequalities. Let\\'s say I\\'m given-- let\\'s say\\nthat 4x minus 1 needs to be greater than or equal to\\n7, or 9x over 2 needs to be less than 3. So now when we\\'re saying \"or,\"\\nan x that would satisfy these are x\\'s that satisfy either\\nof these equations. In the last few videos or in the\\nlast few problems, we had to find x\\'s that satisfied\\nboth of these equations. Here, this is much\\nmore lenient. We just have to satisfy\\none of these two. So let\\'s figure out the solution\\nsets for both of these and then we figure out\\nessentially their union, their combination, all of\\nthe things that\\'ll satisfy either of these. So on this one, on the one\\non the left, we can add 1 to both sides. You add 1 to both sides. The left-hand side just becomes\\n4x is greater than or equal to 7 plus 1 is 8. Divide both sides by 4. You get x is greater\\nthan or equal to 2. Or let\\'s do this one. Let\\'s see, if we multiply both\\nsides of this equation by 2/9, what do we get? If you multiply both sides by\\n2/9, it\\'s a positive number, so we don\\'t have to do anything\\nto the inequality. These cancel out, and you get\\nx is less than 3 times 2/9. 3/9 is the same thing as\\n1/3, so x needs to be less than 2/3. So or x is less than 2/3. So that\\'s our solution set. x needs to be greater than or\\nequal to 2, or less than 2/3. So this is interesting. Let me plot the solution\\nset on the number line. So that is our number line. Maybe this is 0, this is 1, this\\nis 2, 3, maybe that is negative 1. So x can be greater than\\nor equal to 2. So we could start-- let me\\ndo it in another color. We can start at 2 here and it\\nwould be greater than or equal to 2, so include everything\\ngreater than or equal to 2. That\\'s that condition\\nright there. Or x could be less than 2/3. So 2/3 is going to be right\\naround here, right? That is 2/3. x could be less than 2/3. And this is interesting. Because if we pick one of these\\nnumbers, it\\'s going to satisfy this inequality. If we pick one of these numbers,\\nit\\'s going to satisfy that inequality. If we had an \"and\" here, there\\nwould have been no numbers that satisfy it because you\\ncan\\'t be both greater than 2 and less than 2/3. So the only way that there\\'s\\nany solution set here is because it\\'s \"or.\" You can\\nsatisfy one of the two inequalities. Anyway, hopefully you,\\nfound that fun. ',\n",
       " '3.1.1': 'Voiceover:We\\'ve seen\\nmultiple times in our life that distance can be\\nviewed as rate times time. What I want to do in this video is use this fairly simple\\nformula right over here, this fairly simple equation, to understand that units\\ncan really be viewed as algebraic objects, that you can treat them like variables as we work through a\\nformula or an equation, which could be really, really helpful to make sure that we\\'re\\ngetting the results in units that actually make sense. For example, if someone\\nwere to give you a rate, if they were to say a rate of, let\\'s say, 5 meters per second, and they were to give you a time, a time of 10 seconds, then we can pretty, in a\\npretty straightforward way, apply this formula. We say, well, distance\\nis equal to our rate, 5 meters per second times our time, times our time, which is 10 seconds. What\\'s neat here is we\\ncan treat the units, as I\\'ve just said, like\\nalgebraic constructs, kind of like variables, so this would be equal to, well, multiplication, it doesn\\'t matter what order we multiply in, so we can change the order. This is the same thing as 5 times 10, 5 times 10 times meters per second, times meters per second times seconds, times seconds. If we were to treat our units as these algebraic objects, we could say, hey, look, we have seconds divided by seconds, or you\\'re going to have\\nseconds in the denominator multiplied by seconds in the numerator. Those are going to cancel out, and 5 times 10, of course, is, 5 times 10, of course, is 50. We would be left with 50, and the units that we\\'re\\nleft with are the meters, 50 meters. That\\'s pretty neat. The units worked out. When we treated the units\\nout like algebraic objects, they worked out so that\\nour end units for distance were in meters, which\\nis a unit of distance. Now you\\'re saying, \"OK,\\nthat\\'s cute and everything, \"but this seems like a little\\nbit of too much overhead \"to worry about when I\\'m just doing \"a simple formula like this.\" But what I want to show you is that even with a simple formula like distance is equal to rate times time, what I just did could\\nactually be quite useful, and this thing that I\\'m\\ndoing is actually called dimensional analysis. It\\'s useful for something as simple as distance equals rate times time, but as you go into physics\\nand chemistry and engineering, you\\'ll see much, much, much more, I would say, hairy formulas. When you do the dimensional analysis, it makes sure that the\\nmath is working out right. It makes sure that you\\'re\\ngetting the right units. But even with this, let\\'s try a slightly\\nmore complicated example. Let\\'s say that our rate is, let\\'s say, let\\'s keep our\\nrate at 5 meters per second, but let\\'s say that\\nsomeone gave us the time. Instead of giving it in\\nseconds, they give it in hours, so they say the time is equal to 1 hour. Now let\\'s try to apply this formula. We\\'re going to get distance is\\nequal to 5 meters per second, 5 meters per second times\\ntime, which is 1 hour, times 1 hour. What\\'s that going to give us? The 5 times the 1, so we multiply the 5 times the 1, that\\'s just going to give us 5. But then remember, we have to treat the units algebraically. We\\'re going to do our\\ndimensional analysis, so it\\'s 5, so we have meters per second times hours, times hours, or you could say 5 meter hours per second. Well, this doesn\\'t look like a ... This isn\\'t a set of units that we know that makes sense to us. This doesn\\'t feel like our\\ntraditional units of distance, so we want to cancel this out in some way. It might jump out of you, well, if we can get rid of this hours, if we can express it in terms of seconds, then that would cancel here, and we\\'d be left with just the meters, which is a unit of distance\\nthat we\\'re familiar with. So how do we do that? We\\'d want to multiply this thing by something that has\\nhours in the denominator and seconds in the numerator, times essentially seconds per hour. How many seconds are there per hour? Well, there are 3,600 ... Let me do this in a ... I\\'ll do it in this color. There are 3,600 seconds per hour, or you could even say that there are 3,600 seconds for every 1 hour. Now when you multiply, these hours will cancel with these hours, these seconds will cancel\\nwith those seconds, and we are left with, we are left with 5 times 3,600. What is that? That\\'s 5 times 3,000 would be 15,000, 5 times 600 is another 3,000, so that is equal to 18,000. The only units that we\\'re left with, we just have the meters there. 18- Oh, it\\'s 18,000, 18,000, 18,000 meters. We\\'re done. We\\'ve now expressed our distance in terms of units that we recognize. If you go 5 meters per second for 1 hour, you will go 18,000 meters. But let\\'s just use our little dimensional analysis\\nmuscles a little bit more. What if we didn\\'t want\\nthe answer in meters but we wanted the answer in kilometers? What could we do? Well, we could take that 18,000 meters, 18,000 meters, and if we could multiply it by something that has meters in the denominator, meters in the denominator and kilometers in the numerator, then these meters would cancel out, and we\\'d be left with the kilometers. So what can we multiply it so we\\'re not really changing the value? We want to multiply it by essentially 1, so we want to write equivalent things in the numerator and the denominator. So 1 kilometer is equivalent to, equivalent to 1,000 meters. One way to think about it, we\\'re just multiplying this thing by 1, 1 kilometer over 1,000 meters. Well, 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, so this thing is equivalent to 1. But what\\'s neat is when you multiply, we have meters canceling with meters, and so you\\'re left with\\n18,000 divided by 1,000 is equal to 18. And then the only units we\\'re left with is the kilometers, and we are done. We have re-expressed our distance instead of in meters in terms of kilometers. ',\n",
       " '3.1.2': \"So I have a car here, and\\nlet's say that in 3 hours, this car is able to\\ntravel 150 kilometers. So what I want to think\\nabout in this video is, what are some reasonable\\nways to express the rate at which this car\\ntraveled for those 3 hours? And I encourage you\\nto pause this video and think about it for yourself. One, you could\\ncalculate the rate. But also think about\\ndifferent units that you could use\\nto express that rate, and which ones would\\nbe useful-- which ones what would be\\nreasonable, and which ones would be unreasonable. So let's just remind\\nourselves what rate even is. So you could think\\nabout distance as being equal to\\nrate times time. Or you could imagine if you\\ndivide both sides by time, you could imagine that\\ndistance divided by time is equal to rate. So they've given us a distance,\\nthey've given us a time. So we could just divide the\\ndistance divided by the time to figure out the rates. And I'm going to\\nkeep the units here. Because it's really important\\nto recognize that the units, to some degree, they can also\\nbe manipulated algebraically. Now they aren't variables, but\\nthey follow the same rules, I guess I should say,\\nas a variable would. So for example, if\\nI said, look rate is distance divided by time. So I could say that my\\nrate in this situation is going to be 150 kilometers\\ndivided by 3 hours. So if we just look at\\nthe numeric part of this, what's 150 divided by 3? Well that's going to be 50. So this is going\\nto be equal to 50. But we can keep\\nthe units the way that they are, right over here. This is 50 kilometers per hour. This is what I meant\\nby saying look, we're dividing this quantity,\\nexpressed in kilometers, by this quantity,\\nexpressed in hours. We can divide the numeric\\npart, 150 divided by 3. But then we could leave at\\nthe units in that relationship that they were before. So you can kind of algebraically\\nkeep them that way. And you'll see in a\\nsecond we're going to manipulate them\\na lot more, using what's often called the\\ndimensional analysis. But anyway, this is a reasonable\\nway to express a rate. 50 kilometers per hour. I can imagine this. I can imagine that\\nin 1 hour, you're going to go 50 kilometers. Let's think about other ways\\nthat we could represent that. So 50 kilometers\\nper hour-- and this is where we're really going to\\ndo some dimensional analysis with our units. So 50 kilometers per hour. Let's say we want to\\nexpress it in terms of kilometers per second. So how could we write\\n50 kilometers per hour, in terms of\\nkilometers per second? Well it's always good, actually,\\nas a first approximation, to just think about it. If you went this far in an hour,\\nthen the number of kilometers you go in a second, is that\\ngoing to be less, or more? Well a second's a much,\\nmuch shorter period of time. There's 3,600\\nseconds in an hour. So you're going to go\\n1/3,600 of this distance. But let's think about\\nhow we would actually work out with the units. Well, we want to get rid of\\nthis hours in the denominator. And the plural,\\nobviously the grammar doesn't hold up\\nwith the algebra, but this could be hour or hours. So we could think\\nabout well, 1 hour-- I'll write an hour in\\nthe numerator that's going to cancel with this\\nhour in the denominator. But we want it in\\nterms of seconds. So 1 hour is equal\\nto how many seconds? Well 1 hour is equal\\nto 3,600 seconds. This is what I meant\\nby saying that using dimensional analysis, which\\nis what I'm doing right now, we can essentially\\nmanipulate these units, as we would traditionally\\ndo with a variable. So we have hours\\ndivided by hours. And so when we do\\nthe multiplication, we can multiply\\nthe numeric parts. So we have 50 times\\n1, divided by 3,600. Let me write that. 50 times 1 over 3,600. And then our units left\\nare kilometers per second. Or I could say seconds. So we can play around with\\nthe plural and singular parts of it, but I'll just write\\nit as kilometers per second. And so this is 50/3,600. And this fits our intuition. In a second, you're going to go\\n1/3,600 as far as you would go in an hour. But let's actually think\\nabout what this is equal to. 50/3,600-- so this is\\ngoing to be the same thing, as-- Let me just\\nsimplify it over here. So 50/3,600 is the\\nsame thing as 5/360, which is the same thing as-- let\\nme write it this way-- 10/720. And I did that way because\\nthat makes it clear that that's the\\nsame thing as 1/72. So you could write\\nthis as, you're going, this is equal to 1/72 of\\na kilometer per second. Now I would claim\\nthat this is not so reasonable of units for\\nthis example right over here. 1/72 of a kilometer\\nevery second? That doesn't help me too much. I guess I'll know\\nthat in 72 seconds I will have gone a kilometer. But this is something that's\\nkind of strange for me to conceptualize. If I wanted to get\\nmy calculator out, 1/72, 1 divided by\\n72-- if someone said, hey, I'm going 0.0139\\nkilometers in a second, that doesn't seem to make a\\nlot of conceptual sense to me. So I would say that\\nthis, right over here, is a very reasonable\\nway to express our rate. This one seems like more\\nof an unreasonable way. But we could salvage this. Because we're going 1/72\\nof a kilometer per second. Now this is a small\\nnumber, but how could we make it much larger? Well, what if we\\nthought in terms of, not kilometers per\\nsecond, but if we thought in terms of\\nmeters per second. A kilometer's 1,000 meters. So if we think about this in\\nterms of meters per second, we're going to get a\\nlarger number here, in fact larger by\\na factor of 1,000. So let's think about that. Let's try to convert this\\nkilometers to meters. So how would we do that? Well, once again, if\\nwe have kilometers in the denominator\\nthis kilometer will cancel with that kilometer. And we want a meter\\nin the numerator. So we want to think about\\nhow many meters are there per kilometer. Well there's 1,000\\nmeters per kilometer. Kilometers cancel out, and we\\nare left with 1,000 times 1-- I'll just write that\\nas 1,000-- over 72. And now we're left\\nwith in the numerator, we're left with the\\nunit meters per second. And I know I keep writing\\nsecond in different ways. Oftentimes actually you'll see\\npeople write second like that. So actually let me\\njust go with that. So s is second, is seconds,\\nis sec, just like that. So is this fairly reasonable? Well actually, this\\nfeels pretty good. Let's get our calculator out\\nand figure out what that is. So 1,000 divided by 72\\ngives us 13, if I round, that's about 13.9. So this is approximately equal\\nto 13.9 meters per second. Which I can visualize. I can imagine how\\nfar 13.9 meters is, and of doing that\\ndistance in one second. So this actually also\\nseems like a reasonable way to express the rate. So I could say hey, this thing's\\ngoing 50 kilometers per hour. I can imagine it going roughly\\n13.9 meters per second. So this is reasonable as well. But to say it's going 1/72\\nof a kilometer per second doesn't really\\nseem to make sense. And also, if I try to think\\nabout it in terms of meters per hour, that also\\nwould be strange. Actually, I encourage\\nyou to calculate it. Try to convert this right\\nover here to meters per hour. Then we would say well, we\\ncould use the same thing here. That's going to be 1,000\\nmeters for every 1 kilometer. Kilometers cancel out. And I'm going to be\\nleft with 50 times 1,000 is 50,000 meters per hour. So I have trouble\\nimagining-- well, obviously if I convert\\nto kilometers in my head I could imagine it-- but this\\nis kind of a crazy large number. 50,000 meters per hour. So at least in my eyes,\\nusing kilometers per hour to describe this\\nrate seems useful. Describing this rate as meters\\nper second seems useful. But describing it as kilometers\\nper second, or meters per hour, seem a little bit unusual. \",\n",
       " '3.2.1': \"- [Instructor] So I have data here on two different websites, website A and website B. And my question to you is, which one is more productive? And some of you might be asking yourself, what does it mean to be productive? And at a very high level, you could view productivity\\nas how effective something is at producing. So for a given amount of input into the process, how much output are you getting? If you want to get a\\nlittle bit more exact, you could view it as the\\nrate of output per input. But that still makes us ask the question, what are the inputs and\\nwhat are the outputs? So pause this video and think about how you would measure productivity for or how you would compare the productivity of these two websites. And there's multiple ways to do it. All right, now let's\\nthink through it together. What I'm first going to do is look at each of these lines and think about whether they are\\nan input or an output. So the number of writers, well, you need the writers to produce the website. So I would consider that an input. Although if you were the head of HR, the person who is hiring writers, the head of human resources, and you were hiring writers, then that could actually be an output. But if we're just thinking about creating a website, we need writers to create\\nit so that's an input. Number of posts posted, average number of words of post, average likes of post, average comments of post, number of new subscribers, those all feel like outputs. If the writers do a good job, they're going to produce a lot of posts, they're going to, I guess,\\nhave a lot of words, I don't know if it's good to always be wordy. People will like their posts, they'll comment on those posts. We'll have new subscribers. So this is all output. What about revenue? That's how much money a site brings in before having to pay its expenses. So that also should be an output because if the writers do a good job, if the site is well run, they will generate a lot of revenue. What about expenses? Well, you need to use expenses. You need to spend expenses on\\nthings like writer salaries in order to create your website, in order to generate that revenue. So I would consider that an input. And what about profit? Profit is all the money you bring in minus your expenses and\\nhow much you get leftover. Well, some people would argue the\\nwhole point of a business is to generate that profit. That is an outcome you want\\nto maximize, an output. And so I would consider that an output. And so the question of\\nproductivity really just boils down to which output or what combinations of output do we want\\nto figure out the rate that we're generating\\nrelative to some input or some combination of inputs? So a really simple way\\nof measuring productivity in this situation, let's define it, productivity. And once again, there's multiple ways of defining it. Let's say it is equal to the profit per number of writers. So it could be profit over\\nthe number of writers. If we define it that way, which website is more productive? Well, website A, in that definition, A would have a productivity of $10,000 for five writers. So it would be $2,000 profit per writer. And what would be B's per\\nactivity by this definition? Well, $28,000 divided by 11, 28,000 divided by 11 writers, there's $28,000 in profit. That gives us a 2,000, and we'll round, 2,545. So approximately $2,545\\nof profit per writer. So based on this\\nmeasurement of productivity, it looks like website B is more productive. Now what if we did maybe\\neven a simpler one, or maybe one that you might think is even more natural? What if we thought about it as the number of posts per writer? So let's do it that way. So if we just defined productivity, I'll just do that, as being equal to the number of posts divided by the writers. Well, in this situation, website A would have a productivity of 110 divided by five, which would be 22, 22 posts per writer, and website B 200 divided by 11 , 200 divided by 11 gets us, well, we could just\\nround that to maybe 18, since we want to get rough estimates, to 18 posts per writer. So by this measure of productivity, website A actually looks more productive. So hopefully this gives\\nyou just a general sense of what productivity is, and an appreciation that\\nthere's multiple ways of measuring it. And you could do much fancier things, you could say, you could make it a whole combination of outputs divided by a\\ncombination of inputs. So you could define\\nproductivity as the number of posts posted times the\\naverage number of posts, you take that quantity, and then maybe add the\\naverage likes per post or multiply by the average likes per post, and then add to that the comments per post or multiply by the comments per post and then divide by the number of writers or the number of writers and expenses or divide just by the expenses. But the general notion is you\\nwanna take some combination of the outputs, maybe even just one\\noutput and divide it by some combination of the inputs\\nand you can actually decide how you even wanna combine, how you wanna mathematically combine those outputs and inputs. \",\n",
       " '3.2.2': '- [Instructor] We\\'re told that Marvin has an inflatable wading\\npool in his back yard. The pool is cylindrical with a base area of four square meters and\\na height of 60 centimeters. What is the volume of\\nthe pool in cubic meters? Pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. All right, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. And let\\'s just first visualize what this cylindrical\\nwading pool would look like. It would look something like this. A wading pool\\'s kind of a small pool where you can just hang out a bit in it. You\\'re not necessarily gonna\\nswim around too much in it. So it might look something like this. I know I\\'m not drawing it perfectly. It\\'s kind of a hand-drawn situation, and I\\'m making it transparent\\nso that we can see the base. So the wading pool would\\nlook something like that. They tell us that we have a\\nbase area of four square meters. So this area right over\\nhere, that\\'s the base. That is four square meters. And it has a height of 60 centimeters, tell us that right over there. So this height is 60 centimeters. So the volume, our\\nreaction might be to say, \"Okay, the volume of a cylinder\\nis the area of the base times the height.\" And so in this case, why wouldn\\'t we just take four times 60, times 60, and we would\\nget a volume of 240. And we want it in cubic meters, so we just say 240 cubic meters. Is this true? Did I just do this correctly? Well, some of you might have realized that what I just multiplied, I didn\\'t multiply four square meters times 60 meters to get 240 cubic meters. I just multiplied four square meters times 60, 60 centimeters. And if you multiply these two things, your actual units would\\nnot be cubic meters. You would end up of units of\\nmeters squared centimeters, which is not what they want and that is kind of a\\nbizarre set of units. So in order to get the\\nanswer in cubic meters, we would wanna re-express 60\\ncentimeters in terms of meters. Well, how many meters is 60 centimeters? Well, 100 centimeters make a meter. So I could write it this way. So 100 centimeters equal one meter. Or another way you could think about it is one centimeter is equal\\nto 1/100 of a meter. And so 60 centimeters is going to be equal to 60/100 of a meter. So now we can apply this, \\'cause we\\'re dealing with\\nmeters consistently now. So we can say, so this is actually wrong. We could say the volume\\nis going to be equal to the base in square meters, and I\\'m gonna write the units down and make sure we\\'re doing the right thing, times the height, times\\n60 over 100 meters. And now everything works out. Four times 60 over 100 is\\ngoing to be 240 over 100. And then meters squared times meter, we are left with cubic meters, which is exactly what they asked us for. And of course, we could rewrite\\nthis as 2.4 cubic meters. And we are done. ',\n",
       " '3.2.3': \"- [Instructor] We're told\\nthat Hannah and Martine each got a plant for their home. Hannah measured that her plant grows, on average, 2 centimeters per week. Martine measured that her plant grows, on average, 3 millimeters per day. Which plant grows faster? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out on your own. All right, now let's go\\nthrough this together. So at first when you look at it, you might just compare 3 to 2 and say, oh, 3 is larger than 2, therefore maybe Martine's\\nplant grows faster. And you would think that\\nuntil you look at the units. This is millimeters per day while for Hannah's plant it's in centimeters per week. So in order to really compare them we have to convert them to the same units in both length and time. So let's convert both of them, let's convert them both\\nto centimeters per week. You could just try to convert both of them to millimeters per day or I guess you could try\\nto convert both of them to meters per year, a third set of units, but centimeters per week seems reasonable since we already have\\nHannah's plant rate at, so let me write this down. So Hannah, I'll just write H, grows at 2 centimeters per week. And then you have Martine, grows at an average of\\n3 millimeters per day. Now how do we convert\\n3 millimeters per day to centimeters per week? Well, first we could\\nconvert the millimeters, actually, first, let's\\nconvert the days into weeks. So how many days are there in a week? Well, there's 7 days in a week. So if we have how many\\nmillimeters per day, if we wanted to know millimeters per week we would multiply times 7 days. So let me do that. So times 7 days in a week. That would get us, this would be equal to 3 times 7 which is equal to 21 millimeters in a week. And you can see, actually, that the units cancel\\nout nicely like that, so you're left with millimeters a week. And that makes sense, 3 millimeters a day, you're able to do 7 times that in a week, 21 millimeters a week. And then when you think\\nabout 21 millimeters is how many centimeters? Well, we just have to remember that 1 centimeter is\\nequal to 10 millimeters, so if we wanna covert\\nthis into centimeters, we essentially have to divide by 10. We could just say 1/10 of\\na centimeter per millimeter and then that gets us, we could write it in different ways, but we could write this, and even here the units cancel out nicely, 21 divided by 10 is 2.1\\ncentimeters per week. Another way you could\\nhave just thought about it is we could say 1 centimeter\\nis equal to 10 millimeters, or if you divide both sides by 10, 1/10 of a centimeter is\\nequal to 1 millimeter, and if 1 millimeter is equal\\nto 1/10 of a centimeter then 21 millimeters is just\\ngoing to be 21 times this, 21 times 1/10 is the same\\nthing as 21 divided by 10, it would be 2.1 centimeters. And so now we can compare\\n2.1 centimeters per week compared to 2 centimeters a week. Well, it turns out that when you actually compare\\nthe appropriate units it still turns out that Martine's plant is growing just a little bit faster. \",\n",
       " '3.2.4': \"- In this video, we're going to talk a little\\nbit about measurement. and the idea that you really can't measure exactly the dimensions of something. And I know what you' re thinking, You' re like, well, no, of course, we can measure the\\ndimensions of something. Let's say I have some type of a gear over here. So let me draw my gear, and if I were to ask you, that's\\nnot the best drawing gear, but if I were to ask you, what's the inner diameter\\nof the hole of the gear, right over here? Maybe you take a ruler\\nout, right over here. So this is my ruler. And that you are able to\\nsee when you measure it, that it is one centimeter in diameter. But then I say, is it\\nexactly one centimeter? And then you realize, well, yeah, let me get a\\nlittle bit more precise. Maybe you get a magnifying glass out here. So this is the lens of\\nmy magnifying glass. And you zoom in a little bit. Maybe you get a better ruler that marks off the millimeters and you actually say, Oh, well, when I look a little bit closer, it actually turns out it's\\nnot exactly one centimeter. It's actually closer to 1.1 centimeters. And then I ask you, is that exactly the inner\\ndiameter of this gear here? And like, okay, well let\\nme get out of microscope. And then you realize, Oh, you' re right, it's\\nactually 1.089 centimeters. And then I ask you, is that exactly right? And then you' re like,\\nyeah, I guess you' re right. I haven't measured to the nearest, to the height or the width of an atom, to do that I would need\\na lot more precision right over here. And so maybe I need some type\\nof an electron microscope, but even if you're able to do that, and that would be many decimal places to the right of the decimal point here, if you're measuring in centimeters, you can still ask, was\\nis that exactly right? Maybe you can measure the parts of an atom or to a measurement even\\nsmaller than an atom And if later on, you might\\nstudy quantum physics and there are some levels of granularity where you can't get a true\\nmeasurement below that, but as you can see, it\\nis somewhat arbitrary for our everyday life. And so the question is,\\nwhich one do you pick? Or how much trouble do you get? Or how much trouble do you take to get to these different\\nlevels of precision? And the answer is, it just depends. If the goal was, hey, we just\\nwanna make multiple copies of maybe jewelry of this little car gear, so we're gonna wanna put, some type of, I don't know, gold chain through it. And we say, hey, we need\\nat least three quarters of a centimeter in order to get the rope or the chain through it. Well then this first measurement,\\nthat's enough precision. But if I told you this gear is going to be an essential\\npart of the space shuttle, or some type of really\\nimportant machinery, that has really fine tolerances, I guess people aren't\\nusing the spacial anymore, but some finally engineered automobile or something that's going\\nto have a lot of needs, really close tolerances it needs to be really, really precise. Well then even this 1.089\\ncentimeters might not be enough. You might have to get to something like it's 1.089203 centimeters, to be able to be really,\\nreally finely crafted. We're nowhere close\\nwith our everyday tools to get anywhere close to say the width or the height of an atom and you could even theory\\nmeasure within the atom. And so you just have to think about what the measurement is for. I'll give another example, this right over here is a\\npicture of Mount Everest. You might know it as the\\ntallest mountain in the world. And if you were to ask someone,\\nhow tall is Mount Everest? If you were to do a web\\nsearch for it right now, you would find that it\\nis 8,848 meters tall. Now, this is clearly\\nrounded to the nearest meter because if you were to go\\nto the top of Mount Everest, you'll see little pebbles. In fact, those pebbles might move around. And so the actual precise\\nheight of Mount Everest might change actually second by second, depending if rain is\\nfalling, snow is falling, how the wind is moving\\ndifferent pebbles around, but for most of our daily\\npurposes, this is sufficient. In fact, for a lot of us, we might not even need\\nthis level of precision. We might say, hey, it's roughly or it's approximately, we'd estimate that it's about 9,000 meters. But there are applications where you would need at least\\nthis level of precision, or maybe something even more precise. For example, if you wanted to compare it to another mountain, say K2, which is the second tallest\\nmountain in the world. And let's say they are close in height, and actually, if you were\\nto do a Google search, you would see that K2, has\\na height of 8,611 meters rounded to the nearest meter. You'd see that, that\\n9,000 meter approximation. It wouldn't be enough if you're round to the\\nnearest kilometer, I guess, that wouldn't be enough to be able to compare Mount Everest to K2, because rounded to the nearest kilometer, they're both approximately\\nnine kilometers. So this is approximately\\n9,000 meters as well. So you would need more precision. If you wanted to answer\\nwhich one is taller, you'd have to get at least\\nto the closest hundred meter. And then there's reasons why you might wanna get even more precise. Maybe you wanna create a\\nslide from the top of K2 to the bottom of K2. And so you can imagine\\nif your slide is too long by, let's say three meters, what's going to be hard to\\nget on that slide on the top, or it's going to dig into\\nthe snow at the bottom. And if your slide is too\\nshort by three meters, that's a pretty unpleasant\\nthing to have you go on this seemingly super fun slide, you have to drop nine feet at the end, or really if you' re off, what if you're off by 10 meters and you're gonna drop 30 feet off the end, which could really break some bones and be unpleasant. So the big takeaway is, it's very hard to measure\\nanything perfectly precisely. And you have to think about, what's the application? What are you trying to answer? What are you trying to\\njudge about those things? To determine how much precision you need in your measurement. \",\n",
       " '3.3.1': \"- [Narrator] We're told\\na factory makes toys that are sold for $10 apiece. The factory has 40 workers, and they each produce 25 toys a day. The factory is open five days a week. What is the total value of toys the factory produces in a day? Pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. All right, so let's\\njust think about a day, before I even look at this information. If I could figure out the value per toy, and then multiply that\\ntimes the number of toys, number of toys produced in a day, then we would have the total value. And let's see if they\\ngive us that information. Well the value per toy,\\nthey say the toys are sold for $10 apiece, so we\\ncould write this this way. 10 dollars per toy, and then they do tell us, or they give us the information\\nthat we need to figure out how many are produced in a day. We have 40 workers, and they\\neach produce 25 toys a day. So the amount that's produced in a day, is going to be 40 workers times 25 toys per worker. Now I could say 25 toys\\nper worker per day, and that makes the units\\na little complicated, or I could just realize\\nthat this entire expression I'm creating is talking about one day. So the total number of\\ntoys produced in a day is going to be the\\nproduct of these things. And we can say that the units work out, just to make sure that we're\\ngetting in the right direction. A toy in the denominator cancels out with the toys in the numerator, workers, when you multiply it, this\\nwould be in the numerator, this in the denominator. So workers, workers cancel out. And so I'm gonna be left with\\n10 times 40 times 25 dollars. And I do want it written in dollars. And so this is going to be\\nequal to 10 times 40 is 400, and then 400 times 25, let's\\nsee, that's going to be 4 times 25 times 100 so\\nthat's 100 times 100, which is 10,000, and then the units we're left with is dollars. And now you might be\\nsaying, wait, we didn't use all of the information and\\nthat's true, we didn't use the fact that the factory\\nis open 5 days a week. We didn't need to use that information. That would have been useful if they said, what is the total value of toys the factory produces in a week. Then we would have said their\\nvalue per day is $10,000, and we could even write\\nit this way, per day, and then multiply that\\ntimes 5 days in a week, and that would have\\ngiven us the total value of the production in a week. But that's not what they're asking for, so we don't need that other information, and so we don't have to go to that step. And so this is really\\njust extra information, probably to distract you a bit. \",\n",
       " '3.3.2': \"- [Instructor] We're told that\\nRicky is going on a road trip that is 100 kilometers long. His average speed is\\n70 kilometers per hour. At that speed, he can\\ndrive five kilometers for every liter of fuel that he uses. Fuel costs .60 dollars per liter. So the equivalent of 60 cents per liter, but they wrote it as\\n.60 dollars per liter. What is the cost of fuel for the trip? Pause the video and see if\\nyou can figure that out. All right, so let's see what\\ninformation they gave us. They tell us that the trip\\nis 100 kilometers long. They tell us that the average speed is 70 kilometers per hour. So 70 kilometers per hour. They tell us that at that speed, he can drive five kilometers for every liter of fuel that he uses. So five kilometers per liter. And then they tell us that fuel costs 0.60 dollars per liter. So then this last piece of\\ninformation right over here is that fuel costs 0.60 dollars per liter. Normally we would see that\\nwritten as 60 cents per liter, but let's just go with it this way. So what's going to be\\nuseful for the total cost of the fuel for the trip? Well, we need to figure out how much fuel we're going to use, and then multiply that,\\ntimes the cost of the fuel. So how much fuel are we going to be using? Let's see, we're going 100 kilometers, that's the total distance. And then this tells us,\\nessentially how many liters we're going to have to use\\nover those 100 kilometers. Now you might say, how\\nexactly does that work? Well if I'm going five\\nkilometers per liter, if I were to take the\\nreciprocal of this information, I would get one fifth of a liter, of a liter, per kilometer. That's how much fuel I use per kilometer. One fifth of a liter. And so why is that useful? Well if I take 100 kilometers, and if I were to multiply, times 1/5th of a liter per kilometer, this is going to tell you that over the course of this trip, I am going to use 100 times 1/5th liters. Or this is going to tell us that over the course of the trip, we're are going to use 20 liters. And then if we were to multiply that, times the cost of fuel per liter, well then we know how much\\nthe cost of our trip is. So let's do that. Then let's multiply this, times 0.60 dollars per liter, which is the same thing\\nas multiplying this, times 0.60 dollars per liter. The liters cancel out, so it's good that our units work out. We're left with just dollars here. So 20 times 0.60 is going to get us to 12. So we are left with 12 dollars. And we're done, that's\\nthe cost of our trip. And I know what you're thinking. Wait, we didn't use the\\ninformation right over here, that he's traveling an average speed of 70 kilometers per hour. It's true, we did not use\\nit in our calculation. Although it was kind of\\nuseful because we had to know what his fuel efficiency\\nis, at that speed. So they're saying, they're traveling at 70 kilometers per hour, then at that speed, we\\nget this fuel efficiency. Now they could have just told us, they didn't even have to tell us this, they could have just told us, at whatever speed he's going, his fuel efficiency is this. And we still would have\\nbeen able to figure out the total cost of the fuel for the trip. \",\n",
       " '3.3.3': \"I just received this drug\\ncalculation problem from a nursing student, and I think\\nit's essential that the nursing students out there are able to\\ndo this, just in case I'm the patient receiving the drug. So let's do it. And I think it's an interesting\\nunit conversion problem for pretty much anyone who wants\\npractice with unit conversion. So the question is that\\nwe have a doctor. The doctor orders drug x. And this is the dosage that\\nthe doctor's requesting. They're saying 5 milligrams per\\npound of patient weight-- I'll just write per pound of patient\\nweight-- every 12 hours. This is what we're\\nsupposed to do. But our supply of the drug--\\nit isn't just, you know, not just nuggets and milligrams. It's a solution. There's a certain amount of\\ngrams for every milliliter that we have of the solution. It's dissolved in some water. So this is our\\nsupply of drug x. We have 0.9-- I'll\\nwrite a 0 in front. My wife, who is a doctor, says\\nit's essential to write the 0 in front of the decimal. We have 0.9 grams per\\nmilliliter of solution. So if I were to take 1\\nmilliliter out of my solution and give it to someone, I'm\\nessentially giving them 0.9 grams of this drug. And the final piece of\\ninformation we're given is that the patient-- they weigh-- and\\nmaybe we should say they mass, because kilograms is mass,\\nbut we get the idea. The patient is 72.7 kilograms. So there's a couple\\ninteresting things here. We have to figure out the\\ndosage in terms of milliliters. We have to-- oh, actually,\\nI didn't even tell you the question. The question is, how many\\nmilliliters of solution do we have to give to\\nthe patient per dose? So milliliters of\\nsolution per dose. That's our question. And there's a couple of things. We have to go from\\nmilligrams to grams. And then convert that\\nto milliliters. And then they tell us per\\npound, but then they gave us the patient's weight, or\\ntheir mass, in kilograms. So we have to do some\\nconversion there. So I definitely can appreciate\\nhow this can be a little daunting and maybe\\nconfusing at times. So let's just do\\nit step by step. So the first interesting\\nthing-- and this is just something that you might need\\nto know, or you might have written down on paper, or you\\nmight have a calculator that does this-- is just how to\\nconvert kilograms to pounds. And it's good to know in\\ngeneral, if you're converting between the metric and\\nthe English systems. So 1 kilogram is approximately\\nequal to 2.2 pounds. Not exactly, but that's a\\npretty good approximation. And 1 pound-- if you just take\\n1 over that-- 1 pound is approximately equal\\nto 0.45 kilograms. So we'll just put\\nthis in a box. This is the only kind of\\noutside conversion information we'll need to do this problem. Everything else, we'll just\\nneed a calculator, unless we just want to spend a lot of\\ntime doing some arithmetic. So the first thing. Let's figure out our dosage\\nin terms of per kilogram. This is per pound, and\\nwe really don't need to know every 12 hours. Because they're saying, how\\nmany milliliters of solution do we do per dose? A dose is every 12 hours. So we just really, you know--\\nthe every 12 hours is kind of extra information. So we want to figure out this\\n5 milligrams per pound. How do we convert that to how\\nmany milligrams per kilogram? So let's do 5-- I'll write\\nit down here in magenta-- 5 milligrams per pound. And then we want to convert\\nthis to per kilogram. So we can multiply this times\\nthe number of pounds per kilogram-- I'll do it\\nin yellow-- times this information up here. Times 2.2 pounds per kilogram. And if you ever get confused--\\nyou know, gee, how did Sal know to multiply by 2.2 instead\\nof dividing by 2.2? Which is the same thing\\nas multiplying by 0.5. You can pay very close\\nattention to the units. Notice, I wrote 2.2\\npounds per kilogram. 2.2 pounds per 1 kilogram. And you know this'll work out,\\nbecause you have a pound in the numerator and you have\\na pound in the denominator. It's called\\ndimensional analysis. If you ever get confused with\\nthese things-- and I think, once you do enough practice,\\nyou'll find that you won't have to pay too much\\nattention to this. But at first, when you're\\ngetting started, just to make sure you're not multiplying\\nor dividing by the wrong thing, just make sure the\\ndimensions cancel out. Pounds in the numerator,\\npounds in the denominator. So let's do that. Pounds in the numerator, pounds\\nin the denominator cancel out. And you multiply 5 times 2.2. This is equal to-- let's see. 5 times 2 is 10. 5 times 0.2 is 1. So this is equal to 11. And then in our numerator,\\nwe have milligrams. 11 milligrams per kilogram. So we just converted our\\ndosage information to a pure metric system. It was actually a mix\\nbetween the metric and the English system before. Now let's see what we can do. Well, let's see if we can get\\nit in terms of how many milliliters we have to\\ndeliver per pound. So once again, we want this--\\nwell, actually, let's go to grams first. Because we have\\nmilligrams here. We have grams up here. So let's see if we can\\nconvert this thing to grams. So just like we did before,\\nwe want a milligrams in the denominator. I'll do it in orange. We want a milligrams in the\\ndenominator and we want a gram in the numerator. Why did I say that? Because I want this\\nand this to cancel. And I want a grams\\nin the numerator. So how many grams are\\nthere per milligram? You can just think it through. There's 1 gram per\\n1,000 milligrams. Or 1,000 milligrams per gram. And you just multiply it out. So the milligrams cancels with\\nthe milligrams, and then we get-- this is equal to\\n11/1,000 grams per kilogram. So now we have everything in\\nterms of grams, but we want it in terms of milliliters. The question is, how\\nmany milliliters of solution per dose? So let me go down here on\\nthis line right here. So we had this result. We have 11/1,000-- I won't do\\nthe division just yet-- grams of drug x per kilogram. This is really just a re--\\nwe've just rewritten this dosage information\\nin different units. And let's see how much solution\\nwe need per kilogram. So I want to cancel out\\nthe grams here and have a milliliters there. So to cancel out that grams,\\nI'm going to have to have a gram in the denominator and a\\nmilliliter in the numerator. So in our solution, how many\\ngrams are there per milliliter? Well, they told us. There are 0.9 grams\\nper milliliter. Or for every 1 milliliter,\\nthere are 0.9 grams. Notice, I just took\\nthe inverse of that. Because we want a milliliter\\nin the numerator, grams in the denominator, so that\\nthese two cancel out. And let's do this\\nmultiplication now. So our grams cancel out. We have milliliters\\nper kilogram. And then we multiply it out. 11/1,000 times 1 over 0.9. So I'll just keep-- let me\\njust write it like this. So there's going to be 11/1,000\\ntimes 0.9 milliliters of our solution per kilogram. So we've gotten this far. So this is per kilogram\\nof patient body weight. And then finally, they tell\\nus how many kilograms our patient weighs. So let's do that last\\nmultiplication, and then we can actually get our calculator out\\nand do it all at once. So let's multiply this times--\\nwe want to know how many milliliters per patient. We want the kilograms\\nto cancel out. So we want kilograms\\nper patient. Now we're talking about\\nthis particular patient. Not every patient is\\ngoing to be the same number of kilograms. But if we do this,\\nkilograms will cancel out. We'll have milliliters per\\npatient-- milliliters of solution per patient-- which\\nis exactly what we want. We want milliliters of solution\\nper dose per patient. But everything we've assumed\\nso far has been per dose. So how many kilograms\\ndoes the patient weigh? Well, there's 72.7\\nkilograms per patient. That's how much the\\npatient weighs. So we just do this final\\nmultiplication and we'll be done. So our answer-- and as these\\ntwo things are going to cancel out-- so our final answer is\\ngoing to be 11 times 72.7 divided by 100 times--\\nactually, 100 times 0.9 is pretty easy to figure out. That's 900. Divided by 900\\nmilliliters per patient. Or you can just say\\nmilliliters per dose. However you want to say it. Per dose per patient. Let's get our calculator\\nout and do this. So we have 11 times 72.7 is\\nequal to 799 divided by 900. Is equal to 0.88-- well,\\nwe could round up. 0.889. Hopefully the\\ndoctor won't mind. So that is equal to-- I'll\\nwrite it in a nice, vibrant color-- 0.889 milliliters\\nof solution per dose. So this is what we're going\\nto give every 12 hours. If they ask, how many total\\nmilliliters over the course of 2 days? We would have to say,\\noh, there's 48 hours. We'd multiply it by 4. But that 12 hours was extra\\ninformation in this problem. But anyway, hopefully this is\\nuseful, and it'll ensure that any nurses serving me in the\\nfuture are giving me my proper dosage. And hopefully, the doctor even\\ngot the right dosage to begin with, because otherwise\\nit's all for naught. Anyway. \",\n",
       " '4.1.1': '- [Voiceover] What I\\'d like to\\nintroduce you to in this video is the idea of a Linear Equation. And just to start ourselves out, let\\'s look at some examples\\nof linear equations. So, for example the equation y is equal to two x minus three, this is a linear equation. Now why do we call it a linear equation? Well if you were to take\\nthe set of all of the xy pairs that satisfy this equation and if you were to graph\\nthem on the coordinate plane, you would actually get a line. That\\'s why it\\'s called a linear equation. And let\\'s actually feel\\ngood about that statement. Let\\'s see, let\\'s plot some of the xy pairs that satisfy this equation\\nand then feel good that it does indeed generate a line. So, I\\'m just gonna pick some x values and make it easy to calculate\\nthe corresponding y values. So, if x is equal to zero y is gonna be two times zero minus three which is negative three. And on our coordinate plane here that\\'s-- we\\'re gonna move zero in the x direction, zero in the horizontal direction and we\\'re gonna go down three\\nin the vertical direction, in the y direction. So, that\\'s that point there. If x is equal to one, what is y equal to? Well two times one is two,\\nminus three is negative one. So we move positive one in the x direction and negative one, or down\\none, in the y direction. Now let\\'s see, if x is\\nequal to two what is y? Two times two is four, minus three is one. When x is equal to two y is equal to one. And hopefully you\\'re seeing now that if I were to keep going, and I encourage you though if you want pause the video and try x equals three or x equals negative one and keep going. You will see that this is\\ngoing to generate a line. And in fact, let me connect these dots and you will see the line\\nthat I\\'m talking about. So, let me see if I can draw, I\\'m gonna use the line tool here. Try to connect the dots\\nas neatly as I can. There you go. This line that I have just drawn, this is the graph, this is the graph of y is\\nequal to two x minus three. So if you were to graph all\\nof the xy pairs that satisfy this equation you are gonna get this line. And you might be saying,\\n\"Hey wait wait, hold on Sal, you just tried some particular points, why don\\'t I just get a bunch of points, how do I actually get a line?\" Well, I just tried, over here I just tried\\ninteger values of x. But you can try any value in\\nbetween here, all of these, it\\'s actually a pretty unique concept. Any value of x that you input into this, you find the corresponding value for y, it will sit on this line. So for example, for example, if we were to take x is equal to, actually let\\'s say x is\\nequal to negative point five. So if x is equal to negative point five if we look at the line when x is equal to negative point five it looks like it looks like y is equal to negative four. And that looks like that sits on the line. Well let\\'s verify that. If x is equal to negative, I\\'ll write that as negative one half, then what is y equal to? Let\\'s see, two times negative one half, I\\'ll just write it out, two times negative-- two times negative one half minus three. Well this says two times\\nnegative one half is negative one minus three\\nis indeed negative four it is indeed negative four. So you can literally take any, any-- for any x value that you put here and the corresponding y value it is going to sit on the line. This point right over\\nhere represents a solution to this linear equation. Let me do this in a color you can see. So this point represents a\\nsolution to a linear equation. This point represents a\\nsolution to a linear equation. This point is not a solution\\nto a linear equation. So if ex is equal to five then y is not gonna be equal to three. If x is gonna be equal to\\nfive you go to the line to see what the solution to\\nthe linear equation is. If x is five this shows us\\nthat y is going to be seven. And it\\'s indeed-- that\\'s indeed the case. Two times five is ten,\\nminus three is seven. The point-- the point five comma seven is on, or it satisfies this linear equation. So if you take all of the\\nxy pairs that satisfy it, you get a line. That is why it is called\\na linear equation. Now, this isn\\'t the only\\nway that we could write a linear equation. You could write a linear equation like-- let me do this in a new color. You could write a linear\\nequation like this: Four x minus three y is equal to twelve. This also is a linear equation. And we can see that if we\\nwere to graph the xy pairs that satisfy this we would\\nonce again get a line. X and y. If x is equal to zero, then this goes away and you have negative three\\ny is equal to twelve. Let\\'s see, if negative\\nthree y equals twelve then y would be equal to negative four. Nega-- zero comma negative four. You can verify that. Four times zero minus\\nthree times negative four well that\\'s gonna be\\nequal to positive twelve. And let\\'s see, if y were to equal zero, if y were to equal zero then this is gonna be four\\ntimes x is equal to twelve, well then x is equal to three. And so you have the point\\nzero comma negative four, zero comma negative four on this line, and you have the point three\\ncomma zero on this line. Three comma zero. Did I do that right? Yep. So zero comma negative four\\nand then three comma zero. These are going to be on this line. Three comma zero is also on this line. So this is, this line is\\ngoing to look something like-- something like, I\\'ll\\njust try to hand draw it. Something like that. So once again, all of the xy-- all of the xy pairs that satisfy this, if you were to plot them\\nout it forms a line. Now what are some examples,\\nmaybe you\\'re saying \"Wait, wait, wait, isn\\'t any\\nequation a linear equation?\" And the simple answer is\\n\"No, not any equation is a linear equation.\" I\\'ll give you some examples\\nof non-linear equations. So a non-- non-linear, whoops let me write a\\nlittle bit neater than that. Non-linear equations. Well, those could include something like y is equal to x-squared. If you graph this you will see that this\\nis going to be a curve. it could be something like x\\ntimes y is equal to twelve. This is also not going to be a line. Or it could be something\\nlike five over x plus y is equal to ten. This also is not going to be a line. So now, and at some point you could-- I encourage you to try\\nto graph these things, they\\'re actually quite interesting. But given that we\\'ve now seen\\nexamples of linear equations and non-linear equations, let\\'s see if we can come\\nup with a definition for linear equations. One way to think about is it\\'s an equation that if you were to graph\\nall of the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation, you\\'ll get a line. And that\\'s actually\\nliterally where the word linear equation comes from. But another way to think about it is it\\'s going to be an equation where every term is either\\ngoing to be a constant, so for example, twelve is a constant. It\\'s not going to change\\nbased on the value of some variable, twelve is twelve. Or negative three is negative three. So every term is either\\ngoing to be a constant or it\\'s going to be a\\nconstant times a variable raised to the first power. So this is the constant two\\ntimes x to the first power. This is the variable y\\nraised to the first power. You could say that bceause\\nthis is just one y. We\\'re not dividing by x or y, we\\'re not multiplying, we don\\'t have a term that\\nhas x to the second power, or x to the third power,\\nor y to the fifth power. We just have y to the first power, we have x to the first power. We\\'re not multiplying x and y together like we did over here. So if every-- if every term in your equation, on either side of the equation, is either a constant or its\\njust some number times x, just x to the first power\\nor some number times y, and you\\'re not multiplying\\nyour x\\'s and y\\'s together you are dealing with a linear equation. ',\n",
       " '4.1.2': '- [Voiceover] Which of the ordered pairs is a solution of the following equation? Negative three x minus y is equal to six. What we have to remind ourselves is when we\\'re give an ordered pair, the first number is the x\\ncoordinate and the second number is the y coordinate, or the y value. So when they tell us the ordered pair, negative four comma four, they\\'re saying \"hey look, if x is equal to \"negative four, and y is\\nequal to positive four, \"does that satisfy this equation?\" And what we can do, is\\nwe can just try that out. So we have negative three\\nand everywhere we see an x, everywhere we see an x, we can replace it with negative four. So it\\'s negative three\\ntimes negative four, minus, minus and everywhere we see a y, we can replace it with positive four. We replace it with positive four. So negative three times x minus y, which is four, needs to be equal to six. Needs to be equal to six. Now is this indeed the case? Negative three times negative four is positive 12. Positive 12 minus four,\\npositive 12 minus four is equal to eight, it\\'s not equal to six. Is not equal, is not equal to six. So this one does not work out. So let\\'s see, negative three comma three. We can do the same thing here. Let\\'s see what happens when\\nx is equal to negative three and y is equal to positive three. So we substitute back in,\\nwe get negative three. Negative three times x,\\nwhich now we\\'re going to try out x being equal to negative three. Minus y, minus y. Y is positive three here. Minus y, gonna do that y color blue. Minus y now needs to be equal to, now needs to be equal, just like before needs to be equal to six. So negative three times negative three. That\\'s going to be positive nine. Nine minus three is indeed equal to six. Nine minus three is\\nindeed equal to six. Nine minus three is six. That is equal to six. This works out. So negative three comma\\nthree is an ordered pair that is a solution to this equation. ',\n",

So they\\'re gonna, if this is\\na solution, if this ordered pair is a solution, that means\\nthat if x is equal to three and y is equal to two,\\nthat that would satisfy this equation up here. So let\\'s try that out. So, we have four times x. Well we\\'re saying x needs\\nto be equal to three, minus one, is going to be\\nequal to three times y. Well, if this ordered\\npair is a solution then y is going to be equal\\nto two, so three times y, y is two, plus five. Notice all I did is wherever I saw the x, I substituted it with three, wherever I saw the y, I\\nsubstituted it with two. Now let\\'s see if this is true. Four times three is twelve, minus one. Is this really the same\\nthing as three times two which is six, plus five? See, 12 minus one is 11, six plus five is also 11. This is true, 11 equals 11. This pair three, two does\\nsatisfy this equation. Now let\\'s see whether\\nthis one does, two, three. So this is saying when x is equal to two, y would be equal to\\nthree for this equation. Let\\'s see if that\\'s true. So four times x, we\\'re\\nnow gonna see if when x is two, y can be three. So four times x, four times two, minus one is equal to three times y, now y we\\'re testing to\\nsee if it can be three. Three times three plus five, let\\'s see if this is true. Four times two is eight, minus one, is this equal to three times three? So that\\'s nine plus five. So is seven equal to 14? No, clearly seven is not equal to 14. So these things are not\\nequal to each other. So this is not a solution,\\nwhen x equals two y cannot be to three and\\nsatisfy this equation. So only three, two is a solution. ',\n",
       " '4.1.4': '- [Voiceover] So this is an example from the Khan Academy exercise,\\ngraphing solutions to two variable linear equations. And they tell us to complete the table so each row represents a solution of the following equation. And they give us the equation, and then they want us to figure out, what does y equal when x is equal to negative five? And what does x equal when y is equal to eight. And to figure this out, I\\'ve actually copied and pasted this part of the problem onto my scratchpad, so let me get that out. And so this is the exact same problem, there\\'s a couple of ways that we could try to tackle it. One way, is you could try\\nto simplify this more, get all your xs on one side and all your ys on the other side. Or we could just literally substitute when x equals negative five, what must y equal? Actually, let me do it\\nthe second way, first. So if we take this equation, and we substitute x with negative five, what do we get? We get negative three times, well, we\\'re gonna say x is negative five, times negative five, plus seven y is equal to five times, x is once again, it\\'s gonna be negative five, x is negative five, five times negative five, plus two y. See, negative three times negative five is positive 15, plus seven y, is equal to negative 25 plus two y. And now, to solve for y, let\\'s see, I could subtract\\ntwo y from both sides, so that I get rid of the\\ntwo y here on the right. So let me subtract two y, subtract two y from both sides. And then if I want all my\\nconstants on the right hand side, I can subtract 15 from both sides. So let me subtract 15 from both sides. And I\\'m going to be left with\\n15 minus 15, that\\'s zero, that\\'s the whole point of subtracting 15 from both sides, so I\\nget rid of this 15 here. Seven y minus two y. Seven of something minus\\ntwo of that same something is gonna be five of that something. It\\'s gonna be equal to five y, is equal to negative 25 minus 15. Well, that\\'s gonna be negative 40. And then two y minus two y,\\nwell, that\\'s just gonna be zero. That was the whole point of subtracting two y from both sides. So you have five times y\\nis equal to negative 40. Or, if we divide both sides by five, we divide both sides by five, we would get y is equal to negative eight. So when x is equal to negative five, y is equal to negative eight. Y is equal to negative eight. And actually we can fill that in. So this y is going to be\\nequal to negative eight. And now we gotta figure this out. What does x equal when\\ny is positive eight? Well, we can go back\\nto our scratchpad here. And I\\'ll take the same equation, but let\\'s make y equal to positive eight. So you have negative three x plus seven, now y is going to be eight, y is eight, seven times eight is\\nequal to five times x, plus two times, once again, y is eight, two times eight. So we get negative three x plus 56, that\\'s 56, is equal to five x plus 16. Now, if we wanna get all of our constants on one side, and of all of our x\\nterms on the other side, well, what could we do? Let\\'s see, we could add\\nthree x to both sides. That would get rid of\\nall the xs on this side, and put \\'em all on this side. So we\\'re gonna add three x to both sides. And, let\\'s see, if we want to get all the\\nconstants on the left hand side, we\\'d wanna get rid of the 16, so we could subtract 16\\nfrom the right hand side, if we do it from the right, we\\'re gonna have to do\\nit from the left as well. And we\\'re gonna be left\\nwith, these cancel out, 56 minus 16 is positive 40. And then, let\\'s see, 16 minus 16 is zero. Five x plus three x is equal to eight x. We get eight x is equal to 40. We could divide both sides by eight, and we get, five is equal to x. So this right over here is going to be equal to five. So let\\'s go back, let\\'s go back, now. So when y is positive eight, x is positive five. Now they ask us, \"Use your two solutions \"to graph the equation.\" So let\\'s see if we can do, oh, whoops, let me, let\\nme use my mouse now. So to graph the equations. So when x is negative\\nfive, y is negative eight. So the point negative\\nfive comma negative eight. So that\\'s right over there. So let me move my browser\\nup so you can see that. Negative five, when x is negative five, y is negative eight. And when x is positive five, and we see that up here, when x is positive five,\\ny is positive eight. When x is positive five,\\ny is positive eight. And we\\'re done. We can check our answer, if we like. We got it right. Now, I said there was\\ntwo ways to tackle it, I kind of just did it, I guess\\nyou could say, the naive way. I just substituted negative five directly into this and solved for y. And then I substituted\\ny equals positive eight directly into this, and then solved for x. Another way that I could have done it, that actually probably would have been, or, it would for sure, would have been the easier way to do it, is ahead of time to try to\\nsimplify this expression. So what I could have done,\\nright from the get-go, is said, \"Hey, let\\'s put\\nall my xs on one side, \"and all my ys on the other side.\" So this is negative three x plus seven y is equal to five x plus two y. Now let\\'s say I wanna\\nget all my ys on the left and all my xs on the right. So I don\\'t want this\\nnegative three x on the left, so I\\'d wanna add three x. Adding three x would cancel this out, but I can\\'t just do it\\non the left hand side, I have to do it on the\\nright hand side as well. And then, if I wanna get rid\\nof this two y on the right, I could subtract two y from the right, but, of course, I\\'d also\\nwanna do it from the left. And then what am I left with? So negative three x plus three x is zero, seven y minus two y is five y. And then I have five x plus three x is eight x. Two y minus two y is zero. And then if I wanted\\nto, I could solve for y, I could divide both sides by five and I\\'d get y is equal to 8/5 x. So, this right over here represents the same exact equation as this over here, it\\'s just written in a different way. All of the xy pairs that satisfy this, would satisfy this, and vice versa. And this is much easier. Because if x is now negative five, if x is negative five, y would be 8/5 times negative five, well, that\\'s going to be negative eight. And when y is equal to eight, well, you actually could\\neven do this up here, you could say five times\\neight is equal to eight x, and then you could see, well five times eight the same\\nthing as eight times five, so x would be equal to five. So I think this would actually have been a simpler way to do it. You see it all, I was able\\nto do the entire problem in this little white space here, instead of having to do all of this, slightly, slightly hairier, algebra. ',\n",
       " '4.2.1': \"- [Voiceover] As we start to graph lines, we might notice that they're\\ndifferences between lines. For example, this pink or\\nthis magenta line here, it looks steeper than this blue line. And what we'll see is\\nthis notion of steepness, how steep a line is, how\\nquickly does it increase or how quickly does it decrease, is a really useful idea in mathematics. So ideally, we'd be\\nable to assign a number to each of these lines\\nor to any lines that describes how steep it is, how quickly does it increase or decrease? So what's a reasonable way to do that? What's a reasonable way to assign a number to these lines that\\ndescribe their steepness? Well one way to think\\nabout it, could say well, how much does a line increase in the vertical direction for a given increase in\\nthe horizontal direction? So let's write this down. So let's say if we an increase increase, in vertical, in vertical, for a given increase in horizontal for a given increase a given increase in horizontal. So, how can this give us a value? Well let's look at that\\nmagenta line again. Now let's just start at an arbituary point in that magenta line. But I'll start at a point where it's going to be easy for me to figure out what point we're at. So if we were to start right here, and if I were to increase\\nin the horizontal direction by one. So I move one to the right. To get back on the line, how much do I have to increase in\\nthe vertical direction? Well I have to increase in\\nthe vertical direction by two. By two. So at least for this magenta line, it looks like our increase in vertical is two, whenever we have an increase in one in the horizontal direction. Let's see, does that\\nstill work if I were to start here, instead of\\nincreasing the horizontal direction by one, if I were increase in the horizontal direction... So let's increase by three. So now, I've gone plus three in the horizontal direction, then to get back on the line, how much do I have to increase\\nin the vertical direction? I have to increase by one,\\ntwo, three, four, five, six I have to increase by six. So plus six. So when I increase by three in the horizontal direction, I increase by six in the vertical. We were just saying,\\nhey, let's just measure how much to we increase in vertical for a given increase in the horizontal? Well two over one is just two and that's the same\\nthing as six over three. So no matter where I start on this line, no matter where I start on this line, if I take and if I increase\\nin the horizontal direction by a given amount, I'm going to increase twice as much twice as much in the vertical direction. Twice as much in the vertical direction. So this notion of this\\nincrease in vertical divided by increase in horizontal, this is what mathematicians\\nuse to describe the steepness of lines. And this is called the slope. So this is called the slope of a line. And you're probably\\nfamiliar with the notion of the word slope being\\nused for a ski slope, and that's because a ski slope\\nhas a certain inclination. It could have a steep\\nslope or a shallow slope. So slope is a measure for\\nhow steep something is. And the convention is, is\\nwe measure the increase in vertical for a given\\nin increase in horizontal. So six two over one is\\nequal to six over three is equal to two, this\\nis equal to the slope of this magenta line. So let me write this down. So this slope right over\\nhere, the slope of that line, is going to be equal to two. And one way to interpret that, for whatever amount you increase in the horizontal direction,\\nyou're going to increase twice as much in the vertical direction. Now what about this blue line here? What would be the slope of the blue line? Well, let me rewrite another\\nway that you'll typically see the definition of slope. And this is just the\\nconvention that mathematicians have defined for slope but it's a valuable one. What is are is our change in vertical for a given change in horizontal? And I'll introduce a new notation for you. So, change in vertical, and in this coordinate, the vertical is our Y coordinate. divided by our change in horizontal. And X is our horizontal coordinate in this coordinate plane right over here. So wait, you said change in but then you drew this triangle. Well this is the Greek letter delta. This is the Greek letter delta. And it's a math symbol used\\nto represent change in. So that's delta, delta. And it literally means, change in Y, change in Y, divided by change in X, change in X. So if we want to find the\\nslope of the blue line, we just have to say, well\\nhow much does Y change for a given change in X? So, the slope of the blue line. So let's see, let me do it this way. Let's just start at some point here. And let's say my X changes by two so my delta X is equal to positive two. What's my delta Y going to be? What's going to be my change in Y? Well, if I go by the right by two, to get back on the line, I'll have to increase my Y by two. So my change in Y is also\\ngoing to be plus two. So the slope of this blue line, the slope of the blue line, which is change in Y over change in X. We just saw that when our\\nchange in X is positive two, our change in Y is also positive two. So our slope is two divided by two, which is equal to one. Which tells us however much we increase in X, we're going to increase\\nthe same amount in Y. We see that, we increase\\none in X, we increase one in Y. Increase one in X, increase one in Y. >From any point on the line,\\nthat's going to be true. You increase three in X, you're going to increase three in Y. It's actually true the other way. If you decrease one in X, you're going to decrease one in Y. If you decrease two in X, you're going to decrease two in Y. And that makes sense from\\nthe math of it as well Because if you're change\\nin X is negative two, that's what we did right over here, our change is X is negative two, we went two back, then your change in Y is going\\nto be negative two as well. Your change in Y is\\ngoing to be negative two, and negative two divided by negative two, is positive one, which\\nis your slope again. \",\n",
       " '4.2.2': \"- [Voiceover] Slope is\\ndefined as your change in the vertical direction, and I could use the Greek letter delta,\\nthis little triangle here is the Greek letter\\ndelta, it means change in. Change in the vertical\\ndirection divided by change in the horizontal direction. That is the standard definition of slope and it's a reasonable way for measuring how steep something is. So for example, if we're\\nlooking at the xy plane here, our change in the vertical direction is gonna be a change in the y variable divided by change in horizontal direction, is gonna be a change in the x variable. So let's see why that is a\\ngood definition for slope. Well I could draw something\\nwith a slope of one. A slope of one might\\nlook something like... so a slope of one, as x increases by one, y increases by one, so a slope of one... is going to look like this. Notice, however much my change in x is, so for example here, my\\nchange in x is positive two, I'm gonna have the same change in y. My change in y is going to be plus two. So my change in y divided by change in x is two divided by two is one. So for this line I have\\nslope is equal to one. But what would a slope of two look like? Well, a slope of two should be\\nsteeper and we can draw that. Let me start at a different point, so if I start over here a\\nslope of two would look like... for every one that I\\nincrease in the x direction I'm gonna increase two in the y direction, so it's going to look like... that. This line right over here, you see it. If my change in x is equal to one, my change in y is two. So change in y over\\nchange in x is gonna be two over one, the slope here is two. And now, hopefully, you're appreciating why this definition of\\nslope is a good one. The higher the slope, the\\nsteeper it is, the faster it increases, the faster\\nwe increase in the vertical direction as we increase in\\nthe horizontal direction. Now what would a negative slope be? So let's just think about what a line with a negative slope would mean. A negative slope would mean,\\nwell we could take an example. If we have our change\\nin y over change in x was equal to a negative one. That means that if we\\nhave a change in x of one, then in order to get\\nnegative one here, that means that our change in y would have\\nto be equal to negative one. So a line with a negative\\none slope would look like... would look like this. Notice, as x increases\\nby a certain amount, so our delta x here is one, y decreases by that same\\namount instead of increasing. So now this is what we consider\\na downward sloping line. So change in y is equal to negative one. So our change in y over our change in x is equal to negative one over one which is equal to negative one. So the slope of this line is negative one. Now if you had a slope with negative two, it would decrease even faster. So a line with a slope of negative two could look something like this. So as x increases by one,\\ny would decrease by two. So it would look something like... it would look like that. Notice, as our x increases\\nby a certain amount, our y decreases by twice as much. So this right over here has a slope of negative two. So hopefully this gives you a little bit more intuition for what slope represents and how the number that\\nwe use to represent slope, how you can use that to\\nvisualize how steep a line is. A very high positive\\nslope, as x increases, y is going to increase\\nfairly dramatically. If you have a negative slope... as x increases, your y is\\nactually going to decrease. And then the higher\\nthe slope, the steeper, the more you increase as x increases, and the more negative the slope, the more you decrease as x increases. \",\n",
       " '4.2.3': \"Find the slope of the\\nline in the graph. And just as a bit of a review,\\nslope is just telling us how steep a line is. And the best way to view it,\\nslope is equal to change in y over change in x. And for a line, this will\\nalways be constant. And sometimes you might see it\\nwritten like this: you might see this triangle, that's a\\ncapital delta, that means change in, change in\\ny over change in x. That's just a fancy way\\nof saying change in y over change in x. So let's see what this change\\nin y is for any change in x. So let's start at some point\\nthat seems pretty reasonable to read from this table right\\nhere, from this graph. So let's see, we're starting\\nhere-- let me do it in a more vibrant color-- so let's\\nsay we start at that point right there. And we want to go to another\\npoint that's pretty straightforward to read,\\nso we can move to that point right there. We could literally pick any\\ntwo points on this line. I'm just picking ones that are\\nnice integer coordinates, so it's easy to read. So what is the change in y and\\nwhat is the change in x? So first let's look at\\nthe change in x. So if we go from there\\nto there, what is the change in x? My change in x is\\nequal to what? Well, I can just count it out. I went 1 steps, 2\\nsteps, 3 steps. My change in x is 3. And you could even see\\nit from the x values. If I go from negative 3\\nto 0, I went up by 3. So my change in x is 3. So let me write this, change in\\nx, delta x is equal to 3. And what's my change in y? Well, my change in y, I'm going\\nfrom negative 3 up to negative 1, or you could\\njust say 1, 2. So my change in y, is\\nequal to positive 2. So let me write that down. Change in y is equal to 2. So what is my change in\\ny for a change in x? Well, when my change in x was\\n3, my change in y is 2. So this is my slope. And one thing I want to do, I\\nwant to show you that I could have really picked any\\ntwo points here. Let's say I didn't pick-- let me\\nclear this out-- let's say I didn't pick those two points,\\nlet me pick some other points, and I'll even go in\\na different direction. I want to show you that you're\\ngoing to get the same answer. Let's say I've used this as my\\nstarting point, and I want to go all the way over there. Well, let's think about the\\nchange in y first. So the change in y, I'm going down\\nby how many units? 1, 2, 3, 4 units, so my change\\nin y, in this example, is negative 4. I went from 1 to negative\\n3, that's negative 4. That's my change in y. Change in y is equal\\nto negative 4. Now what is my change in x? Well I'm going from this point,\\nor from this x value, all the way-- let me do that in\\na different color-- all the way back like this. So I'm going to the left, so\\nit's going to be a negative change in x, and I went 1,\\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6 units back. So my change in x is equal\\nto negative 6. And you can even see I started\\nit at x is equal to 3, and I went all the way to x is\\nequal to negative 3. That's a change of negative 6. I went 6 to the left, or\\na change of negative 6. So what is my change in\\ny over change in x? My change in y over change in x\\nis equal to negative 4 over negative 6. The negatives cancel out\\nand what's 4 over 6? Well, that's just 2 over 3. So it's the same value, you just\\nhave to be consistent. If this is my start point,\\nI went down 4, and then I went back 6. Negative 4 over negative 6. If I viewed this as my starting\\npoint, I could say that I went up 4, so it would\\nbe a change in y would be 4, and then my change\\nin x would be 6. And either way, once again,\\nchange in y over change in x is going to be 4 over 6, 2/3. So no matter which point you\\nchoose, as long as you kind of think about it in a consistent\\nway, you're going to get the same value for slope. \",\n",
       " '4.2.4': \"- [Instructor] We are asked, what is the slope of the line\\nthat contains these points? So pause this video and see\\nif you can work through this on your own before we do it together. Alright, now let's do it together, and let's just remind\\nourselves what slope is. Slope is equal to change in y, this is the Greek letter delta, look likes a triangle, but it's shorthand for change in y over change in x. Sometimes you would see\\nit written as y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 where you could kind of view\\nx1 y1 as the starting point and x2 y2 as the ending point. So let's just pick two xy pairs here, and we can actually pick any two if we can assume that this is\\nactually describing a line. So we might as well\\njust pick the first two. So let's say that's our starting point and that's our finishing point. So what is our change in x here? So we're going from two to three, so our change in x is\\nequal to three minus two which is equal to one, and you can see that\\nto go from two to three you're just adding one. And what's our change in y? Our change in y is our finishing y one minus our starting y four, which\\nis equal to negative three. And you could of, you didn't\\neven have to do this math, you would have been able to see to go from two to three you added one, and to go from four to one,\\nyou have to subtract three. For there we have all\\nthe information we need. What is change in y over change in x? Well, it's going to be, our change in y is negative three and our change in x is one. So our slope is negative\\nthree divided by one is negative three. Let's do another example. Here we are asked, what is the slope of the line that contains these points? So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure it out or pause the video again and\\nsee if you can figure it out. Alright, so remember, slope\\nis equal to change in y over change in x. And we should be able to\\npick any two of these pairs in order to figure that out if we assume that this is indeed a line. Well, just for variety, let's\\npick these middle two pairs. So what's our change in x? To go from one to five, we added four. And what's our change in y? To go from seven to 13, we added six. So our change in y is six\\nwhen our change in x is four. And I got the signs right,\\nin both case it's a positive. When x increases, y increased as well. So our slope is six fourths, and we could rewrite that if we like. Both six and four are divisible by two, so let be divide both the\\nnumerator and the denominator by two and we get three\\nhalves, and we're done. \",\n",
       " '4.2.5': 'Find the slope of\\nthe line that goes through the ordered pairs\\n4 comma 2 and negative 3 comma 16. So just as a reminder, slope\\nis defined as rise over run. Or, you could view that rise\\nis just change in y and run is just change in x. The triangles here,\\nthat\\'s the delta symbol. It literally means \"change in.\" Or another way, and you\\nmight see this formula, and it tends to be\\nreally complicated. But just remember it\\'s just\\nthese two things over here. Sometimes, slope will be\\nspecified with the variable m. And they\\'ll say that\\nm is the same thing-- and this is really the\\nsame thing as change in y. They\\'ll write y2 minus\\ny1 over x2 minus x1. And this notation tends\\nto be kind of complicated, but all this means\\nis, is you take the y-value of your endpoint\\nand subtract from it the y-value of your\\nstarting point. That will essentially\\ngive you your change in y. And it says take the\\nx-value of your endpoint and subtract from that the\\nx-value of your starting point. And that\\'ll give\\nyou change in x. So whatever of\\nthese work for you, let\\'s actually figure out\\nthe slope of the line that goes through these two points. So we\\'re starting\\nat-- and actually, we could do it both ways. We could start at this\\npoint and go to that point and calculate the slope or\\nwe could start at this point and go to that point\\nand calculate the slope. So let\\'s do it both ways. So let\\'s say that our starting\\npoint is the point 4 comma 2. And let\\'s say that our endpoint\\nis negative 3 comma 16. So what is the change\\nin x over here? What is the change in\\nx in this scenario? So we\\'re going from\\n4 to negative 3. If something goes\\nfrom 4 to negative 3, what was it\\'s change? You have to go\\ndown 4 to get to 0, and then you have to go down\\nanother 3 to get to negative 3. So our change in x\\nhere is negative 7. Actually, let me\\nwrite it this way. Our change in x is equal\\nto negative 3 minus 4, which is equal to negative 7. If I\\'m going from 4 to\\nnegative 3, I went down by 7. Our change in x is negative 7. Let\\'s do the same thing\\nfor the change in y. And notice, I implicitly\\nuse this formula over here. Our change in x was this value,\\nour endpoint, our end x-value minus our starting x-value. Let\\'s do the same thing\\nfor our change in y. Our change in y. If we\\'re starting at\\n2 and we go to 16, that means we moved up 14. Or another way you\\ncould say it, you could take your ending\\ny-value and subtract from that your starting y-value\\nand you get 14. So what is the slope over here? Well, the slope is just\\nchange in y over change in x. So the slope over\\nhere is change in y over change in x, which\\nis-- our change in y is 14. And our change in\\nx is negative 7. And then if we want to simplify\\nthis, 14 divided by negative 7 is negative 2. Now, what I want\\nto show you is, is that we could have done\\nit the other way around. We could have made\\nthis the starting point and this the endpoint. And what we would have\\ngotten is the negative values of each of these, but then\\nthey would\\'ve canceled out and we would still\\nget negative 2. Let\\'s try it out. So let\\'s say that our start\\npoint was negative 3 comma 16. And let\\'s say that our\\nendpoint is the 4 comma 2. 4 comma 2. So in this situation,\\nwhat is our change in x? Our change in x. If I start at negative\\n3 and I go to 4, that means I went up 7. Or if you want to\\njust calculate that, you would do 4 minus negative 3. 4 minus negative 3. But needless to say,\\nwe just went up 7. And what is our change in y? Our change in y over here,\\nor we could say our rise. If we start at 16 and we end at\\n2, that means we went down 14. Or you could just say 2\\nminus 16 is negative 14. We went down by 14. This was our run. So if you say rise\\nover run, which is the same thing as change\\nin y over change in x, our rise is negative 14\\nand our run here is 7. So notice, these are\\njust the negatives of these values from\\nwhen we swapped them. So once again, this is\\nequal to negative 2. And let\\'s just visualize this. Let me do a quick\\ngraph here just to show you what a downward\\nslope would look like. So let me draw our two points. So this is my x-axis. That is my y-axis. So this point over\\nhere, 4 comma 2. So let me graph it. So we\\'re going to go\\nall the way up to 16. So let me save some space here. So we have 1, 2, 3, 4. It\\'s 4 comma-- 1, 2. So 4 comma 2 is right over here. 4 comma 2. Then we have the point\\nnegative 3 comma 16. So let me draw that over here. So we have negative 1, 2, 3. And we have to go up 16. So this is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\\n9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So it goes right over here. So this is negative 3 comma 16. Negative 3 comma 16. So the line that\\ngoes between them is going to look\\nsomething like this. Try my best to draw a\\nrelatively straight line. That line will keep going. So the line will keep going. So that\\'s my best attempt. And now notice, it\\'s\\ndownward sloping. As you increase an x-value,\\nthe line goes down. It\\'s going from the top\\nleft to the bottom right. As x gets bigger,\\ny gets smaller. That\\'s what a downward-sloping\\nline looks like. And just to visualize our\\nchange in x\\'s and our change in y\\'s that we dealt with\\nhere, when we started at 4 and we ended at-- or when\\nwe started at 4 comma 2 and ended at\\nnegative 3 comma 16, that was analogous to starting\\nhere and ending over there. And we said our change\\nin x was negative 7. We had to move back. Our run we had to move in\\nthe left direction by 7. That\\'s why it was a negative 7. And then we had to move\\nin the y-direction. We had to move in the\\ny-direction positive 14. So that\\'s why our\\nrise was positive. So it\\'s 14 over negative\\n7, or negative 2. When we did it the other way,\\nwe started at this point. We started at this point,\\nand then ended at this point. Started at negative 3, 16\\nand ended at that point. So in that situation,\\nour run was positive 7. And now we have to go\\ndown in the y-direction since we switched the\\nstarting and the endpoint. And now we had to\\ngo down negative 14. Our run is now positive 7 and\\nour rise is now negative 14. Either way, we got\\nthe same slope. ',\n",

Now, they're asking us to find\\nthe slope of the line that goes through the ordered pairs. Find the slope of this line.

My change in y is going to be 0. My y value does not\\nchange no matter how much I change my x value. So the slope here\\nis going to be-- when we run 10,\\nwhat was our rise? How much did we change in y? Well, we didn't rise at all. We didn't go up or down. So the slope here is 0. Or another way to think about\\nis this line has no inclination. It's a completely flat-- it's\\na completely horizontal line. So this should make sense. This is a 0. The slope here is 0. And just to make\\nsure that this gels with all of these other\\nformulas that you might know-- but I want to make\\nit very clear. These are all just\\ntelling you rise over run or change in y over change in\\nx, a way to measure inclination. But let's just\\napply them just so, hopefully, it all\\nmakes sense to you. So we could also say slope is\\nchange in y over change in x. If we take this to be\\nour start and if we take this to be our\\nend point, then we would call this over here x1. And then this is over here. This is y1. And then we would\\ncall this x2 and we would call this y2, if\\nthis is our start point and that is our end point. And so the slope here, the\\nchange in y, y2 minus y1. So it's negative 1\\nminus negative 1, all of that over x2, negative\\n3, minus x1, minus 7. So the numerator, negative\\n1 minus negative 1, that's the same thing\\nas negative 1 plus 1. And our denominator\\nis negative 3 minus 7, which is negative 10. So once again, negative 1\\nplus 1 is 0 over negative 10. And this is still going to be 0. And the only reason why\\nwe got a negative 10 here and a positive 10\\nthere is because we swapped the starting\\nand the ending point.

       " '4.4.1': \"- [Voiceover] Let's say that\\nwe have the linear equation, y = 1/2x - 3. So if we wanted to draw\\nthe line that represents the set of all points, all the\\ncoordinates where the x value and the y value satisfy this equation, we could start off by just trying to draw, by trying to draw a few of those points, and then connecting them with a line. Let's set up a little table here x, y. And we can just try a\\ncouple of x values here, then figure out what the\\ncorresponding y values are. I'm going to pick x\\nvalues where it's going to be fairly easy to\\ncalculate the y values. Let's say when x is equal to zero, then you're gonna have 1/2 x 0 - 3, well then y is going to be -3. When x is, let me try x\\n= 2, because then 1/2 x 2 is just gonna be 1. So when x = 2, you're going to have 1/2 x 2 = 1, -3 is -2. When x is equal to, let's try 4. So 1/2 x 4 is 2, and then -3 is -1, and we could keep going but actually all we need is two points for a line. So we're ready to plot\\nthis line if we'd like. The point 0, -3 is on this line. 0, -3 and actually let me do\\nthis in a slightly darker color so that we can see it on\\nthis white background. 0, -3 is on the line,\\n2, -2 is on the line. So 2, -2 and then we have 4, -1. So when x is 4, y is -1, and I could draw a line\\nthat connects all of these so it would look something like... If I, let's see if I could do this. It would look something like, it would something like, like that. So this right over\\nhere, this is literally, this is the graph of y = 1/2x - 3. Now when we look at a graph like this an interesting thing that\\nwe might want to ask ourself is where does the graph\\nintersect our axes? So first we can say, well where does in intersect our x-axis? When you look at this, it looks like it happens at this point right over here. This point where a\\ngraph intersects an axes this is called an intercept. This one in particular is\\ncalled the x-intercept. Why is it called the x-intercept? Because that's where the graph is intersecting the x-axis and the x-intercept, it looks like this is at the .6, 0. Now it's very interesting, the x-intercept happens when y = 0. Remember, you're on the x-axis when you haven't moved up\\nor down from that axis which means y = 0. So your x-intercept\\nhappens at x = 6, y = 0. It's this coordinate. Now what about the y-intercept? Well the y-intercept is\\nthis point right over here. This is where you intersect or I guess you could say intercept the y-axis. So this right over here, that over there is the y-intercept. The y-intercept is at the coordinate that has a 0 for the x-coordinate. X is 0 here and y is -3. X is 0 and y is -3. This was actually one of the points, or one of the pairs\\nthat we first tried out. You can validate that 6,\\n0 satisfies this equation right over here. If x is 6, 1/2 x 6 is 3,\\n-3 is indeed equal to 0. So now that we know\\nwhat an x-intercept is, it's the point where a\\ngraph intersects the x-axis or intercepts the x-axis\\nand the y-intercept is the point where a graph\\nintercepts the y-axis or intersects the y-axis. Let's try to see if we can\\nfind the x and y-intercepts for a few other linear equations. So let's say that I had\\nthe linear equation. Let's say that I have 5x + 6y = 30. I encourage you to pause this video, and figure out what are\\nthe x and y-intercepts for the graph that\\nrepresents the solutions, all the xy pairs that\\nsatisfy this equation. Well the easiest thing to do here, let's see what the y value is when x = 0 and what x value is when y = 0. When x = 0 this becomes 6y = 30. So 6 times what is 30? Well y would be equal to 5 here. So when x is 0, y is 5. What about when y is 0? Well when y is 0, that's going to be 0, and you have 5x = 30. Well then x would be equal to 6. Then x would be equal to 6. So we could plot those points, 0, 5. When x is 0, y is 5. When x is 6, y is 0. So those are both points on this graph and then the actual graph is going to, or the actual line that\\nrepresents the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation\\nis going to look like, it's going to look like this. I'll just try. So I can make it go, it's\\ngoing to look like... It's going to go through those two points. So it going to...I can make\\nit go the other way too. Let me see. It's going to go through those two points and so it's going to\\nlook something like that. Now what are its' x and y-intercepts? Well, we already kind of figured it out but the intercepts themselves, these are the points on the graph where they intersect the axes. So this right over here,\\nthis is the y-intercept. That point is the y-intercept and it happens, it's\\nalways going to happen when x = 0, and when x\\n= 0 we know that y = 5. It's that point, the point 0, 5. And what is the y inter...what\\nis the x-intercept? The x-intercept is the\\npoint, it's actually the same x-intercept for this\\nequation right over here. It's the point 6, 0. That\\npoint right over there. \",\n",
       " '4.4.2': \"The graph of the line\\n2y plus 3x equals 7 is given right over here. Determine its x-intercept. The x-intercept is the x\\nvalue when y is equal to 0, or it's the x value\\nwhere our graph actually intersects the x-axis. Notice right over here\\nour y value is exactly 0. We're sitting on the x-axis. So let's think about what\\nthis x value must be. Well, just trying to\\neyeball a little bit, it's a little over 2. It's between 2 and 3. It looks like it's\\nless than 2 and 1/2. But we don't know\\nthe exact value. So let's go turn to the equation\\nto figure out the exact value. We essentially\\nhave to figure out what x value, when\\ny is equal to 0, will have this equation be true. So we could just say 2 times\\n0 plus 3x is equal to 7. Well, 2 times 0 is\\njust going to be 0, so we have 3x is equal to 7. Then we can divide both\\nsides by 3 to solve for x, and we get x is equal to 7/3. Does that look like 7/3? Well, we just have\\nto remind ourselves that 7/3 is the same\\nthing as 6/3 plus 1/3. And 6/3 is 2. So this is the same\\nthing as 2 and 1/3. Another way you could\\nthink about it is 3 goes into 7 two times, and\\nthen you have a remainder of 1. So you've still got\\nto divide that 1 by 3. It's 2 full times\\nand then a 1/3, so this looks like 2 and 1/3. And so that's its\\nx-intercept, 7/3. If I was doing this on the\\nexercise on Khan Academy, it's always a little easier to\\ntype in the improper fraction, so I would put in 7/3. \",\n",
       " '4.4.3': \"We have the equation negative 5x\\nplus 4y is equal to 20, and we're told to find the\\nintercepts of this equation. So we have to find the\\nintercepts and then use the intercepts to graph this line\\non the coordinate plane. So then graph the line. So whenever someone talks about\\nintercepts, they're talking about where you're\\nintersecting the x and the y-axes. So let me label my axes here, so\\nthis is the x-axis and that is the y-axis there. And when I intersect the x-axis,\\nwhat's going on? What is my y value when\\nI'm at the x-axis? Well, my y value is 0, I'm not\\nabove or below the x-axis. Let me write this down. The x-intercept is when y\\nis equal to 0, right? And then by that same\\nargument, what's the y-intercept? Well, if I'm somewhere along the\\ny-axis, what's my x value? Well, I'm not to the right or\\nthe left, so my x value has to be 0, so the y-intercept occurs\\nwhen x is equal to 0. So to figure out the intercepts,\\nlet's set y equal to 0 in this equation and solve\\nfor x, and then let's set x is equal to 0 and\\nthen solve for y. So when y is equal to 0, what\\ndoes this equation become? I'll do it in orange. You get negative 5x plus 4y. Well we're saying y is 0, so\\n4 times 0 is equal to 20. 4 times 0 is just 0, so we\\ncan just not write that. So let me just rewrite it. So we have negative\\n5x is equal to 20. We can divide both sides of this\\nequation by negative 5. The negative 5 cancel out,\\nthat was the whole point behind dividing by negative 5,\\nand we get x is equal to 20 divided by negative\\n5 is negative 4. So when y is equal to 0, we\\nsaw that right there, x is equal to negative 4. Or if we wanted to plot that\\npoint, we always put the x coordinate first, so that\\nwould be the point negative 4 comma 0. So let me graph that. So if we go 1, 2, 3, 4. That's a negative 4. And then the y value is\\njust 0, so that point is right over there. That is the x-intercept, y\\nis 0, x is negative 4. Notice we're intersecting\\nthe x-axis. Now let's do the exact same\\nthing for the y-intercept. Let's set x equal to 0, so if\\nwe set x is equal to 0, we have negative 5 times 0 plus\\n4y is equal to 20. Well, anything times 0 is\\n0, so we can just put that out of the way. And remember, this was setting\\nx is equal to 0, we're doing the y-intercept now. So this just simplifies\\nto 4y is equal to 20. We can divide both sides of this\\nequation by 4 to get rid of this 4 right there, and you\\nget y is equal to 20 over 4, which is 5. So when x is equal to\\n0, y is equal to 5. So the point 0, 5 is on the\\ngraph for this line. So 0, 5. x is 0 and y is 1, 2, 3,\\n4, 5, right over there.

This is our y-axis. This is our x-axis. The y-intercept is where\\nwe intersect the y-axis. Now, what do we know\\nabout the y-intercept? Well, at the y-intercept x\\nis going to be equal to 0. So this is the point\\n0 comma something. And so when people\\nare talking about, what is your y-intercept? They're usually\\nsaying, well, what is the y-coordinate\\nwhen x equals 0. So we're really\\ntrying to figure out, what is the y-coordinate\\nwhen x equals 0? So we know the x-coordinate\\nwhen y is equal to 0. So this is actually\\nthe x-intercept. So this point right over\\nhere is the point 2 comma 0. So when people say\\nx-intercept, that's the x-coordinate\\nwhen y equals 0. Well, they gave us\\nthe x-intercept. So that right over there\\nis the x-intercept. But what's the y-intercept? What is the y-value\\nwhen x equals 0? Well, let's see. They give us what happens to\\ny when x is negative 2, when it's 1, when it's\\n2, when it's 4. So maybe we can backtrack\\nfrom one of these to get back to what happens\\nwhen x is equal to 0. So let me rewrite this table\\nso I can give ourselves a little bit more\\nbreathing room. So let's say we have\\nx and we have y. x and y. And they already tell us that\\nwhen x is negative 2, y is 8. And I actually want\\nto think about what happens when x is\\nnegative 1, when x is 0. Then they tell us\\nwhen x is 1, y is 2. When x is 2, y is 0. This right over here\\nis the x-intercept. When x is 4, y is negative 4. So they skip 2 right over\\nhere. y is negative 4. So let's just see how y changes\\nwith respect to changes in x. So when we go here, when x\\nchanges by 1, y goes down by 2. And it's a line, so\\nit's going to have a constant rate of change\\nof y with respect to x. So similarly, when\\nx increases by 1, y is going to decrease by 2. So y is going to be 6 here. When x increases by 1 again,\\ny is going to decrease by 2. So we're going to get to 4. And we see it works. Because if we\\nincrease by 1 again, then it is indeed the case\\nthat y decreased by 2. And you see here when\\nwe increase x by 2, then y decreases\\nat twice the rate. Because now we didn't\\njust increase by 1, we increased by 2. So now y is going\\nto decrease by 4. And what's constant\\nhere is your change in y over your change in x. When x increases by\\n1, y decreases by 2. When x increases by\\n2, y decreases by 4. Either way you think\\nabout it, your change in y for a unit\\nchange in x is going to be equal to negative 2. But anyway, we actually\\nanswered the question before without even\\nrealizing it when we filled in all\\nof these values. What is the y-value\\nwhen x equals 0? Well, the y-value is 4. So the y-intercept here is 4. We didn't really\\ngraph this to scale. It would actually look a\\nlittle bit more like this if we were to try to\\ngraph it properly. So this right over here is 4. This right over here is 2. And our line looks\\nsomething like this. Our line will look\\nsomething like that. \",\n",

How long does it take for\\nthe tub to drain completely? Pause this video and see if\\nyou can answer any or all of these questions based on\\nthis graph right over here. All right, now let's do it together. And let's start with this first question. How much water was in the tub\\nwhen Glen started draining? So what we see here is\\nwhen we're talking about when Glen started draining, that would be at time t equals zero. So time t equals zero is right over here. And then so how much water is in the tub? It's right over there. And this point, when\\nyou're looking at a graph, often has a special label.

All right, so they're\\nreally asking about a rate. What's the rate at which\\nwater's draining every minute? So let's see if we can find\\ntwo points on this graph that look pretty clear. So right over there at time one minute, looks like there's 12\\nliters in it, in the tub. And then at time two minutes,\\nthink there's nine liters. So it looks like as one minute passes, so we go plus one minute, plus one minute, what happens\\nto the water in the tub? Well, it looks like the water\\nin the tub goes down by, went from 12 liters to nine liters. So negative three liters. And this is a line, so\\nthat should keep happening. So if we forward another plus one minute, we should go down another three liters, and that is exactly what is happening. So it looks like the tub is draining three liters per minute. So draining three liters per minute. And so if they say every two minutes, well, if you're doing three\\nliters per every one minute, then you're going to do twice\\nas much every two minutes. So six liters every two minutes. Two minutes. But all of this, the second question, we were able to answer\\nby looking at the slope. So in this context, y-intercept\\nto help us figure out, well, where did we start off? The slope is telling us the rate at which the water in\\nthis case is changing. And then they ask us how long does it take for the tub to drain completely? Pause this video and see\\nif you can answer that. Well, the situation in which\\nthe tub has drained completely, that means the there's\\nno water left in the tub. So that means that our y-value, our water value is down at zero. And that happens on the\\ngraph right over there. And this point where the\\ngraph intersects the x-axis, that's known as the x-intercept. And in this context, it says, hey, at what x-value do we not\\nhave any of the y-value left? The water has run out. And we see that happens\\nat an x-value of five, but that's giving us the time in minutes. So that happens at five minutes. After five minutes, all\\nof the water has drained. And that makes us a lot of sense. If you have 15 liters and you're draining three\\nliters every minute, it makes sense that it takes five minutes to drain all 15 liters. \",\n",
       " '4.5.2': \"- [Instructor] Flynn's\\nsister loaned him some money, and he paid her back over time. Flynn graphed the relationship\\nbetween how much time had passed, in weeks, since\\nthe loan and how much money he still owed his sister. What feature of the graph represents how long it took Flynn\\nto pay back the loan? Pause this video, see if\\nyou can figure that out. All right, now let's go\\nthrough each of these choices. So the first one is the slope. So the slope tells us how much do we change in\\nthe vertical direction for any given change in\\nthe horizontal direction. So for example, if we start from here, we can see that if one week goes by, we go from one week to two weeks, we can see that our loan went down. It went from $15 to $10. So when we had plus one weeks in time, our loan went down by $5. And then that happens over the next week. And that rate of how\\nquickly the loan is paid, that's what the slope tells us. And it would be constant over the course of the entire time period\\nis what makes this a line, is that slope is always\\ngoing to be constant. So the slope is useful for the rate at which the loan is being paid back, but it's not the clearest\\nway to figure out how long it took Flynn\\nto pay back the loan. So I would rule that one out. The x-intercept, that's\\nwhere the graph intersects the horizontal axis, which is often referred to as the x-axis. Or another way to think about it, that tells us, that\\nsays, what is the x-value when our vertical value, our\\ny-value, is equal to zero? And our y-value is the money owed. So it says, hey how much\\ntime has passed when we owe, when we don't owe any more money or when Flynn doesn't owe\\nany more money to his sister? Well that's exactly\\nwhat they're asking for. How long did it take Flynn\\nto pay back the loan? And that's what that x-intercept tells us. It took him four weeks. After four weeks, he\\ndidn't owe any more money to his sister. So I like this choice,\\nbut let's just review the other ones. The y-intercept, well\\nthat's where the graph intersects the y-axis right over there. This tells us what's going\\non at time t equals zero. At time t equal zero or time equal zero, when the horizontal\\nvariable is equal to zero, we see that Flynn owes $20. So this one isn't valuable\\nfor figuring out when he, how long it takes to pay it back. This one is useful for figuring out how much did he owe initially. So we'll rule that one out. And we already picked one choice, so we can rule out none of the above. \",\n",
       " '4.5.3': \"- [Instructor] We're told\\nthat Felipe feeds his dog the same amount every day\\nfrom a large bag of dog food. Two weeks after initially opening the bag, he decided to start weighing\\nhow much food remained in the bag on a weekly basis. Here's some of his data. So we see after 14 days,\\nthere's 14 kilograms remaining. Then after another seven days pass by, so now we're at 21 days\\nfrom the beginning, there's only 10.5 kilograms left. Then after 28 days there\\nare seven kilograms left. All right, so we are going\\nto try to use this data to start answering some\\ninteresting questions, and maybe we'll also try to\\nvisualize it with a graph. So the first thing that\\nwe might try to tackle is well how much food was\\nin the bag to begin with if we assume that he's using the same amount of food every week. So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. How much food was in the bag to begin with if we assume that Felipe\\nis feeding his dog the same amount every week? Okay now there's several ways to do this, but to help us visualize this, let me see if I can graph\\nthe data that we have and then see what would happen\\nas we approach the beginning of this, of what's going\\non here, the dog feeding, and maybe as we go to the end as well. So let's see, this is my\\nx-axis, this is my y-axis. I'm going to make x-axis\\nmeasure the passage of the days, so number of days on the x-axis. And on the y-axis I'm going to measure, I'm gonna measure food remaining,\\nand that is in kilograms. And let's see, it looks like\\nmaybe if my scale goes up to, let's make this five, 10, 15, 20, and then 25, I can make\\nit a little higher, 25, I think this will be sufficient. And then we wanna go up to 28 days, and it looks like they're\\nmeasuring everything on a weekly basis, so let's say that this is seven, 14, 21, and then 28. And they gave us some data points. So after 14 days, there's\\n14 kilograms remaining, so 14 days, there's 14\\nkilograms remaining, right over there. After 21 days, there's\\n10.5 kilograms remaining, 21 days, 10.5 is right about there. After 28 days there's\\nseven kilograms remaining, so after 28 days, seven kilograms. And we're assuming the rate of the dog food usage is the same, that he's feeding his dog\\nthe same amount every week. And so this would describe a line, that the rate is going to\\nbe the slope of that line, and then if we can plot this line, if we know where that line\\nintersects the x and y-axes, we might be able to figure\\nout some other things. So actually let me draw a line here, let me see if I can use\\nthis little line tool to connect the dots in a reasonable way. So let's say it looks something\\nlike that, that's our line, that'll describe how quickly\\nhe is using his dog food. So let me make sure that this dot is, should be on the line as well. Now let's try to answer\\nthat first question, and think about how we might do it. How much food was in\\nthe bag to begin with? So what point here\\nrepresents how much food was in the bag to begin with? Well that's the amount of\\nfood remaining at day zero, at the beginning of this, so that would be this\\npoint right over here, would describe how much food\\nwas in the bag to begin with. This would be the y-intercept,\\ny-intercept is when our x value is equal to\\nzero, what is our y value. And when we just look at it, the graph, it looks like it's a little bit over 20, but we could find the exact value by thinking about the slope,\\nwhich is thinking about the rate at which the dog\\nfood is being depleted. We can see that every week,\\nevery week that goes by, or every seven days that goes by, it looks like we use 3.5 kilograms. Or another way to think about it, every two weeks it looks like\\nwe use an entire kilogram. So let me put it this way, when we go plus 14 days, plus 14 days, it looks like we use up, or the\\nfood remaining goes does by, goes down every two weeks it\\ngoes down by seven kilograms, seven kilograms, negative seven kilograms. So if we wanna figure\\nout this exact value, we just have to reverse things. If we are going back 14 days, then we are going to\\ngo up seven kilograms. So if we were at 14, up seven kilograms, this right over here is\\nthe point zero comma 21. So how much food did Felipe\\nstart with in the bag? 21 kilograms, and we got\\nthat from the y-intercept. Now another question is how much is Felipe feeding his dog everyday. Pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. Well we know every 14 days he's feeding the dog seven kilograms, so one way to think about it is, and we're really looking at the slope here to figure out the rate at\\nwhich he's feeding his dog. So the slope is equal\\nto our change in the y, so negative seven kilograms, every our change in the x, every 14 days, and so seven over 14 is\\nthe same thing as 1/2, so this is equal to negative\\n1/2 of a kilogram per day. So this tells us everyday\\nthe food remaining is going down half a kilogram, so that means he's feeding his dog, assuming his dog is eating\\nthe food and finishing it, that his dog is eating\\nhalf a kilogram a day. And if we wanted to ask another question, how many days will the bag last? How would you think about that? And we know it's going\\nto be out here someplace, if we just continue that line, because this point right over here, where our line intersects the x-axis, that would be our x-intercept, that is the x value when\\nour y value is zero, and our y is the amount of food remaining. So we wanna know what day do\\nwe have no food remaining. And we could try to estimate it, or we could figure out it exactly. We know that every 14 days\\nwe use up seven kilograms. So if we are at seven, as\\nwe are right over here, and we go 14 days in the future, we should use up the\\nremaining contents of the bag, so plus 14 days we're going to use up the remaining seven kilograms. And so this should happen\\n14 days after the 28th day, so this is going to be the 42nd day. \",\n",
       " '4.5.4': \"- [Instructor] We're told\\nKaya rode her bicycle toward a tree at a constant speed. The table below shows the relationship between her distance to the tree and how many times her front tire rotated. So once her tire rotated four times, she was 22 1/2 meters from the tree. Then once she's rotated eight times, she's 12 1/2 meters from the tree. When it rotated 12 times, then she's only 2 1/2 meters to the tree. So she's getting closer and closer the more rotations that her tire has had. So then they ask us some questions here. So they ask us how far away\\nwas the tree to begin with? How far does Kaya travel\\nwith each rotation? How many rotations did it\\ntake to get to the tree? So like always, pause this video, and see if you can answer these questions on your own before we do it together. So let's start with the first question. How far away was the tree to begin with? So the way that I would think about it is, after four rotations, we're\\n22 1/2 meters from the tree. We see that if we increase\\nby another four rotations, so let's say plus four rotations, we see that we have gotten\\n10 meters closer to the tree, or our distance to the tree\\nhas gone down by 10 meters. So I'll write negative 10 meters here. If we want to figure out how\\nfar the tree was to begin with, we have to go back to zero rotations. So if we're going back by four, so we're subtracting\\nfour from the rotations. And if we're going at a constant rate, well, then we would add 10 meters. So we would add 10 meters. If we add four rotations,\\nwe get 10 meters closer. If we take away four rotations, to get us back to zero rotations, then we will go 10 meters further. So that would be at 32.5 meters. So 32.5 meters is how far the tree was to begin with when Kaya\\nhad zero rotations. The next question is\\nhow far does Kaya travel with each rotation? All right, well, we already\\nsaw that with four rotations, she's traveling 10 meters, so we could say 10 meters in four rotations. So if we divide both of these\\nby four, what would we get? Well, that's the same thing as\\n2 1/2 meters in one rotation. So this is 2.5 meters. And last but not least, how many rotations did it\\ntake to get to the tree? Well, we know that after 12 rotations, she's only 2 1/2 meters\\naway from the tree. We also know that in every one rotation, she gets 2 1/2 meters closer. So she only needs one more rotation to cover this next 2 1/2 meters. So, if we go plus one rotations, we're going to go down 2 1/2 meters. We're going to go 2 1/2\\nmeters closer to the tree, and we will be at the tree. So how many rotations did it take to get to the tree in total? 13 rotations. Now one thing that's\\ninteresting is to think about what we just did in a graphical context that you might have seen before. And if we were to put on the\\nhorizontal axis rotations and if we were to put on the vertical axis distance to the tree, distance to tree, I'll just call the\\nvertical axis the y-axis and the horizontal axis the x-axis, well, we could see here\\nthat we have zero, four, eight, 12, I could go to 16. And then we saw that at zero rotations, we are 32.5 meters from the tree, so 32.5. This is all going to be in meters. So this first question was\\nreally another way of asking what is our y-intercept? And this next question, how far does Kaya travel\\nwith each rotation, well, we saw that when you\\nincrease your rotations by four, your distance to the tree\\ngoes down by 10 meters. So when this is plus four, we went down, we went down 10 meters. So it's negative 10 meters. So really what we were thinking\\nabout right here, this is, you could think about the\\nmagnitude of the slope. The slope of this line, the slope of this line that\\nwould describe her distance to the tree as based on\\nthe number of rotations, the slope is going to be\\nour change in our distance, which is negative 10, four, our change in rotations, over four. So the slope of this line is negative 2.5 meters per rotation. But when they say how far does Kaya travel with each rotation, she's\\ngetting 2 1/2 meters closer. Her distance from the tree\\ngoes down by 2 1/2 meters. And this last question, how many rotations did it\\ntake to get to the tree, well, at what point is our y value, our distance to the tree, zero? And we saw that it is at 13 rotations. So this is another way of thinking about what was the x-intercept? So the line, it's a line because we\\nknow that she's traveling at a constant rate, looks\\nsomething like that. So they really were\\nasking us the y-intercept, the slope, and the x-intercept. \",\n",

       " '5.1.1': \"- [Voiceover] There's\\na lot of different ways that you could represent\\na linear equation. So for example, if you\\nhad the linear equation y is equal to 2x plus three, that's one way to represent it, but I could represent this in\\nan infinite number of ways. I could, let's see, I could subtract 2x from both sides, I could write this as negative 2x plus y is equal to three. I could manipulate it in\\nways where I get it to, and I'm gonna do it right now, but this is another way of\\nwriting that same thing. y minus five is equal to\\ntwo times x minus one. You could actually simplify this and you could get either\\nthis equation here or that equation up on top. These are all equivalent,\\nyou can get from one to the other with logical\\nalgebraic operations. So there's an infinite number of ways to represent a given linear equation, but I what I wanna focus on in this video is this representation in particular, because this one is a\\nvery useful representation of a linear equation and\\nwe'll see in future videos, this one and this one can also be useful, depending on what you are looking for, but we're gonna focus on this one, and this one right over\\nhere is often called slope-intercept form. Slope-intercept form. And hopefully in a few minutes, it will be obvious why it\\ncalled slop-intercept form. And before I explain that\\nto you, let's just try to graph this thing. I'm gonna try to graph it, I'm just gonna plot some points here, so x comma y, and I'm\\ngonna pick some x values where it's easy to calculate the y values. So maybe the easiest is\\nif x is equal to zero. If x is equal to zero, then\\ntwo times zero is zero, that term goes away, and\\nyou're only left with this term right over here, y is equal to three. Y is equal to three. And so if we were to plot this. Actually let me start plotting it, so that is my y axis, and let me do the x axis, so that can be my x, oh that's not as straight as I would like it. So that looks pretty good, alright. That is my x axis and let me mark off some hash marks here,\\nso this is x equals one, x equals two, x equals three, this is y equals one, y equals two, y equals three, and obviously I could keep going and keep going, this would be\\ny is equal to negative one, this would be x is equal to negative one, negative two, negative three, so on and so forth. So this point right over\\nhere, zero comma three, this is x is zero, y is three. Well, the point that represents\\nwhen x is equal to zero and y equals three, this is, we're right on the y axis. If they have a line going\\nthrough it and this line contains this point, this is\\ngoing to be the y- intercept. So one way to think about it,\\nthe reason why this is called slope-intercept form is it's very easy to calculate the y-intercept. The y-intercept here is going to happen when it's written in this form, it's going to happen\\nwhen x is equal to zero and y is equal to three, it's gonna be this point right over here. So it's very easy to\\nfigure out the intercept, the y-intercept from this form. Now you might be saying, well it says slope-intercept form, it must also be easy to figure out the slope from this form. And if you made that conclusion, you would be correct! And we're about to see\\nthat in a few seconds. So let's plot some more points here and I'm just gonna keep\\nincreasing x by one. So if you increase x by\\none, so we could write that our delta x, our change\\nin x, delta Greek letter, this triangle is a Greek letter, delta, represents change in. Change in x here is one. We just increased x by\\none, what's gonna be our corresponding change in y? What's going to be our change in y? So let's see, when x is equal to one, we have two times one, plus three is going to be five. So our change in y is going to be two. Let's do that again. Let's increase our x by one. Change in x is equal to one. So then if we're gonna increase by one, we're gonna go from x equals one to x equals two. Well what's our corresponding change in y? Well when x is equal to two, two times two is four,\\nplus three is seven. Well our change in y, our\\nchange in y is equal to two. Went from five- when x went from one to two, y went from five to seven. So for every one that we increase x, y is increasing by two. So for this linear\\nequation, our change in y over change in x is always going to be, our change in y is two when\\nour change in x is one, or it's equal to two, or we could say that our\\nslope is equal to two. Well let's just graph this to make sure that we understand this. So when x equals one, y is equal to five. And actually we're gonna\\nhave to graph five up here. So when x is equal to one, y is equal to, and actually this is a little bit higher, this, let me clean this up a little bit. So this one would be, erase that a little bit. Just like that. So that's y is equal to four, and this is y is equal to five. So when x is one, y is equal to five, so it's that point right over there. So our line is going to look- you only need two points to define a line, our line is going to like, let me do this in this\\ncolor right over here. Our line is going to look like, is going to look, is going to look something like, is going to look, let me see if I can, I didn't draw it completely at scale, but it's going to look\\nsomething like this. This is the line, this is the line, y is equal to 2x plus three. But we already figured out\\nthat its slope is equal to two, when our change in x is one, when our change in x is\\none, our change in y is two. If our change in x was negative one, if our change in x was negative one, our change in y is negative two. And you can see that,\\nif from zero we went, we went down one, if we\\nwent to negative one, then what's our y going to be? Two times negative one is negative two plus three is one. So we see that, the point\\nnegative one comma one is on the line as well. So the slope here, our\\nchange in y over change in x, if we're going from between any two points on this line, is always going to be two. But where do you see two\\nin this original equation? Well you see the two right over here. And when you write something\\nin slop-intercept form, where you explicitly solve for y, y is equal to some constant\\ntimes x to the first power plus some other constant,\\nthe second one is going to be your intercept, your y-intercept, or it's going to be a way to\\nfigure out the y-intercept, the intercept itself is this\\npoint, the point at which the line intercepts the y axis, and then this two is going\\nto represent your slope. And that makes sense because\\nevery time you increase x by one, you're gonna\\nmultiply that by two, so you're gonna increase y by two. So this is just a, kinda\\nof a get your feet wet with the idea of slope-intercept form, but you'll see, at least for\\nme, this is the easiest form for me to think about what the graph of something looks like, because if you were given another, if you were given another linear equation, let's say y is equal to negative x, negative x plus two. Well immediately you say, okay look, my yintercept is going to be the point zero comma two, so I'm\\ngonna intersect the y axis right at that point, and\\nthen I have a slope of, the coefficient here is\\nreally just negative one, so I have a slope of negative one. So as we increase x by one, we're gonna decrease y by one. Increase x by one, you're\\ngonna decrease y by one. If you increase x by two,\\nyou're gonna decrease y by two. And so our line is gonna\\nlook something like this. Let me see if I can draw\\nit relatively neatly. It's going to look something, I think I can do a little\\nbit better than that. It's 'cus my graph paper is hand drawn. It's not ideal, but I think you get, you get the point. It's gonna look something like that. So from slope-intercept form, very easy to figure out\\nwhat the y-intercept is, and very easy to figure out the slope. The slope here, slope\\nhere is negative one. That's this negative one right over here, and the y-intercept, y-intercept is the point zero comma two, very easy to figure out 'cus essentially that gave you the information right there. \",\n",
       " '5.1.2': \"- [Instructor] What I'd\\nlike to do in this video is a few more examples recognizing the slope and\\ny-intercept given an equation. So, let's start with something that we might already recognize. Let's say we have something of the form y is equal to five x plus three. What is the slope and the\\ny-intercept in this example here? Well, we've already talked about that we can have something\\nin slope intercept form where it has a form y\\nis equal to the slope, which people use the letter m for, the slope times x plus the y-intercept, which people use the letter b for. So, if we just look at this, m is going to be the coefficient\\non x right over there. So, m is equal to five. That is the slope. And b is just going to be this\\nconstant term, plus three. So, b is equal to three. So, this is your y-intercept. So, that's pretty straightforward but let's see a few slightly\\nmore involved examples. Let's say if we had\\nform y is equal to five plus three x, what is the slope and the\\ny-intercept in this situation? Well, it might have\\ntaken you a second or two to realize how this earlier equation is different than the one I just wrote. Here, it's not five x, it's just five, and this isn't three, it's three x. So, if you wanna write it in the same form as we have up there, you can just swap the\\nfive and the three x. It doesn't matter which one comes first, you're just adding the two, so you can rewrite it as y is\\nequal to three x plus five. And then it becomes a little bit clear that our slope is three, the\\ncoefficient on the x term, and our y-intercept is five, y-intercept. Let's do another example. Let's say that we have the equation y is equal to 12 minus x. Pause this video and see if\\nyou can determine the slope and the y-intercept. All right, so, something\\nsimilar is going on here that we had over here. The standard form, slope intercept form, we're used to seeing the x\\nterm before the constant term, so we might wanna do that over here. So, we could rewrite this as y is equal to negative x plus 12, negative x plus 12. And so, from this, you\\nmight immediately recognize, okay, my constant term, when it's in this form, that's my b, that is my y-intercept. So, that's my y-intercept\\nright over there. But what's my slope? Well, the slope is the\\ncoefficient on the x term but all you see is a negative\\nhere, what's the coefficient? Well, you can view negative x as the same thing as negative one x. So, your slope here is\\ngoing to be negative one. Let's do another example. Let's say that we had the\\nequation y is equal to five x. What's the slope and y-intercept there? At first, you might say, hey, this looks nothing\\nlike what we have up here. I only have one term on the right-hand side\\nof the equality sign. Here, I have two. But you could just view\\nthis as five x plus zero, and then it might jump out at you that our y-intercept is zero and our slope is a\\ncoefficient on the x term. It is equal to five. Let's do one more example. Let's say we had y is\\nequal to negative seven, what's the slope and y-intercept there? Well, once again, you might say, hey, this doesn't look\\nlike what we had up here, how do we figure out the\\nslope or the y-intercept? Well, we could do a similar idea. We could say, hey, this is the same thing as y is equal to zero times x minus seven. And so now, it looks just\\nlike what we have over here and you might recognize that our y-intercept is negative seven, y-intercept is equal to negative seven. And our slope is a\\ncoefficient on the x term, it is equal to zero. And that makes sense. For a given change in x, you\\nwould expect zero change in y 'cause y is always negative\\nseven in this situation. \",\n",
       " '5.1.3': \"- [Sal] Let's do some practice examples from our intro to slope\\ny intercept exercise. What is the slope of y is equal to negative four x minus three? So you might already recognize, this is in slope intercept form. Just as a reminder,\\nslope intercept form is y is equal to mx plus b, where the coefficient on\\nthis x term right over here, that is our slope, and then this constant right over here, that is going to give\\nyou your y intercept. So if they're saying,\\nwhat is the slope here? Well I just need to figure out, what is the coefficient on this x term? And you can see that the coefficient here is a negative four. So that is going to be our m, that is going to be our slope. Now just as a reminder,\\nyou have to make sure that it's solved in this way, that is is solved for y, y is equal to something\\ntimes x minus three, so that's our slope. Let's do another one of these. So we're asked, what is the y intercept of y is equal to negative\\nthree x minus two? So once again we already have\\nit in slope intercept form. It's already been solved for y. It's of the form y is equal to mx plus b, where m, our slope, is\\ngiven right over here, negative three. But they're not asking for our slope, they're asking for the y intercept. Well the y intercept is given by b here, so b is negative two. Pay close attention to the sign here. So b is equal to negative two. But when I look at these choices, I don't see a b is equal to negative two, so what are they talking about? Well a y intercept is, what is the y value\\nwhen x is equal to zero? And you could see that here, if x was equal to zero\\nthen that term goes away and y is equal to b. So if you want to know the point where the graph described by this equation intercepts the y axis, well it's going to be what\\nis y when x is equal to zero? Well when x is equal to zero,\\ny is equal to negative two. And you could see that in\\nour original equation, again. If x were zero, this term would go away, and y would be equal to negative two. So zero, comma, negative two. So it would be that\\nchoice right over there. On Khan Academy obviously you\\njust have to click on that, you don't have to shade it in. Let's do one more. Complete the equation of the\\nline whose slope is five, and y intercept is zero, comma, four. So once again the general form is y is equal to our slope times x, if I want to put it in\\nslope intercept form, plus our y intercept. Well they're telling\\nus, our slope is five. Whose slope is five. So we know that m is going to be five. And they tell us that the\\ny intercept is zero, four. So the y intercept, b,\\nthat is the value of y when x is equal to zero. So the value of y when x equals zero is this four right over here. So that is going to be four. So I could say y is equal to five times x plus four. And when you're actually\\nentering it on Khan Academy, you would just type it in, or if you're using the app you would use it with your finger. And I always make the\\nmistake of writing y equals, and I type in y equals five x plus four. Notice they already gave you\\nthe y equals right over there. That's all you have to do, recognize the slope, the y intercept, and then remember what the slope\\nintercept form actually is. \",\n",
       " '5.1.4': \"- [Instructor] When Quinn\\nreturned from vacation, he turned the heat back on in his home. He set the temperature\\nas high as it could go. Q represents the\\ntemperature in Quinn's home in degrees Celsius after t minutes. This Q is equal to 15 plus 0.4t. What was the temperature when\\nQuinn returned from vacation? So pause this video and see if you can work\\nthis out on your own. All right, so they wanna\\nknow the temperature and you might get a little confused, hey maybe t is for temperature. No, t is time in minutes. Temperature is Q. Q represents the temperature. So they really wanna know is, what was Q when Quinn\\nreturned from vacation? Well, right when Quinn\\nreturned from vacation, that is when t is equal to zero. So this is equivalent to saying, what is Q, our temperature,\\nwhen zero minutes have elapsed? Well, if you go back to\\nthis original equation, we see that Q is equal to 15 plus 0.4 times the amount\\nof elapsed time in minutes. So that's times zero. So that's just going to\\nbe 15 degrees Celsius. If you're familiar with\\nslope intercept form, you could think of it as our temperature is equal to 0.4 times\\nthe elapsed time plus 15. So t equals zero, you're\\nleft with just this term which in many cases we\\nview as our y-intercept. What is going on right when\\nwe're just getting started? Right when our horizontal\\nvariable is equal to zero. And our horizontal variable in this situation is elapsed time. How much do the temperature\\nincrease every minute? There's a couple of ways\\nyou can think about this. One if you recognize, this\\nis slope intercept form. You could see that 0.4 is the slope. So that says for every one minute change in time, you're going to have an\\nincrease in temperature by 0.4 degrees Celsius. So you could do it that way. You could try out some values. You could say, all\\nright, let me think about what Q is going to be based on t. So time, t equals zero\\nright when you got home. We're to figure out that the temperature\\nis 15 degrees Celsius. At t equals one, what happens? It's going to be 15 plus 0.4 times one. That's just gonna be 15.4. Notice, when we increased our time by one, our temperature increased\\nby 0.4 degrees Celsius by the slope. And what happened again\\nif we increased time by another minute, if\\nwe go from one to two, we would get two, 15.8. We would increase\\ntemperature by another 0.4. How much will the temperature increase if Quinn leaves the\\nheat on for 20 minutes? Pause the video and see\\nif you can solve that. All right, now we have to be careful here. They're not asking us what is the temperature after 20 minutes. They're saying, how much\\nwill the temperature increase if he leaves the heat on for 20 minutes? If we just wanna know\\nwhat is the temperature after 20 minutes, we would just say, okay, what is Q when t is equal to 20? So it'd be 15 plus 0.4 times 20. 0.4 times 20 is eight. Eight plus 15 is 23. So it's 23 degrees\\nCelsius after 20 minutes. But that's not what they're asking us. They're asking, how much will\\nthe temperature increase? Well, where did we start from? We started from 15 degrees Celsius and now after 20 minutes we\\nhave gone to 23 degrees Celsius. So we have increased by\\neight degrees Celsius. Or, another way to think about it, we have increased by this\\namount right over here. We started at 15 and after 20 minutes, we have increased by 0.4 times 20 which is eight degrees Celsius. We're done! \",\n",
       " '5.2.1': \"We are asked to graph y is\\nequal to 1/3x minus 2. Now, whenever you see an\\nequation in this form, this is called slope-intercept form. And the general way of writing\\nit is y is equal to mx plus b, where m is the slope. And here in this case, m is\\nequal to 1/3-- so let me write that down-- m is equal to 1/3,\\nand b is the y-intercept. So in this case, b is\\nequal to negative 2. And you know that b is the\\ny-intercept, because we know that the y-intercept occurs\\nwhen x is equal to 0. So if x is equal to 0 in either\\nof these situations, this term just becomes 0 and\\ny will be equal to b. So that's what we mean by\\nb is the y-intercept. So whenever you look at an\\nequation in this form, it's actually fairly straightforward to graph this line. b is the y-intercept. In this case it is negative 2,\\nso that means that this line must intersect the y-axis at y\\nis equal to negative 2, so it's this point right here. Negative 1, negative 2, this\\nis the point 0, negative 2. If you don't believe me, there's\\nnothing magical about this, try evaluating or\\ntry solving for y when x is equal to 0. When x is equal to 0, this term\\ncancels out and you're just left with y is equal\\nto negative 2. So that's the y-intercept\\nright there. Now, this 1/3 tells us the\\nslope of the line. How much do we change in\\ny for any change in x? So this tells us that\\n1/3, so that right there, is the slope. So it tells us that 1/3 is equal\\nto the change in y over the change in x. Or another way to think about\\nit, if x changes by 3, then y would change by 1. So let me graph that. So we know that this point is\\non the graph, that's the y-intercept. The slope tells us that if x\\nchanges by 3-- so let me go 3 three to the right, 1, 2, 3--\\nthat y will change by 1. So this must also be a\\npoint on the graph. And we could keep doing that. If x changes by 3,\\ny changes by 1. If x goes down by 3, y\\nwill go down by 1. If x goes down by 6, y\\nwill go down by 2. It's that same ratio, so\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2. And you can see all of these\\npoints are on the line, and the line is the graph of\\nthis equation up here. So let me graph it. So it'll look something\\nlike that. And you're done. \",\n",
       " '5.3.1': \"So you may or may not already\\nknow that any linear equation can be written in the form\\ny is equal to mx plus b. Where m is the slope\\nof the line. The same slope that we've\\nbeen dealing with the last few videos. The rise over run of the line. Or the inclination\\nof the line. And b is the y-intercept. I think it's pretty easy\\nto verify that b is a y-intercept. The way you verify that is you\\nsubstitute x is equal to 0. If you get x is equal to 0--\\nremember x is equal to 0, that means that's where we're going\\nto intercept at the y-axis. If x is equal to 0, this\\nequation becomes y is equal to m times 0 plus b. m times 0 is just\\ngoing to be 0. I don't care what m is. So then y is going\\nto be equal to b. So the point 0, b is going\\nto be on that line. The line will intercept the\\ny-axis at the point y is equal to b. We'll see that with\\nactual numbers in the next few videos. Just to verify for you that m\\nis really the slope, let's just try some numbers out. We know the point 0,\\nb is on the line. What happens when\\nx is equal to 1? You get y is equal\\nto m times 1. Or it's equal to m plus b. So we also know that the\\npoint 1, m plus b is also on the line. Right? This is just the y value. So what's the slope between\\nthat point and that point? Let's take this as the end\\npoint, so you have m plus b, our change in y, m plus b minus\\nb over our change in x, over 1 minus 0. This is our change in\\ny over change in x. We're using two points. That's our end point. That's our starting point. So if you simplify this,\\nb minus b is 0. 1 minus 0 is 1. So you get m/1, or you\\nget it's equal to m. So hopefully you're satisfied\\nand hopefully I didn't confuse you by stating it in the\\nabstract with all of these variables here. But this is definitely going\\nto be the slope and this is definitely going to be\\nthe y-intercept. Now given that, what I want to\\ndo in this exercise is look at these graphs and then use the\\nalready drawn graphs to figure out the equation. So we're going to look at these,\\nfigure out the slopes, figure out the y-intercepts and\\nthen know the equation. So let's do this line A first.\\nSo what is A's slope? Let's start at some\\narbitrary point. Let's start right over there. We want to get even numbers. If we run one, two, three. So if delta x is equal to 3. Right? One, two, three. Our delta y-- and I'm just doing\\nit because I want to hit an even number here-- our delta\\ny is equal to-- we go down by 2-- it's equal\\nto negative 2. So for A, change in\\ny for change in x. When our change in x is 3, our\\nchange in y is negative 2. So our slope is negative 2/3. When we go over by 3, we're\\ngoing to go down by 2. Or if we go over by 1, we're\\ngoing to go down by 2/3. You can't exactly see it there,\\nbut you definitely see it when you go over by 3. So that's our slope. We've essentially done\\nhalf of that problem. Now we have to figure\\nout the y-intercept. So that right there is our m. Now what is our b? Our y-intercept. Well where does this intersect\\nthe y-axis? Well we already said\\nthe slope is 2/3. So this is the point\\ny is equal to 2. When we go over by 1 to the\\nright, we would have gone down by 2/3. So this right here must\\nbe the point 1 1/3. Or another way to say it,\\nwe could say it's 4/3. That's the point y\\nis equal to 4/3. Right there. A little bit more than 1. About 1 1/3. So we could say b\\nis equal to 4/3. So we'll know that the equation\\nis y is equal to m, negative 2/3, x plus\\nb, plus 4/3. That's equation A. Let's do equation B. Hopefully we won't have\\nto deal with as many fractions here. Equation B. Let's figure out its slope\\nfirst. Let's start at some reasonable point. We could start at that point. Let me do it right here. B. Equation B. When our delta x is equal\\nto-- let me write it this way, delta x. So our delta x could be 1. When we move over 1 to the\\nright, what happens to our delta y? We go up by 3. delta x. delta y. Our change in y is 3. So delta y over delta x, When\\nwe go to the right, our change in x is 1. Our change in y is positive 3. So our slope is equal to 3. What is our y-intercept? Well, when x is equal to\\n0, y is equal to 1. So b is equal to 1. So this was a lot easier. Here the equation is y is\\nequal to 3x plus 1. Let's do that last line there. Line C Let's do the y-intercept\\nfirst. You see immediately the y-intercept--\\nwhen x is equal to 0, y is negative 2. So b is equal to negative 2. And then what is the slope? m is equal to change in\\ny over change in x. Let's start at that\\ny-intercept. If we go over to the right\\nby one, two, three, four. So our change in x\\nis equal to 4. What is our change in y? Our change in y is positive 2. So change in y is 2 when\\nchange in x is 4. So the slope is equal\\nto 1/2, 2/4. So the equation here is y is\\nequal to 1/2 x, that's our slope, minus 2. And we're done. Now let's go the other way. Let's look at some equations of\\nlines knowing that this is the slope and this is the\\ny-intercept-- that's the m, that's the b-- and actually\\ngraph them. Let's do this first line. I already started circling\\nit in orange. The y-intercept is 5. When x is equal to 0,\\ny is equal to 5. You can verify that\\non the equation. So when x is equal to 0, y is\\nequal to one, two, three, four, five. That's the y-intercept\\nand the slope is 2. That means when I move 1 in the\\nx-direction, I move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move 1 in the x-direction,\\nI move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move 1 in the x-direction,\\nI move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move back 1 in the\\nx-direction, I move down 2 in the y-direction. If I move back 1 in the\\nx-direction, I move down 2 in the y-direction. I keep doing that. So this line is going to look--\\nI can't draw lines too neatly, but this is going\\nto be my best shot. It's going to look something\\nlike that. It'll just keep going on,\\non and on and on. So that's our first line. I can just keep going\\ndown like that. Let's do this second line. y is equal to negative\\n0.2x plus 7. Let me write that. y is equal\\nto negative 0.2x plus 7. It's always easier to\\nthink in fractions. So 0.2 is the same\\nthing as 1/5. We could write y is equal to\\nnegative 1/5 x plus 7. We know it's y-intercept at 7. So it's one, two, three,\\nfour, five, six. That's our y-intercept\\nwhen x is equal to 0. This tells us that for every\\n5 we move to the right, we move down 1. We can view this as\\nnegative 1/5. The delta y over delta x is\\nequal to negative 1/5. For every 5 we move to the\\nright, we move down 1. So every 5. One, two, three, four, five. We moved 5 to the right. That means we must\\nmove down 1. We move 5 to the right. One, two, three, four, five. We must move down 1. If you go backwards, if you move\\n5 backwards-- instead of this, if you view this\\nas 1 over negative 5. These are obviously equivalent\\nnumbers. If you go back 5-- that's\\nnegative 5. One, two, three, four, five. Then you move up 1. If you go back 5-- one,\\ntwo, three, four, five-- you move up 1. So the line is going\\nto look like this. I have to just connect\\nthe dots. I think you get the idea. I just have to connect\\nthose dots. I could've drawn it a little\\nbit straighter. Now let's do this one, y\\nis equal to negative x. Where's the b term? I don't see any b term. You remember we're saying\\ny is equal to mx plus b. Where is the b? Well, the b is 0. You could view this as plus 0. Here is b is 0. When x is 0, y is 0. That's our y-intercept, right\\nthere at the origin. And then the slope-- once again\\nyou see a negative sign. You could view that as\\nnegative 1x plus 0. So slope is negative 1. When you move to the right by\\n1, when change in x is 1, change in y is negative 1. When you move up by 1 in x,\\nyou go down by 1 in y. Or if you go down by 1 in x,\\nyou're going to go up by 1 in y. x and y are going to\\nhave opposite signs. They go in opposite\\ndirections. So the line is going\\nto look like that. You could almost imagine it's\\nsplitting the second and fourth quadrants. Now I'll do one more. Let's do this last\\none right here. y is equal to 3.75. Now you're saying, gee,\\nwe're looking for y is equal to mx plus b. Where is this x term? It's completely gone. Well the reality here is, this\\ncould be rewritten as y is equal to 0x plus 3.75. Now it makes sense. The slope is 0. No matter how much we change\\nour x, y does not change. Delta y over delta\\nx is equal to 0. I don't care how much\\nyou change your x. Our y-intercept is 3.75. So 1, 2, 3.75 is right\\naround there. You want to get close. 3 3/4. As I change x, y will\\nnot change. y is always going to be 3.75. It's just going to be\\na horizontal line at y is equal to 3.75. Anyway, hopefully you\\nfound this useful. \",\n",
       " '5.3.2': \"A line has a slope of negative\\n3/4 and goes through the point 0 comma 8. What is the equation of this\\nline in slope-intercept form? So any line can be represented\\nin slope-intercept form, is y is equal to mx plus b,\\nwhere this m right over here, that is of the\\nslope of the line. And this b over here, this is\\nthe y-intercept of the line. Let me draw a quick\\nline here just so that we can visualize\\nthat a little bit. So that is my y-axis. And then that is my x-axis. And let me draw a line. And since our line here\\nhas a negative slope, I'll draw a downward\\nsloping line. So let's say our line\\nlooks something like that. So hopefully, we're a little\\nfamiliar with the slope already. The slope essentially\\ntells us, look, start at some point\\non the line, and go to some other point\\nof the line, measure how much you had to move in the\\nx direction, that is your run, and then measure\\nhow much you had to move in the y direction,\\nthat is your rise. And our slope is equal\\nto rise over run. And you can see over here,\\nwe'd be downward sloping. Because if you move in\\nthe positive x direction, we have to go down. If our run is positive,\\nour rise here is negative. So this would be a\\nnegative over a positive, it would give you\\na negative number. That makes sense, because\\nwe're downward sloping. The more we go down\\nin this situation, for every step we\\nmove to the right, the more downward\\nsloping will be, the more of a negative\\nslope we'll have. So that's slope right over here. The y-intercept just tells us\\nwhere we intercept the y-axis. So the y-intercept, this\\npoint right over here, this is where the line\\nintersects with the y-axis. This will be the\\npoint 0 comma b. And this actually just falls\\nstraight out of this equation. When x is equal to\\n0-- so let's evaluate this equation, when\\nx is equal to 0. y will be equal to\\nm times 0 plus b. Well, anything times 0 is 0. So y is equal to 0\\nplus b, or y will be equal to b, when\\nx is equal to 0. So this is the point 0 comma b. Now, they tell us what\\nthe slope of this line is. They tell us a line has\\na slope of negative 3/4. So we know that our\\nslope is negative 3/4, and they tell us that the\\nline goes through the point 0 comma 8. They tell us we go through the--\\nLet me just, in a new color. I've already used orange,\\nlet me use this green color. They tell us what we go\\nthrough the point 0 comma 8. Notice, x is 0. So we're on the y-axis. When x is 0, we're\\non the y-axis. So this is our y-intercept. So b, we could say-- we could\\ndo a couple-- our y-intercept is the point 0 comma 8, or we\\ncould say that b-- Remember, it's also 0 comma b. We could say b is equal to 8. So we know m is equal to\\nnegative 3/4, b is equal to 8, so we can write the\\nequation of this line in slope-intercept form. It's y is equal to negative\\n3/4 times x plus b, plus 8. And we are done. \",\n",
       " '5.3.3': \"A line goes through the points (-1, 6) and (5, -4). What is the equation of the line? Let's just try to visualize this. So that is my x axis. And you don't have to draw it to do this problem but it always help to visualize That is my y axis. And the first point is (-1,6) So (-1, 6). So negative 1 coma, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 6. So it's this point, rigth over there, it's (-1, 6). And the other point is (5, -4). So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And we go down 4, So 1, 2, 3, 4 So it's right over there. So the line connects them will looks something like this. Line will draw a rough approximation. I can draw a straighter than that. I will draw a dotted line maybe Easier do dotted line. So the line will looks something like that. So let's find its equation. So good place to start is we can find its slope. Remember, we want, we can find the equation y is equal to mx plus b. This is the slope-intercept form where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. We can first try to solve for m. We can find the slope of this line. So m, or the slope is the change in y over the change in x. Or, we can view it as the y value of our end point minus the y value of our starting point over the x-value of our end point minus the x-value of our starting point. Let me make that clear. So this is equal to change in y over change in x wich is the same thing as rise over run wich is the same thing as the y-value of your ending point minus the y-value of your starting point. This is the same exact thing as change in y and that over the x value of your ending point minus the x-value of your starting point This is the exact same thing as change in x. And you just have to pick one of these as the starting point and one as the ending point. So let's just make this over here our starting point and make that our ending point. So what is our change in y? So our change in y, to go we started at y is equal to six, we started at y is equal to 6. And we go down all the way to y is equal to negative 4 So this is rigth here, that is our change in y You can look at the graph and say, oh, if I start at 6 and I go to negative 4 I went down 10. or if you just want to use this formula here it will give you the same thing We finished at negative 4, we finished at negative 4 and from that we want to subtract, we want to subtract 6. This right here is y2, our ending y and this is our beginning y This is y1. So y2, negative 4 minus y1, 6. or negative 4 minus 6. That is equal to negative 10. And all it does is tell us the change in y you go from this point to that point We have to go down, our rise is negative we have to go down 10. That's where the negative 10 comes from. Now we just have to find our change in x. So we can look at this graph over here. We started at x is equal to negative 1 and we go all the way to x is equal to 5. So we started at x is equal to negative 1, and we go all the way to x is equal to 5. So it takes us one to go to zero and then five more. So are change in x is 6. You can look at that visually there or you can use this formula same exact idea, our ending x-value, our ending x-value is 5 and our starting x-value is negative 1. 5 minus negative 1. 5 minus negative 1 is the same thing as 5 plus 1. So it is 6. So our slope here is negative 10 over 6. wich is the exact same thing as negative 5 thirds. as negative 5 over 3 I divided the numerator and the denominator by 2. So we now know our equation will be y is equal to negative 5 thirds, that's our slope, x plus b. So we still need to solve for y-intercept to get our equation. And to do that, we can use the information that we know in fact we have several points of information We can use the fact that the line goes through the point (-1,6) you could use the other point as well. We know that when is equal to negative 1, So y is eqaul to 6. So y is equal to six when x is equal to negative 1 So negative 5 thirds times x, when x is equal to negative 1 y is equal to 6. So we literally just substitute this x and y value back into this and know we can solve for b. So let's see, this negative 1 times negative 5 thirds. So we have 6 is equal to positive five thirds plus b. And now we can subtract 5 thirds from both sides of this equation. so we have subtracted the left hand side. From the left handside and subtracted from the rigth handside And then we get, what's 6 minus 5 thirds. So that's going to be, let me do it over here We take a common denominator. So 6 is the same thing as Let's do it over here. So 6 minus 5 over 3 is the same thing as 6 is the same thing as 18 over 3 minus 5 over 3 6 is 18 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3. And then of course, these cancel out. So we get b is equal to 13 thirds. So we are done. We know We know the slope and we know the y-intercept. The equation of our line is y is equal to negative 5 thirds x plus our y-intercept which is 13 which is 13 over 3. And we can write these as mixed numbers. if it's easier to visualize. 13 over 3 is four and 1 thirds. So this y-intercept right over here. this y-intercept right over here. That's 0 coma 13 over 3 or 0 coma 4 and 1 thirds. And even with my very roughly drawn diagram it those looks like this. And the slope negative 5 thirds that's the same thing as negative 1 and 2 thirds. You can see here the slope is downward because the slope is negative. It's a little bit steeper than a slope of 1. It's not quite a negative 2. It's negative 1 and 2 thirds. if you write this as a negative, as a mixed number. So, hopefully, you found that entertaining. \",\n",
       " '5.3.4': \"- [Instructor] Tara was\\nhiking up a mountain. She started her hike at an\\nelevation of 1,200 meters and ascended at a constant rate. After four hours, she reached\\nan elevation of 1,700 meters. Let y represent Tara's elevation\\nin meters after x hours. And they ask us, and this is from an exercise on Khan Academy, it says, complete the equation for the relationship between the elevation\\nand the number of hours. And if you're on Khan\\nAcademy, you would type it in, but we can do it by hand. So pause this video and\\nwork it out on some paper and let's see if we get to the same place. All right, now let's do this together. So first of all, they tell us that she's ascending at a constant rate. So that's a pretty good indication that we could describe her elevation based on the number of hours she travels with a linear equation. And we could even figure\\nout that constant rate. It says that she goes from 1,200 meters to 1,700 meters in four hours. So we could say her rate is going to be her change in elevation over a change in time. So her change in elevation is 1,700 meters minus 1,200 meters and she\\ndoes this over four hours. Over, her change in time is four hours. So her constant rate\\nin the numerator here, 1,700 minus 1,200 is 500 meters. She's able to go up 500\\nmeters in four hours. If we divide 500 by four, this is 125 meters per hour. And so we could use this now to think about what our equation would be. Our elevation y would be equal to, well, where is she starting? Well, it's starting at 1,200 meters. So she's starting at 1,200 meters. And then to that, we're going to add how much she climbs based on\\nhow many hours she's traveled. So it's going to be this rate, 125 meters per hour times the number of hours she has been hiking. So the number of hours is x times x. So this right over here is an equation for the relationship between the elevation and the number of hours. Another way you could\\nhave thought about it, you could have said, okay, this is going to be a linear equation because she's ascending\\nat a constant rate. You could say the slope intercept form for a linear equation is\\ny is equal to mx plus b, where b is your y-intercept. What is the value of y\\nwhen x is equal to zero? And you'd say, all right, when x is equal to zero, she's at an elevation of 1,200. And then m is our slope. So that's the rate at which\\nour elevation is increasing. And that's what we\\ncalculated right over here. Our slope is 125 meters per hour. So notice, these are equivalent. I just have, these two terms are swapped. So we could either write\\ny is equal to 1,200 plus 125x or you could write\\nit the other way around. You could write 125x plus 1,200. They are equivalent. \",\n",
       " '5.4.1': \"So what I've drawn here\\nin yellow is a line. And let's say we know two\\nthings about this line. We know that it\\nhas a slope of m, and we know that the point\\na, b is on this line. And so the question that we're\\ngoing to try to answer is, can we easily come\\nup with an equation for this line using\\nthis information? Well, let's try it out. So any point on this line,\\nor any x, y on this line, would have to\\nsatisfy the condition that the slope\\nbetween that point-- so let's say that this\\nis some point x, y. It's an arbitrary\\npoint on the line-- the fact that it's\\non the line tells us that the slope between a, b\\nand x, y must be equal to m. So let's use that knowledge to\\nactually construct an equation. So what is the slope\\nbetween a, b and x, y? Well, our change in y--\\nremember slope is just change in y over change in x. Let me write that. Slope is equal to change\\nin y over change in x. This little triangle character,\\nthat's the Greek letter Delta, shorthand for change in. Our change in y--\\nwell let's see. If we start at y is equal\\nto b, and if we end up at y equals this arbitrary\\ny right over here, this change in y right over\\nhere is going to be y minus b. Let me write it in\\nthose same colors. So this is going to be y\\nminus my little orange b. And that's going to be\\nover our change in x. And the exact same logic--\\nwe start at x equals a. We finish at x\\nequals this arbitrary x, whatever x we\\nhappen to be at. So that change in x is\\ngoing to be that ending point minus our starting\\npoint-- minus a. And we know this is the slope\\nbetween these two points. That's the slope between\\nany two points on this line. And that's going\\nto be equal to m. So this is going\\nto be equal to m. And so what we've\\nalready done here is actually create an equation\\nthat describes this line. It might not be in any form\\nthat you're used to seeing, but this is an\\nequation that describes any x, y that satisfies this\\nequation right over here will be on the line because\\nany x, y that satisfies this, the slope between that x, y\\nand this point right over here, between the point a, b,\\nis going to be equal to m. So let's actually now\\nconvert this into forms that we might\\nrecognize more easily. So let me paste that. So to simplify this expression\\na little bit, or at least to get rid of the x minus\\na in the denominator, let's multiply both\\nsides by x minus a. So if we multiply both sides\\nby x minus a-- so x minus a on the left-hand side and\\nx minus a on the right. Let me put some\\nparentheses around it. So we're going to multiply\\nboth sides by x minus a. The whole point of that is you\\nhave x minus a divided by x minus a, which is just\\ngoing to be equal to 1. And then on the\\nright-hand side, you just have m times x minus a. So this whole thing\\nhas simplified to y minus b is equal\\nto m times x minus a. And right here, this is\\na form that people, that mathematicians, have\\ncategorized as point-slope form. So this right over here\\nis the point-slope form of the equation that\\ndescribes this line. Now, why is it called\\npoint-slope form? Well, it's very easy to\\ninspect this and say, OK. Well look, this is the\\nslope of the line in green. That's the slope of the line. And I can put the two points in. If the point a, b\\nis on this line, I'll have the slope times x\\nminus a is equal to y minus b. Now, let's see\\nwhy this is useful or why people like to\\nuse this type of thing. Let's not use just a, b\\nand a slope of m anymore. Let's make this a little\\nbit more concrete. Let's say that someone tells you\\nthat I'm dealing with some line where the slope is equal\\nto 2, and let's say it goes through the\\npoint negative 7, 5. So very quickly, you\\ncould use this information and your knowledge\\nof point-slope form to write this in this form. You would just say,\\nwell, an equation that contains this point and has this\\nslope would be y minus b, which is 5-- y minus the\\ny-coordinate of the point that this line contains--\\nis equal to my slope times x minus the x-coordinate\\nthat this line contains. So x minus negative 7. And just like that, we have\\nwritten an equation that has a slope of 2\\nand that contains this point right over here. And if we don't like the x minus\\nnegative 7 right over here, we could obviously\\nrewrite that as x plus 7. But this is kind of the\\npurest point-slope form. If you want to simplify\\nit a little bit, you could write it as y minus\\n5 is equal to 2 times x plus 7. And if you want to see that this\\nis just one way of expressing the equation of this line--\\nthere are many others, and the one that we're\\nmost familiar with is y-intercept form--\\nthis can easily be converted to\\ny-intercept form. To do that, we just have\\nto distribute this 2. So we get y minus 5 is equal\\nto 2 times x plus 2 times 7, so that's equal to 14. And then we can get rid of\\nthis negative 5 on the left by adding 5 to both\\nsides of this equation. And then we are left with,\\non the left-hand side, y and, on the right-hand\\nside, 2x plus 19. So this right over here\\nis slope-intercept form. You have your slope\\nand your y-intercept. So this is slope-intercept form. And this right up here\\nis point-slope form. \",\n",
       " '5.4.2': \"- [Voiceover] Let's say\\nwe have a linear equation and we know when X is equal to four that Y is equal to nine and we've plotted that\\npoint here on our XY plane. Actually, I forgot to label\\nthe x-axis right over there. Now let's say we also know, we also know that when X is equal to six Y is equal to one. And we've plotted that point there. And so this green line\\nrepresents all of the solutions to this linear equation. Now what I want to do in this video is I want to say, well can we\\nfind that linear equation and can we express it\\nin both point-slope form and in slope-intercept form. And I encourage you, like always, pause the video and see if you can do it. So let's first think\\nabout point-slope form. Point, point-slope form. And point-slope form is\\nvery easy to generate if you know a point on the line, or if you know a point that satisfies, where the X and Y coordinates\\nsatisfy the linear equation, and if you were to know\\nthe slope of the line that represents the solution\\nset of that linear equation. Now for sure we actually\\nwere given two points that are solutions, that represent solutions to the linear equation. To fully apply point-slope, or\\nto apply point-slope easily, we just have to figure out the slope. And what we could do is,\\nwe could just evaluate well what's the slope between\\nthe two points that we know? And we just have to remind\\nourselves that slope, slope, is equal to, slope is equal to change\\nin y over change in x. Sometimes people say rise over run. And what's that going to be? Well, if we say that this\\nsecond point right over here, if we say this is kind of our, if we're starting at this\\npoint and we go to that point, then our change in Y, going\\nfrom this point to that point is going to be, it's going to be equal to one minus, one minus nine. One minus nine. This point right over here\\nis the point six comma one. So we started at Y equals nine, we finish at Y equals one, our change in Y is going\\nto be one minus nine. We have a negative eight change in Y, which makes sense. We've gone down eight. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be\\nequal to negative eight. That's our change in Y. And what's our change in X? Well we go from X equals\\nfour to X equals six. So we end up at X equals six and we started at X equals four. We started at X equals four, so our change in X is six minus four, which is equal to two. Which is equal to two. And you could have even done it visually. To go from this point to\\nthis point your change in Y, your change in Y is you went down eight. So your change in, let me write this. So your change in Y is\\nequal to negative eight. And what was your change in X? Again to get to this point? Well, your change in X is positive two. So your change in X is equal to two. And so what's your slope? Change in Y over change in X. Negative eight over two\\nis equal to negative four. So now that we have a, now that we know the slope and we know a point, we know a, we actually know two points on the line, we can express this in point-slope form. And so let's do that. And the way I like to\\nit is I always like to just take it straight from the\\ndefinition of what slope is. We know that the slope between\\nany two points on this line is going to be negative four. So if we take an arbitrary\\nY that sits on this line and if we find the difference\\nbetween that Y and, let's focus on this point up here. So if we find the difference between that Y and this Y, and nine, and it's over the difference between some X on the line and this X, and four. This is going to be the slope\\nbetween any XY on this line and this point right over here. And the slope between\\nany two points on a line are going to have to be constant. So this is going to be equal\\nto the slope of the line. It's going to be equal to negative four. And we're not in point-slope form or classic point-slope form just yet. To do that, we just multiply\\nboth sides times X minus four. So we get Y minus 9, we get Y minus nine is equal to our slope, negative four times X minus four. Time X minus four. And this right over here is our classic, this right over here is our\\nclassic point-slope form. We have the point, sometimes they even put\\nparenthesis like this, but we could figure out the point from this point-slope form. The point that sits on\\nthis line with things that make both sides of\\nthis equation equal to zero. So it would be X equals\\nfour, Y equals nine, which we have right up there, and then the slope is right over here, it's negative four. Now from this can we now express this linear equation in y-intercept form? And y-intercept form, just\\nas a bit of a reminder, it's Y is equal to MX plus B. Where this coefficient is our slope and this constant right over here allows us to figure out our y-intercept. And to get this in this\\nform we just have to simplify a little bit of this algebra. So you have Y minus nine. Y minus nine is equal to, well let's distribute this negative four. And I'll just switch some colors. Let's distribute this negative four. Negative four times X is negative four X. Negative four time\\nnegative four is plus 16. And now, if we just want to isolate the Y on the left hand side, we can add nine to both sides. So let's do that. Let's add nine, let's add nine to both sides. Let's add nine to both sides. On the left-hand side\\nwe're just left with Y. And on the right-hand side we're left with negative four X and then\\n16 plus nine is plus 25. And there you have it. We have the same linear\\nequation, but it's now represented in slope-intercept form. Once again, we see the\\nslope right over here and now we can figure out\\nwhat the y-intercept is. The y-intercept when X is equal to zero, Y is going to be equal to 25. My axis right here, I\\nhaven't drawn it high enough, but if I made it even taller\\nand taller and you see this line is gonna intersect the y-axis when Y is equal to, Y is equal to 25. So there you go, we wrote\\nit in point-slope form, that is that right over there, and we wrote it in Y, sorry, we wrote it in slope, we wrote it in slope-intercept form. Point-slope and slope-intercept. Hopefully you enjoyed that. \",\n",
       " '5.5.1': '- [Voiceover] We\\'ve already\\nlooked at several ways of writing linear equations. You could write it in\\nslope-intercept form, where it would be of the form\\nof Y is equal to MX plus B, where M and B are constants. M is the coefficient on\\nthis MX term right over here and M would represent the slope. And then from B you\\'re able to figure out the y-intercept. The Y, you\\'re able to figure out\\nthe y-intercept from this. Literally the graph that\\nrepresents the XY pairs that satisfy this equation, it would intersect the y-axis at the point X equals zero, Y is equal to B. And it\\'s slope would be M. We\\'ve already seen that multiple times. We\\'ve also seen that you can also express things in point-slope form. So let me make it clear. This is slope-intercept. Slope- intercept. And these are just different ways of writing the same equations. You can algebraically manipulate\\nfrom one to the other. Another way is point-slope. Point-slope form. And in point-slope form,\\nif you know that some, if you know that there\\'s\\nan equation where the line that represents the\\nsolutions of that equation has a slope M. Slope is equal to M. And if you know that X equals, X equals A, Y equals B, satisfies that equation, then in point-slope form you\\ncan express the equation as Y minus B is equal to M times X minus A. This is point-slope form\\nand we do videos on that. But what I really want\\nto get into in this video is another form. And it\\'s a form that you\\nmight have already seen. And that is standard form. Standard. Standard form. And standard form takes the shape of AX plus BY is equal to C, where A, B, and C are integers. And what I want to do in this video, like we\\'ve done in the ones on point-slope and slope-intercept is get an appreciation for what is standard form good at and what is standard form less good at? So let\\'s give a tangible example here. So let\\'s say I have the linear equation, it\\'s in standard form, 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72. And we wanted to graph this. So the thing that standard\\nform is really good for is figuring out, not just the y-intercept, y-intercept is pretty good if you\\'re using slope-intercept form, but we can find out the\\ny-intercept pretty clearly from standard form and the x-intercept. The x-intercept isn\\'t\\nso easy to figure out from these other forms right over here. So how do we do that? Well to figure out the x and y-intercepts, let\\'s just set up a little table here, X comma Y, and so the x-intercept is going to happen when Y is equal to zero. And the y-intercept is going to happen when X is equal to zero. So when Y is zero, what is X? So when Y is zero, 16 times zero is zero, that term disappears, and you\\'re left with 9X is equal to 72. So if nine times X is 72, 72 divided by nine is eight. So X would be equal to eight. So once again, that was\\npretty easy to figure out. This term goes away and\\nyou just have to say hey, nine times X is 72, X would be eight. When Y is equal to zero, X is eight. So the point, let\\'s see, Y is zero, X is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. That\\'s this point, that right over here. This point right over\\nhere is the x-intercept. When we talk about x-intercepts\\nwe\\'re referring to the point where the line actually\\nintersects the x-axis. Now what about the y-intercept? Well, we said X equals\\nzero, this disappears. And we\\'re left with 16Y is equal to 72. And so we could solve, we could solve that. So we could say, alright\\n16Y is equal to 72. And then divide both sides by 16. We get Y is equal to 72 over 16. And let\\'s see, what is that equal to? That is equal to, let\\'s see, they\\'re both divisible by eight, so that\\'s nine over two. Or we could say it\\'s 4.5. So when X is zero, Y is 4.5. And so, we could plot that point as well. X is zero, Y is one, two, three, 4.5. And just with these two\\npoints, two points are enough to graph a line, we can now graph it. So let\\'s do that. So let me, oops, though I was using the tool that would draw a straight line. Let me see if I can... So the line will look something like that. There you have it. I\\'ve just graphed, I\\'ve just graphed, this is the line that represents\\nall the X and Y pairs that satisfy the equation 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72. Now, I mentioned standard\\nform\\'s good at certain things and the good thing that standard form is, where it\\'s maybe somewhat unique relative to the other forms we looked at, is it\\'s very easy to\\nfigure out the x-intercept. It was very easy to\\nfigure out the x-intercept from standard form. And it wasn\\'t too hard to figure\\nout the y-intercept either. If we looked at slope-intercept form, the y-intercept just\\nkinda jumps out at you. At point-slope form, neither\\nthe x nor the y-intercept kind of jump out at you. The place where slope-intercept\\nor point-slope form are frankly better is\\nthat it\\'s pretty easy to pick out the slope here, while in standard form you would have to do a little bit of work. You could use these two points, you could use the x and y-intercepts as two points and figure\\nout the slope from there. So you can literally say,\\n\"Okay, if I\\'m going from \"this point to this point, my change in X \"to go from eight to\\nzero is negative eight. \"And to go from zero to 4.5,\" I wrote that little delta\\nthere unnecessarily. Let me. So when you go from eight to zero, your change in X is\\nequal to negative eight. And to go from zero to 4.5, your change in Y is going to be 4.5. So your slope, once you\\'ve figured this out, you could say, \"Okay, this is going to be \"change in Y, 4.5, over change in X, \"over negative 8.\" And since I, at least I\\ndon\\'t like a decimal up here, let\\'s multiply the numerator\\nand the denominator by two. You get negative nine over 16. Now once again, we had to do\\na little bit of work here. We either use these two points, it didn\\'t just jump\\nimmediately out of this, although you might see a\\nlittle bit of a pattern of what\\'s going on here. But you still have to think about is it negative? Is it positive? You have to do a little bit\\nof algebraic manipulation. Or, what I typically do if\\nI\\'m looking for the slope, I actually might put this into, into one of the other forms. Especially slope-intercept form. But standard form by itself, great for figuring out\\nboth the x and y-intercepts and it\\'s frankly not that\\nhard to convert it to slope-intercept form. Let\\'s do that just to make it clear. So if you start with 9X, let me do that in yellow. If we start with 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72 and we want to put it\\nin slope-intercept form, we can subtract 9X from both sides. You get 16Y is equal to\\nnegative 9X, plus 72. And then divide both sides by 16. So divide everthing by 16. And you\\'ll be left with Y is equal to negative 9/16X, that\\'s the slope, you see it right there, plus 72 over 16, we already figured out that\\'s 9/2 or 4.5. So I could write, oh I\\'ll\\njust write that as 4.5. And this form over here, much\\neasier to figure out the slope and, actually, the\\ny-intercept jumps out at you. But the x-intercept isn\\'t as obvious. ',\n",
       " '5.5.2': \"Create a graph of the\\nlinear equation 5x plus 2y is equal to 20. So the line is\\nessentially the set of all coordinate,\\nall x's and y's, that satisfy this relationship\\nright over here. To make things simpler,\\nwhat we're going to do is set up a table\\nwhere we're going to put a bunch of x values\\nin and then figure out the corresponding y value\\nbased on this relationship. But to make it a\\nlittle bit simpler, I'm going to solve for y here. So it becomes easier to\\nsolve for y for any given x. So we have 5x plus\\n2y is equal to 20. If we want to solve\\nfor y, let's just get rid of the 5x on\\nthe left-hand side. So let's subtract 5x from\\nboth sides of this equation. The left-hand side,\\nthese guys cancel out, so we get 2y is equal\\nto the right hand side, you have 20 minus 5x. And then you can divide both\\nsides of this equation by 2. So you divide both sides by 2. The left-hand side, we\\njust have a y, and then the right-hand side, we\\ncould leave it that way. That actually would be a\\npretty straightforward way to leave it, or we could\\ncall this 20 divided by 2 is 10 minus 5x over 2\\nor minus 5/2 times x. And so now using\\nthis, let's just come up with a bunch\\nof x values and see what the corresponding y values\\nare, and then just plot them. So let me do this\\nin a new color. So let me-- a slightly\\ndifferent shade of yellow. So we have x values,\\nand then let's think about what\\nthe corresponding y value is going to be. So I'll start, well, I\\ncould start anywhere. I'll start at x is equal\\nto 0, just because that tends to keep things\\npretty simple. If x is 0, then y is equal\\nto 10 minus 5/2 times 0, which is equal to\\n5/2 times 0 is just a 0. So it's just 10 minus 0 or 10. So that gives us the coordinate,\\nthe point, 0 comma 10. When x is 0, y is 10. So x is 0. So it's going to be right here\\nat the middle of the x-axis. And you go up 10 for\\nthe y-coordinate. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. So it's right over here. So that's the point 0 comma 10. Let's do another point. Let's say that x is 2. I'm going to pick\\nmultiples of 2 here just so that I get a\\nnice clean answer here. So when x is 2, then y is\\nequal to 10 minus 5/2 times 2, and the 2 in the\\ndenominator cancels out with this 2 in the numerator. So it simplifies to\\n10 minus 5, or just 5. So that tells us the point\\nx equals 2, y is equal to 5, is on the line. So 2x is equal to 1,\\n2 right over here. And then y is equal to 5. You go up 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, just like that. So that's the point 2, 5. And when you're drawing\\na line you actually just need two points. If you have a ruler or\\nany kind of straight edge, we could just connect\\nthese two points. And if we do it neatly,\\nevery point on that line should satisfy this\\nrelationship right here. Just so we get practice,\\nI'll do more points. So let me do, let's say\\nwhen x is equal to 4, then y is equal to\\n10 minus 5/2 times 4. This is equal to 5/2 times 4. This is equal to 10, right? Because the 2, divide the\\ndenominator by 2 you get 1, divide the numerator by\\n2 you get 2, or 4 over 2 is the same thing as 2. So it becomes 2 times 5\\nis 10, 10 minus 10 is 0. So the point 4 comma\\n0 is on our line. So x is 1, 2, 3,\\n4, and then y is 0. So we don't move up at\\nall, so we have 4 comma 0. And I could keep going. I could try other points. You could do them if you\\nlike, but this is plenty. Just two of these would have\\nbeen enough to draw the line. So let me just draw it. So I'll do it in white. So the line will look\\nsomething like this. And I could keep going\\nin both directions. So there you have it. That is the graph of\\nour linear equation. Let me make my line\\na little bit bolder, just in case you found that\\nfirst line hard to read. So let me make it a\\nlittle bit bolder. And I think you get\\nthe general idea. \",\n",
       " '5.5.3': \"- [Instructor] We've talked about the idea of standard form of a linear\\nequation in other videos, and the point of this video\\nis to clarify something and resolve some differences\\nthat you might see in different classes in terms\\nof what standard form is. So everyone agrees that standard form is generally a linear equation where you have some number times x plus some number times y\\nis equal to some number. So things that are in\\nstandard form would include things like three x plus\\nfour y is equal to 10, or two x plus five y is equal to negative 10. Everyone would agree that\\nthese are standard form, and everyone would\\nagree that the following are not standard form. So if I were to write three x is equal to negative four y plus 10. Even though these are\\nequivalent equations, this is just not in standard form. Similarly, if I wrote that y is equal to three times x plus seven, this\\nis also not in standard form. Now the place where some\\npeople might disagree is if you were to see something like six x plus eight y is equal to 20. Now why would some folks argue that this is not standard form? Well, for some folks, they\\nwould say standard form, the coefficients on x and\\ny and our constant term, so our A, B and C, can't\\nshare any common factors. Here, six, eight and 20,\\nthey're all divisible by two, so some folks would argue that\\nthis is not standard form, and to get it into standard form, you would divide all of these by two, and if you did, you would\\nget this equation here. Now that's useful because\\nthen you only have one unique equation, but on Khan Academy, we do not restrict in that way, and that is also a very popular\\nway of thinking about it. We just want you to think\\nabout it in this form, Ax plus By is equal to C. When you do the exercises\\non the Khan Academy, it's not going to be checking\\nwhether these coefficients, A, B and C are divisible,\\nhave a common factor. So for Khan Academy purposes, this is considered standard form, although don't be surprised\\nif you encounter some folks who say, no, we would rather\\nyou remove any common factors. Now another example\\nwould be something like negative three x minus four\\ny is equal to negative 10. So some folks would argue\\nthat this is not standard form because they want to see\\nthis first coefficient right over here, the A,\\nbeing greater than zero, while here it is less than zero. For our purposes on Khan Academy, we do consider this standard form, but I'm just letting you know, because some folks might not because this leading coefficient\\nis not greater than zero. Now another example that\\nsome people might be on the edge with would be something like 1.25 x plus 5.50 y is equal to 10.5. The reason why some people\\nmight not consider this standard form is that A,\\nB and C are not integers. Some folks would say\\nto be in standard form, A, B and C need to be integers, and you could multiply\\nboth sides of the equation by some value that will give\\nyou integers for A, B, and C, but for Khan Academy purposes, we do consider this to\\nbe in standard form. We think this is important, actually not just being\\nable to have non-integers as A, B or C, but also being able to have a negative A, right over there, because negative three is our A, and also having coefficients,\\nhaving our As, Bs and Cs having shared factors, we\\nthing all of that's important because sometimes the\\nequation itself has meaning when you write it that way. We'll see that when we\\ndo some word problems, when we actually go into some real life and we try to construct equations, and based on the\\ninformation in the equation, it's easier to understand\\nif you keep it in this form. So for Khan Academy purposes,\\nthis is all standard form, but it's good to be aware\\nin your mathematical lives that some folks might want\\nto see the restriction of no common factor between A, B and C, that A is greater than zero, and that A, B and C\\nneed to all be integers, but Khan Academy does\\nnot hold you to that. \",\n",
       " '5.5.4': \"- Rewrite Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7 in standard form. The equation must be simplified, which means all numbers must be integers that do not share a common\\nfactor other than one. Alright, we'll worry about this\\nsecond part in a little bit. Let's see if we can rewrite this. So it's Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. Let me get my scratch pad out. So it's Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. So the way that it's written right now, this is slope intercept form. It's written in the form Y is equal to mx plus b, where m in this case is 2/3 and b is 4/7. It's very easy to figure\\nout what the slope and what the Y intercept\\nis from this equation. But we wanna write this in standard form. Which would be the form Ax plus By is equal to C. And that extra text they were saying, the equation must be simplified. Which means all numbers must be integers that do not share a common\\nfactor other than one. That just means that A, B,\\nand C in the standard form they want need to be integers. And they want them to not\\nhave any common factors. So if we got to the point of say 4x plus 2y is equal to 10, well this number, and this\\nnumber, and this number are all divisible by two. They all have the common factor of two. So we would want to simplify it more. Divide them all by two\\nand then you would get two so you divide this by two. You get 2x, divide this by two you'll get plus y is equal to 5. So this is the form\\nthat they're asking for and probably because it's just easier for the site to know that\\nthis is the right answer. Because there's obviously a\\nbunch of forms in this way. So let's see if we can do that. Let's see if we can write\\nit in standard form. So the first thing I would wanna do is, well there's a bunch of ways\\nthat you could approach it. The first thing you could try to do is well let's get rid of\\nall of these fractions. And the best way to get\\nrid of the fractions is to multiple by three\\nand to multiply by seven. If you multiply by three you\\nget rid of this fraction. If you multiply by seven you\\nget rid of this fraction. So if you multiply three\\nand you multiply by seven. Let me just rewrite it over here. There's actually also a couple\\nof ways that we can do this. So if you multiply. So one way to do it. So we start with Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. So if I multiply this side by\\nthree and I multiply by seven, I have to do that to this side as well. So this is going to be multiplied by three and multiplied by seven. So the left hand side becomes 21y. 21y. Three times seven of course is\\n21, we just figured that out. We would distribute the 21. 21 times 2/3, well let's see. 21 divided by three is\\nseven, times two is 14. So it's gonna be 14x. And then 21 divided by seven\\nis three times four is 12. So just like that I was able\\nto get rid of the fractions. And now I wanna get all the X's and Y's on one side. So I wanna get this\\n14x onto the left side. So let's see if I can do that. So I'm gonna do that by. To get rid of this I would\\nwant to subtract 14x. I can't just do it on the right hand side I have to do it on the\\nleft hand side as well. So I wanna subtract 14x, and\\nthen what am I left with? Let me give myself a\\nlittle bit more space. So on the left hand side I have negative 14x plus 21y. Plus 21y is equal to. Let's see and I subtracted\\n14x to get rid of this. And then I have this is equal to 12. Now let's see, am I done? Do these share any, do 14, 21, and 12 share any common factors? Let's see, 14 is divisible\\nby two and seven. 21 is divisible by three and seven. 12 is divisible by two, six, three, four. But all of these aren't\\ndivisible by the same number. 14, let's see. 14 is divisible two,\\nso is 12, but 21 isn't. 14 is divisible by seven,\\nso is 21, but 12 isn't. And 21 and 12 are divisible\\nby three but 14 isn't. So I think this is about as\\nsimplified as I could get. If there was a common factor\\nfor all three of these numbers then I would divide all\\nof them the way I did in that previous example. But that's not the case right over here. So it's negative 14x\\nplus 21y is equal to 12. So let me see if I can\\nremember that and type that in. So it is, negative 14x plus 21y is equal to 12. Now let's see if I got it right. It worked out. \",\n",
       " '5.6.1': \"- [Instructor] We've got the\\nequation Y plus two is equal to negative two, times X minus three. And, what I wanna do is figure out what is the slope of the line\\nthat this equation describes? And there's a couple of ways\\nthat you can approach it. What my brain wants to do is well, I know a few forms where it's easy to pick out the slope. For example, if I can manipulate that equation to be in the form Y is equal to MX plus B, well then I know that this M here, the\\ncoefficient on the X term, well that's going to be my slope. And B is going to be my Y intercept, we cover that in many other videos. Another option is to get\\ninto point-slope form. So the general framework\\nor the general template for point-slope form is,\\nif I have an equation of the form Y minus Y1\\nis equal to M times X minus X1, well then I immediately know that the line that this equation describes is going to have a slope of M once again. And here the Y intercept\\ndoesn't jump out at you. Let me make sure you\\ncan read this over here. The Y intercept doesn't jump out at you, but you know a point that is on this line. In particular, you know\\nthat the point X1, Y1 is going to be on this line. X1, Y1. So let's look at our original example. So it might immediately jump out at you that this is actually\\nin point-slope form. You might say, well okay, I see I have a minus X1, so X1 would be three, I have my slope here and\\nthat answers our question, our slope would be negative two. But here it says plus two,\\nI have to subtract a Y1. Well, you could just rewrite this, so it says, so you have\\nY minus negative two is equal to negative\\ntwo times X minus three, and then you see it's exactly this point-slope form right over here. So our slope right over\\nthere is negative two, and then if I were to ask you, well give me a point\\nthat sits on this line, you could say, alright,\\nan X1 would be three, and a Y1 would be negative two. This point sits on the line,\\nit's not the Y intercept, but it's a point on the line and we know the slope is negative two. Now another way to approach this is to just manipulate it so that we get into slope-intercept form. So let's do that, let's manipulate it so we get into slope-intercept form. So the first thing my brain wants to do is distribute this negative two, and if I do that, I get Y plus two is equal to negative 2x, negative two times negative three, plus six. And then I can subtract\\ntwo from both sides, and then I get Y is equal\\nto negative 2x plus four. And so here I am in\\nslope Y intercept form, and once again, I could\\nsay, alright my M here, the coefficient on the\\nX term, is my slope. So my slope is negative two. Let's do another example. So here, this equation\\ndoesn't immediately go into either one of these\\nforms, so let's manipulate it. And if it's in either one of them, I like to get into slope Y intercept form, it's a little bit easier\\nfor my brain to understand. So let's do that. So let us collect, well let's get the Xs, let's just isolate the Y\\non the right-hand side, since the 2y is already there. So let's add three to both sides. I'm just trying to get rid\\nof this negative three. So if we add three to both sides, on the left-hand side we\\nhave negative 4x plus 10 is equal to 2y, these cancel out. That was the whole point. And now to solve for Y, we just have to divide both sides by two. So if we divide everything by two, we get negative 2x plus\\nfive is equal to Y. So this is in slope-intercept form. I just have the Y on the\\nright-hand side instead of the left-hand side. We have Y is equal to mx plus B, and so our M is the coefficient on the X term right over here. So our slope is once\\nagain, is negative two, and here our Y intercept is five, in case we wanted to know it. Let's do one more\\nexample, one more example. Alright, so once again, this\\nis in neither slope-intercept or point-slope form to begin with, so let's just try to get\\nit to slope-intercept form. And like always, pause the video, and see if you can figure it out yourself. Alright, so let's get all the Ys on the left-hand side isolated, and the Xs on the right-hand side. So let me get rid of this negative 3x. So I'm gonna add 3x to both sides, and let's get rid of\\nthis 3y right over here. So let's subtract 3y from both sides. You couldn't do this, I'm\\ndoing two steps at once, but once again, I'm trying to get rid of this 3x, so I'm trying to get rid of this negative 3x, so I add 3x to the left, but I have\\nto do it to the right if I want to maintain the equality. And if I want to get rid of this 3y, well I subtract 3y from here, but I have to do it on the left-hand side if I want to maintain the equality. So what do I get? That cancels out, 5y minus 3y is 2y, is equal to 2x plus 3x is 5x, and then these two characters cancel out. And so if I want to solve for Y, I just divide both\\nsides by two and I get Y is equal to five halves X, and I'm done. And you mights say wait,\\nif this doesn't look exactly like slope-intercept form, where is my B? Well your B, if you wanted to see it, you could just write plus zero, B is implicitly zero right over here. So your slope, your slope is going to be the coefficient on the X term, it's going to be five halves. And if you want to know your Y intercept, well it's zero, when X is zero, Y is zero. \",\n",
       " '5.6.2': \"A line passes through the points\\nnegative 3, 6 and 6, 0. Find the equation of this line\\nin point slope form, slope intercept form, standard form. And the way to think about\\nthese, these are just three different ways of writing\\nthe same equation. So if you give me one of them,\\nwe can manipulate it to get any of the other ones. But just so you know what these\\nare, point slope form, let's say the point x1, y1 are,\\nlet's say that that is a point on the line. And when someone puts this\\nlittle subscript here, so if they just write an x, that means\\nwe're talking about a variable that can take\\non any value. If someone writes x with a\\nsubscript 1 and a y with a subscript 1, that's like saying\\na particular value x and a particular value of y,\\nor a particular coordinate. And you'll see that when\\nwe do the example. But point slope form says\\nthat, look, if I know a particular point, and if I know\\nthe slope of the line, then putting that line in point\\nslope form would be y minus y1 is equal to\\nm times x minus x1. So, for example, and we'll do\\nthat in this video, if the point negative 3 comma 6 is on\\nthe line, then we'd say y minus 6 is equal to m times x\\nminus negative 3, so it'll end up becoming x plus 3. So this is a particular\\nx, and a particular y. It could be a negative\\n3 and 6. So that's point slope form. Slope intercept form is y is\\nequal to mx plus b, where once again m is the slope, b is the\\ny-intercept-- where does the line intersect the y-axis--\\nwhat value does y take on when x is 0? And then standard form is the\\nform ax plus by is equal to c, where these are just two\\nnumbers, essentially. They really don't have\\nany interpretation directly on the graph. So let's do this, let's figure\\nout all of these forms. So the first thing we want to do\\nis figure out the slope. Once we figure out the slope,\\nthen point slope form is actually very, very, very\\nstraightforward to calculate. So, just to remind ourselves,\\nslope, which is equal to m, which is going to be equal to\\nthe change in y over the change in x. Now what is the change in y? If we view this as our end\\npoint, if we imagine that we are going from here to\\nthat point, what is the change in y? Well, we have our end point,\\nwhich is 0, y ends up at the 0, and y was at 6. So, our finishing y point is 0,\\nour starting y point is 6. What was our finishing x\\npoint, or x-coordinate? Our finishing x-coordinate\\nwas 6. Let me make this very clear, I\\ndon't want to confuse you. So this 0, we have that 0, that\\nis that 0 right there. And then we have this 6, which\\nwas our starting y point, that is that 6 right there. And then we want our finishing x\\nvalue-- that is that 6 right there, or that 6 right there--\\nand we want to subtract from that our starting x value. Well, our starting x value is\\nthat right over there, that's that negative 3. And just to make sure we know\\nwhat we're doing, this negative 3 is that negative\\n3, right there. I'm just saying, if we go from\\nthat point to that point, our y went down by 6, right? We went from 6 to 0. Our y went down by 6. So we get 0 minus\\n6 is negative 6. That makes sense. Y went down by 6. And, if we went from that point\\nto that point, what happened to x? We went from negative 3 to\\n6, it should go up by 9. And if you calculate this, take\\nyour 6 minus negative 3, that's the same thing as\\n6 plus 3, that is 9. And what is negative 6/9? Well, if you simplify it,\\nit is negative 2/3. You divide the numerator and\\nthe denominator by 3. So that is our slope,\\nnegative 2/3. So we're pretty much ready\\nto use point slope form. We have a point, we could pick\\none of these points, I'll just go with the negative 3, 6. And we have our slope. So let's put it in\\npoint slope form. All we have to do is we say y\\nminus-- now we could have taken either of these points,\\nI'll take this one-- so y minus the y value over here, so\\ny minus 6 is equal to our slope, which is negative\\n2/3 times x minus our x-coordinate. Well, our x-coordinate, so x\\nminus our x-coordinate is negative 3, x minus negative\\n3, and we're done. We can simplify it\\na little bit. This becomes y minus 6 is equal\\nto negative 2/3 times x. x minus negative 3 is the\\nsame thing as x plus 3. This is our point slope form. Now, we can literally just\\nalgebraically manipulate this guy right here to put it into\\nour slope intercept form. Let's do that. So let's do slope intercept\\nin orange. So we have slope intercept. So what can we do here\\nto simplify this? Well, we can multiply out the\\nnegative 2/3, so you get y minus 6 is equal to-- I'm just\\ndistributing the negative 2/3-- so negative 2/3 times\\nx is negative 2/3 x. And then negative 2/3 times\\n3 is negative 2. And now to get it in slope\\nintercept form, we just have to add the 6 to both sides so\\nwe get rid of it on the left-hand side, so let's\\nadd 6 to both sides of this equation. Left-hand side of the equation,\\nwe're just left with a y, these guys cancel out. You get a y is equal\\nto negative 2/3 x. Negative 2 plus 6 is plus 4. So there you have it, that is\\nour slope intercept form, mx plus b, that's our\\ny-intercept. Now the last thing we need\\nto do is get it into the standard form. So once again, we just have to\\nalgebraically manipulate it so that the x's and the\\ny's are both on this side of the equation. So let's just add 2/3 x to both\\nsides of this equation. So I'll start it here. So we have y is equal to\\nnegative 2/3 x plus 4, that's slope intercept form. Let's added 2/3 x, so\\nplus 2/3 x to both sides of this equation. I'm doing that so it I don't\\nhave this 2/3 x on the right-hand side, this\\nnegative 2/3 x. So the left-hand side of the\\nequation-- I scrunched it up a little bit, maybe more than I\\nshould have-- the left-hand side of this equation is what? It is 2/3 x, because 2 over\\n3x, plus this y, that's my left-hand side, is equal to--\\nthese guys cancel out-- is equal to 4. So this, by itself, we are in\\nstandard form, this is the standard form of the equation. If we want it to look, make it\\nlook extra clean and have no fractions here, we could\\nmultiply both sides of this equation by 3. If we do that, what do we get? 2/3 x times 3 is just 2x. y times 3 is 3y. And then 4 times 3 is 12. These are the same equations,\\nI just multiplied every term by 3. If you do it to the left-hand\\nside, you can do to the right-hand side-- or you have to\\ndo to the right-hand side-- and we are in standard form. \",\n",
       " '6.1.1': \"You are traveling in some type\\nof a strange fantasy land. And you're trying\\nto get to the castle up here to save the\\nprincess or the prince or whomever you're\\ntrying to save. But to get there, you\\nhave to cross this river. You can't swim across it. It's a very rough river. So you have to\\ncross this bridge. And so as you approach the\\nbridge, this troll shows up. That's the troll. And he says, well, I'm\\na reasonable troll. You just have to pay $5. And when you look a\\nlittle bit more carefully, you see that there\\nactually was a sign there that says $5 toll\\nto cross the bridge. Now, unfortunately\\nfor you, you do not have any money in your pocket. And so the troll says,\\nwell, you can't cross. But you say, I need to really,\\nreally get to that castle. And so the troll says, well,\\nI'll take some pity on you. Instead of paying the $5,\\nI will give you a riddle. And the riddle is this. And now, I'm speaking\\nas the troll. I am a rich troll\\nbecause I get to charge from everyone who\\ncrosses the bridge. And actually, I only\\naccept $5 or $10 bills. It's a bit of a\\nriddle why they accept American currency in\\nthis fantasy land. But let's just take\\nthat as a given for now. So I only take $5 or $10 bills. I'm being the troll. Obviously, if you give me a\\n$10, I'll give you $5 back. And I know, because I count\\nmy money on a daily basis. I like to save my\\nmoney as the troll. I know that I have a\\ntotal of 900 bills. So let me write that down. I have a total of 900 bills, a\\ntotal of 900 $5 and $10 bills. And he says, because\\nI'm very sympathetic, I'll give you another\\npiece of information. He says, if you were to\\nadd up the value of all of my money, which is all in\\n$5 and $10 bills that I have, I, speaking as the troll about\\ndollars bills, is $5,500. This is a rich troll. And so the riddle\\nis-- exactly, exactly. And if you give the wrong\\nanswer and if you're not able to solve it\\nin 10 minutes, he's just going to push\\nyou into the river or do something horrible to you. He says, exactly how many 5's\\nand 10's do I, the troll, have? So the first thing I'm going\\nto have you think about is, is this even a\\nsolvable problem? Because if it's not\\na solvable problem, you should probably\\nrun as fast as you can in the other direction. So now, I will tell you, yes,\\nit is a solvable problem. And let's start thinking about\\nit a little bit algebraically. And to do that, let's\\njust set some variables. And I will set the\\nvariables to be what we're really\\ntrying to solve for. We're trying to solve for the\\nnumber of $5 bills we have and the number of $10\\nbills that we have. So let's just define\\nsome variables. I'll say f for 5. Let's let f equal the number\\nof $5 bills that we have. And I'll use the same idea. Let's let t is equal to the\\nnumber $10 bills that we have. Now, given this\\ninformation, and now I'm not sure if I'm\\nspeaking as-- well, let's say I'm still\\nspeaking as the troll. I'm a very sympathetic\\ntroll, and I'm going to give you hints. Given this information and\\nsetting these variables in this way, can I represent\\nthe clues in the riddle mathematically? So let's focus on\\nthe first clue. Can I represent this clue that\\nthe total of 900 $5 and $10 bills, or can I represent\\nthat mathematically, that I have a total of\\n900 $5 and $10 bills? Well, what's going to\\nbe our total of bills? It's going to be the number of\\n5's that we have, which is f. The number of 5's\\nthat we have is f. And then the number of\\n10s that we have is t. The total number of 5's\\nplus the total number of 10s, that's our\\ntotal number of bills. So that's going to\\nbe equal to 900. So this statement, this\\nfirst clue in our riddle, can be written\\nmathematically like this if we defined the\\nvariables like that. And I just said f for 5,\\nbecause f for 5 in t for 10. Now, let's look at\\nthe second clue. Can we represent this\\none mathematically given these variable definitions\\nthat we created? Well, let's think separately\\nabout the value of the $5 bills and the value of the $10 bills. What's the value of\\nall of the $5 bills? Well, each $5 bill is worth $5. So it's going to be 5 times\\nthe number of $5 bills that we have. So if I have one $5\\nbill, it will be $5. If I have 100 $5 bills,\\nthen it's going to be $500. How ever many $5 bills,\\nI just multiply it by 5. That's the value\\nof the $5 bills. Let me write that down. Value of the $5 bills. Now, same logic. What's the value\\nof the $10 bills? Well, the value of\\nthe $10 bills is just going to be 10 times\\nhowever many bills I have-- value of the $10 bills. So what's going to be the\\ntotal value of my bills? Well, it's going to be\\nthe value of the $5 bills plus the value of the $10 bills? And he tells me what\\nthat total value is. It's $5,500. So if I add these\\ntwo things, they're going to add up to be $5,500. So this second statement we\\ncan represent mathematically with this second\\nequation right over here. And what we essentially\\nhave right over here, we have two equations. Each of them have two unknowns. And just using one\\nof these equations, we can't really figure\\nout what f and t are. You can pick a bunch of\\ndifferent combinations that add up to 900 here. You could pick a bunch of\\ndifferent combinations, where if you work out all the\\nmath, you get $5,500. So independently,\\nthese equations, you don't know what f and t are. But what we will see over\\nthe next several videos is that if you use both of\\nthis information, if you say that there's\\nan f and a t that has to satisfy both\\nof these equations, then you can find a solution. And this is called a\\nsystem of equations. Let me write that down--\\nsystem of equations. \",\n",
       " '6.1.2': \"Where we left off, we\\nwere trying our very best to get to the castle\\nand save whomever we were needing to save. But we had to cross the\\nbridge and the troll gave us these clues because\\nwe had no money in our pocket. And if we don't\\nsolve his riddle, he's going to push\\nus into the water. So we are under pressure. And at least we made some\\nheadway in the last video. We were able to represent\\nhis clues mathematically as a system of equations. What I want to do in\\nthis video is think about whether we can solve for\\nthis system of equations. And you'll see that\\nthere are many ways of solving a system\\nof equations. But this time I want\\nto do it visually. Because at least in my\\nmind, it helps really get the intuition of what\\nthese things are saying. So let's draw some\\naxes over here. Let's draw an f-axis. That's the number of\\nfives that I have. And let's draw a t-axis. That is the number\\nof tens I have. And let's say that this\\nright over here is 500 tens. That is 1,000 tens. And let's say this is-- oh,\\nsorry, that's 500 fives. That's 1,000 fives. This is 500 tens, And\\nthis is 1,000 tens. So let's think about all of\\nthe combinations of f's and t's that satisfy this\\nfirst equation. If we have no tens, then\\nwe're going to have 900 fives. So that looks like\\nit's right about there. So that's the point\\n0 tens, 900 fives. But what if went the other way? If we have no fives, we're\\ngoing to have 900 tens. So that's going to be the\\npoint 900 tens, 0 fives. So all the combinations of\\nf's and t's that satisfy this are going to be on this\\nline right over there. And I'll just draw a dotted line\\njust because it's easier for me to draw it straight. So that represents all the\\nf's and t's that satisfy the first constraint. Obviously, there's\\na bunch of them, so we don't know\\nwhich is the one that is actually what the troll has. But lucky for us, we have\\na second constraint-- this one right over here. So let's do the same thing. In this constraint, what\\nhappens if we have no tens? If tens are 0, then we\\nhave 5f is equal to 5,500. Let me do a little\\ntable here, because this is a little bit more involved. So for the second\\nequation, tens and fives. If I have no tens, I have\\n5f is equal to 5,500, f will be 1,100. I must have 1,100 fives. If I have no fives,\\nthen this is 0, and I have 10t is\\nequal to 5,500, that means I have 550 tens. So let's plot both\\nat those point. t equals 0, f is 11. That's right about there. So that is 0. 1,100 is on the line that\\nrepresents this equation. And that when f is 0, t is 550. So let's see, this is about--\\nthis would be 6, 7, 8, 9, so 550 is going to\\nbe right over here. So that is the\\npoint 550 comma 0. And all of these\\npoints-- let me try to draw a straight line again. I could do a better\\njob than that. So all of these points\\nare the points-- let me try one more time. We want to get this right. We don't want to get pushed\\ninto the water by the troll. So there you go. That looks pretty good. So every point on this blue line\\nrepresents an ft combination that satisfies the\\nsecond constraint. So what is an f and t, or\\nnumber of fives and number of tens that satisfy\\nboth constraints? Well, it would be\\na point that is sitting on both of the lines. And what is a point that is\\nsitting on both of the lines? Well, that's where\\nthey intersect. This point right over here\\nis clearly on the blue line and is clearly on\\nthe yellow line. And what we can do is, if\\nwe drew this graph really, really precisely, we could\\nsee how many fives that is and how many tens that is. And if you look at it, if\\nyou look at very precisely, and actually I encourage you\\nto graph it very precisely and come up with how many fives\\nand how many tens that is. Well, when we do it right over\\nhere, I'm going to eyeball it. If we look at it\\nright over here, it looks like we\\nhave about 700 fives, and it looks like we\\nhave about 200 tens. And this is based on\\nmy really rough graph. But let's see if that worked. 700 plus 200 is equal to 900. And if I have 700 fives--\\nlet me write this down. 5 times 700 is going to be\\nthe value of the fives, which is $3,500. And then 10 plus 10 times\\n200, which is $2,000, $2,000 is the value of the 10s. And if you add up\\nthe two values, you indeed get to $ 5,500 So this looks right. And so we can tell\\nthe troll-- Troll! I know! I know how many $5\\nand $10 bills you. You have 700 $5 bills, and\\nyou have 200 $10 bills. The troll is\\nimpressed, and he lets you cross the bridge to be the\\nhero or heroine of this fantasy adventure. \",\n",
       " '6.1.3': \"Is negative 1 comma 7 a\\nsolution for the system of linear equations below? And they give us\\nthe first equation is x plus 2y is equal to 13. Second equation is 3x minus\\ny is equal to negative 11. In order for negative\\n1 comma 7 to be a solution for the\\nsystem, it needs to satisfy both equations. Or another way of thinking about\\nit, x equals 7, and y-- sorry, x is equal to negative 1. This is the x coordinate. X equals negative 1, and\\ny is equal to 7, need to satisfy both of\\nthese equations in order for it to be a Solution. So let's try it out. Let's try it out with\\nthe first equation. So we have x plus\\n2y is equal to 13. So if we're thinking\\nabout that, we're testing to see if when x\\nis equal to negative 1, and y is equal to 7,\\nwill x plus 2y equals 13? So we have negative\\n1 plus 2 times 7-- y should be 7-- this\\nneeds to be equal to 13. And I'll put a\\nquestion mark there because we don't\\nknow whether it does. So this is the same\\nthing as negative 1 plus 2 times 7 plus 14. That does, indeed, equal 13. Negative 1 plus 14, this is 13. So 13 does definitely equal 13. So this point it does, at least,\\nsatisfy this first equation. This point does sit on the\\ngraph of this first equation, or on the line of\\nthis first equation. Now let's look at\\nthe second equation. I'll do that one in blue. We have 3 times negative\\n1 minus y, so minus 7, needs to be equal\\nto negative 11. I'll put a question\\nmark here because we don't know whether\\nit's true or not. So let's see, we have 3 times\\nnegative 1 is negative 3. And then we have minus 7 needs\\nto be equal to negative 11-- I put the question mark there. Negative 3 minus 7,\\nthat's negative 10. So we get negative 10\\nequaling negative 11. No, negative 10 does\\nnot equal a negative 11. So x equaling negative\\n1, and y equaling 7 does not satisfy\\nthe second equation. So it does not sit on its graph. So this over here is not\\na solution for the system. So the answer is no. It satisfies the\\nfirst equation, but it doesn't satisfy the second. In order to be a\\nsolution for the system, it has to satisfy\\nboth equations. \",\n",
       " '6.1.4': \"- [Instructor] In this\\nvideo, we're gonna get some more practice setting\\nup systems of equations. Not solving them, but\\njust setting them up. So we're told Sanjay's\\ndog weighs five times as much as his cat. His dog is also 20 kilograms\\nheavier than his cat. Let c be the cat's weight and\\nlet d be the dog's weight. So pause this video and\\nsee if you can set up a system of equation, two linear\\nequations with two unknowns that we could use to solve for c and d, but we don't have to in this video. All right so let's do it together. So, what I like to do is\\nusually there's a sentence or two that describes\\neach of the equations we wanna set up. So this first one tells us\\nSanjay's dog weighs five times as much as his cat. So how much does his dog weigh? So his dog weighs d, so we\\nknow d is going to be equal to five times as much as his cat weighs. So his cat weighs c, so d is\\ngoing to be equal to five times as much as his cat weighs. So that's one linear\\nequation using d and c. And so what's another one? Well, then we are told his dog\\nis also 20 kilograms heavier than his cat. So we could say that the\\ndog's weight is going to be equal to the cat's weight plus what? Plus 20 kilograms. We're assuming everything's in kilograms, so I don't have to write the units. But there you have it, I have\\njust set up two equations in two unknowns, two linear equations, based on the information\\ngiven in this word problem, which we could then\\nsolve, and I encourage you to do so if you're curious. But sometimes, the difficult\\npart is just to find, is to re-express the\\ninformation that you're given in a mathematical form. But as you see, as you get practice, it becomes somewhat intuitive. What we see in blue is\\njust another way of writing what we underline in blue\\nand what we see in yellow is just another way of\\nwriting or expressing wat we underlined in yellow up there. \",\n",
       " '6.1.5': \"- [Instructor] In this video, we're going to get a little bit of practice setting up\\nsystems of linear equations based on a word problem. We're not actually going\\nto end up solving it. You can do that if you\\nlike just for kicks. But really we're going to\\njust focus on setting it up. So here we're told Lauren uses\\na blend of dark roast beans and light roast beans to\\nmake coffee at her cafe. She needs 80 kilograms of beans\\nin total for her next order. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and someone wants to spend $220 total. Let D be the number of kilograms of dark roast beans she buys and L be the number of kilograms of light roast beans she buys. All right, so based on this information that we've been given, see\\nif you can pause this video and set up a system of equations. And it's going to have two equations with two unknowns, D and L,\\nthat in theory we could solve to figure out the right\\nnumber of kilograms of dark roast beans and light roast beans that Karen should use. So pause this video and\\ntry to work that out. All right, now let's do it together. And what I'm going to do\\nis I'm going to underline. So let's see, we know\\nthat D is dark roast beans and the L is the number of\\nkilograms of light roast beans. And then they tell us here, they say she needs 80\\nkilograms of beans in total. So what we could say is,\\nhey, the number of kilograms of dark roast beans plus\\nthe number of kilograms of light roast beans needs\\nto be equal to 80 kilograms. So the number of kilograms\\nof dark roast beans plus the number of kilograms\\nof light roast beans. (laughs) I'm having trouble\\nsaying light roast beans. Well, this, what I just underlined here, it says needs to be 80 kilograms in total. So that needs to be 80. So this number of kilograms plus this number of kilograms\\nis going to be equal to your total number of kilograms. All right, so I have one\\nequation with two unknowns. Let's see if we can get another one. So next, they say dark roast\\nbeans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she wants to spend $220 total. So what I just underlined\\nin this aquamarine color we can set up another equation with. And if you haven't already set\\nup your system of equations, see if you can now do that. See if you can set up\\nthis second equation. Pause the video. All right, well, the way to think about it is we just have\\nto have an expression for how much did she\\nspend on dark roast beans, how much did she spend\\non light roast beans, and then we need to\\nadd those two together, and that needs to be equal to $220 'cause that's how much she\\nwants to spend in total. So how much does she\\nspend on dark roast beans? Well, it's going to be\\nthe number of kilograms of dark roast beans that she buys, and it says that it cost $3 per kilogram, so we're gonna multiply it by three. $3 per kilogram times\\nthe number of kilograms of dark roast beans. This is how much she\\nspends on dark roast beans. And so how much is she going\\nto spend on light roast beans? Well, she buys L kilograms\\nof light roast beans. They told us that there. And they cost $2 per kilogram, so $2 per kilogram times\\nthe number of kilograms. This is how much she spends\\non light roast beans. So you add how much she\\nspends on dark roast to how much she spends on light roast, and so this is going to be $220 in total. And there you have it. We have our two equations\\nwith two unknowns, and so now we could go and solve it, but you can do that outside of this video. But the whole point of\\nthis video is to understand how to construct these\\nbased on the constraints, based on the information\\nthat we see in this. So typically when you're\\ntrying to set these up, there's often a sentence or two that will focus on one equation. So this first one is\\nsaying, hey, the kilograms, let's add those up for the\\ntotal number of kilograms. And then there's another\\nsentence or two that'll focus on, in this case, some other equation. In this case, it's the price. So the price of the dark\\nplus the price of the light is going to be equal to the\\ntotal amount she wants to spend. \",\n",
       " '6.1.6': \"- [Instructor] We're told\\nthat Lauren uses a blend of dark roast beans and light roast beans to make coffee at her cafe. She needs 80 kilograms of beans\\nin total for her next order. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she wants to spend $220 in total. And they tell us here's a graph that shows a system of\\nequations for this scenario where x is the number of kilograms of dark roast beans she buys and y is the number of kilograms of light roast beans she buys. All right, let me scroll down\\nso we can take a look at this. And so sure enough, so this blue line, and I'll write it out in blue, this x is the number of\\nkilograms of dark roast beans, y is the number of kilograms\\nof light roast beans, and she wants to buy a\\ntotal of 80 kilograms. That's what they told us up here. We can go back to look at that. She needs, I'll underline this in blue. She needs 80 kilograms of beans. So that constraint that\\nthe sum of the kilograms of dark and light is equal to 80, that's represented by this equation. And if we were to graph it, that is this blue line right over here. And then this other constraint, three x, well, the dark roast beans\\ncost $3 per kilogram, so three x is how much\\nshe spends on dark roast. Two y is how much she\\nspends on light roast 'cause it's $2 per kilogram. And 220 is the amount\\nthat she spends in total. And they tell us that up here. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she wants to spend $220. So this equation is\\nanother way of expressing what I just underlined up here in green. And the green line shows all of the x y combinations that\\nwould match these constraints. And so now let's do something interesting. They've labeled some points\\nhere, point C, D, F, and E. And we're gonna think about what do each of these points represent? So for example, this point\\nC that is on the green line, but it sits above the blue line, what does this tell us? What does this point C represent? Pause this video and think about it. Well, if we're on the green line, that means that the amount\\nthat she spends on dark roast plus the amount that she spends\\non light roast is adding up to exactly $220. So she's definitely spending $220 at C, but how many total kilograms is she using? Well, the fact that for this given x, we're sitting above the line, that means that she's not\\nusing exactly 80 kilograms. And we can see that over here. She's using, looks like\\n10 kilograms of dark, and it looks like something\\nlike 95 kilograms of light. If you were to add those\\ntwo points together, it looks like she's using\\nsomething closer to 105 kilograms. So point C is a situation where she is spending exactly $220, but she's using more than 80 kilograms 'cause it's not meeting\\nthis second constraint. It's sitting above that line. Now let's think about point D. What does that represent? Pause the video and\\ntry to figure that out. Well, because we sit on the blue line, that means that we are\\nmeeting this constraint that the kilograms of\\ndark and light combined is equal to 80 kilograms. So she's using exactly 80 kilograms here, but what about her spending? Well, because this point\\nlies below the green line, that tells us that we are spending less than $220. And we could even try it out. Three times 20 plus two times 60 is what? 60 plus 120 is $180. And so this is a point where\\nwe're meeting this constraint, but we're not meeting this constraint. We're underspending right over here. Now, what about point F? Well, point F sits below\\nboth of these lines. So pause your video and\\nthink about what that means. Well, if we're sitting\\nbelow both of these lines, that means that neither\\nare we spending $220, nor are we using 80 kilograms. And you can see that if you\\nactually look at the numbers. You don't have to do this, but this is just to make\\nyou feel good about it. It looks like she is\\nusing 30 kilograms of dark and 30 kilograms of light,\\nso in total she is using, so this is a situation where she's using 60\\nkilograms in total, not 80. And so that's why we're not\\nsitting on this blue line. And if you look at how\\nmuch she's spending, she has 30 kilograms of each, so three times 30 plus two times 30, that's going to be 90 plus 60. That's also less than 220, and so that's why we see this\\npoint is below these lines. And then last but not least,\\nwhat does point E represent? Well, point E sits on both of these lines, so that means that it meets\\nboth of these constraints. This is a situation where\\nshe is spending exactly $220, and the total number of\\nkilograms she's using of dark and light is exactly 80. And so if we wanted to\\nsay, hey, what combination of dark and light would she need in order to meet both\\nconstraints, E represents that, the intersection of these two lines. \",\n",
       " '6.2.1': \"Just as you were\\nsolving the potato chip conundrum in the last video,\\nthe king's favorite magical bird comes flying along and starts\\nwhispering into the king's ear. And this makes you a\\nlittle bit self-conscious, a little bit\\ninsecure, so you tell the king, what is the\\nbird talking about. And the king says,\\nwell, the bird says that he thinks that there's\\nanother way to do the problem. And you're not used to\\ntaking advice from birds. And so being a\\nlittle bit defensive, you say, well, if the bird\\nthinks he knows so much, let him do this problem. And so the bird whispers\\na little bit more in the king's ear and\\nsays, OK, well I'll have to do the writing\\nbecause the bird does not have any hands, or at least\\ncan't manipulate chalk. And so the bird continues to\\nwhisper in the king's ear. And the king\\ntranslates and says, well, the bird says, let's\\nuse one of these equations to solve for a variable. So let's say, let's us this\\nblue equation right over here to solve for a variable. And that's essentially\\ngoing to be a constraint of one variable\\nin terms of another. So let's see if we can do that. So here, if we want\\nto solve for m, we could subtract 400\\nw from both sides. And we would have 100 m. If we subtract 400w from the\\nleft, this 400w goes away. If we subtract 400w\\nfrom the right, we have is equal to\\nnegative 400w plus 1,100. So what got us from\\nhere to here is just subtracting 400w\\nfrom both sides. And then if we want\\nto solve for m, we just divide\\nboth sides by 100. So we just divide all\\nof the terms by 100. And then we get m is equal to\\nnegative 400 divided by 100, is negative 4w. 1,100 divided by 100 is 11. Plus 11. So now we've constrained\\nm in terms of w. This is what the\\nbird is saying, using the king as his translator. Why don't we take\\nthis constraint and substitute it back for\\nm in the first equation? And then we will have one\\nequation with one unknown. And so the king starts to\\nwrite at the bird's direction. 200, so he's looking at\\nthat first equation now, he says 200. Instead of putting\\nan m there, the bird says well, by the\\nsecond constraint, m is equal to\\nnegative 4w plus 11. So instead of writing an\\nm, we substitute for m the expression\\nnegative 4w plus 11. And then we have the rest of it,\\nplus 300w, is equal to 1,200. So just to be clear,\\neverywhere we saw an m, we replaced it with\\nthis right over here, in that first equation. So the first thing, you\\nstart to scratch your head. And you say, is this a\\nlegitimate thing to do. Will I get the same\\nanswer as I got when I solved the same\\nproblem with elimination? And I want you to sit and\\nthink about that for a second. But then the bird starts\\nwhispering in the king's ear. And the king just progresses to\\njust work through the algebra. This is one equation\\nwith one unknown now. So the first step would\\nbe to distribute the 200. So 200 times negative\\n4w is negative 800w. 200 times 11 is 2,200. Plus 2,200. And then we have the plus 300w. Plus 300w is equal\\nto positive 1,200. Now we just need to solve for w. We first might want to\\ngroup this negative 800w with this 300w. Negative 800 of something\\nplus 300 of something is going to be negative 500w. And then we still have this\\nplus 2,200 is equal to 1,200. Now to solve for w, we'd want to\\nsubtract 2,200 from both sides. So subtract 2,200,\\nsubtract 2,200. On the left-hand\\nside, you're left just with the negative 500w. And on the right-hand side, you\\nare left with negative 1,000. This is starting to\\nlook interesting, because if we divide both\\nsides by negative 500, we get w is equal to 2, which\\nis the exact same answer that we got when we tried to figure\\nout how many bags of chips each woman would eat on average. When we tried to solve\\nit with elimination, we got the exact right answer. So at least for this example,\\nit seems like the substitution method that this bird came\\nup with worked just as well as the elimination method\\nthat you had originally done the first time you wanted\\nto figure out the potato chip conundrum. And if now, you actually\\nwanted to figure out how many chips\\nthe men would eat, well, you could do\\nexactly the same thing you did the last time. You know one of the variables. You can substitute it back\\ninto one of the equations and then solve for m. And you could try that yourself\\nto verify that you actually will get the same\\nvalue for m as well. And in fact, this would\\nprobably be the easiest equation to substitute into,\\nbecause it explicitly solves for m already. \",\n",
       " '6.2.2': \"So that it's less likely that we get shown up by talking birds in the future, we've set a little bit of exercise for solving systems of equations with substitution. And so this is the first exercise or the first problem that they give us. -3x-4y=-2 and y=2x-5 So let me get out my little scratch pad and let me rewrite the problem. So this is -3x-4y=-2 and then they tell us y=2x-5. So, what's neat about this is that they've already solved the second equation. They've already made it explicitly solved for y which makes it very easy to substitute for. We can take this constraint, the constraint on y in terms of x and substitute it for y in this first blue equation and then solve for x. So let's try it out. So this first blue equation would then become -3x-4 but instead of putting a y there the second constraint tells us that y needs to be equal to 2x-5. So it's 4(2x-5) and all of that is going to be equal to -2. So now we get just one equation with one unknown. and now we just have to solve for x. So, let's see if we can do that. So, it's -3x and then this part right over here we have a -4, be careful, we have a -4 we want to distribute. We are going to multiply -4*2x which is -8x and -4*-5 is positive 20 and thats going to equal -2. And now we can combine all the x terms so -3x-8x, that's going to be -11x and then we have -11x+20=-2. Now to solve for x, we'll subtract 20 from both sides to get rid of the 20 on the left hand side. On the left hand side, we're just left with the -11x and then on the right hand side we are left with -22. Now we can divide both sides by -11. And we are left with x is equal to 22 divided by 11 is 2, and the negatives cancel out. x = 2. So we are not quite done yet. We've done, I guess you can say the hard part, we have solved for x but now we have to solve for y. We could take this x value to either one of these equations and solve for y. But this second one has already explicitly solved for y so let's use that one, so it says y = 2 times and instead of x, we now know that the x value where these two intersect, you could view it that way is going to be equal to 2, so 2 * 2 - 5 let's figure out the corresponding y value. So you get y=2(2)-5 and y = 4 - 5 so y = -1. And you can verify that it'll work in this top equation If y = -1 and x=2, this top equation becomes -3(2) which is -6-4(-1) which would be plus 4. And -6+4 is indeed -2. So it satisfies both of these equations and now we can type it in to verify that we got it right, although, we know that we did, so x=2 and y=-1. So, let's type it in... x=2 and y=-1. Excellent, now we're much less likely to be embarassed by talking birds. \",\n",

So these are the\\ntwo things that we need to figure out\\nbecause then we can know how many adults\\nand children are coming to the next branch that are\\nbeing held in your honor and get the exact right\\nnumber of cupcakes. So those are things you're\\ntrying to figure out. And we don't know\\nwhat those things are. Let's define some variables\\nthat represent those things. Well let's do a for adults. Let's let a equal the\\nnumber of cupcakes that, on average,\\neach adult eats. And let's do c for children. So c is the number of cupcakes\\nfor a child on average. So given that\\ninformation, let's see how we can represent what the\\nKing has told us algebraically. So let's think about this\\norange information first. How could we represent\\nthis algebraically? Well let's think about\\nhow many cupcakes the adults ate at that party. You had 500 adults, and\\non average, each of them exactly a cupcakes. So the total number of\\ncupcakes that the adults ate were 500 times a. How many did the children eat? Well same logic. You had 200 children and\\nthey each ate c cupcakes. So 200 times c is the\\ntotal number of cupcakes that the children ate. Well how much did\\nthey eat in total? Well it's the total\\nnumber that the adults ate plus the total number\\nthat the children ate which is 2,900 cupcakes. So let's do that and apply that\\nsame logic to the blue party right over here, this\\nblue information. How can we represent\\nthis algebraically? Well once again, how many total\\ncupcakes did the adults eat? Well, you had 500\\nadults and they each ate a cupcakes, which\\nis an unknown right now. And then what\\nabout the children? Well you had 300 children\\nand they each ate c cupcakes. And so if you add\\nup all the cupcakes that the adults ate plus all the\\ncupcakes that the children ate, you get to 3,100 cupcakes. So this is starting\\nto look interesting. I have two equations. I have a system of two\\nequations with two unknowns. And you know from your\\nexperience with the troll that you should be\\nable to solve this. You could solve it graphically\\nlike you did in the past, but now you feel\\nthat there could be another tool in your\\ntool kit which is really just an application of the\\nalgebra that you already know. So think a little bit about\\nhow you might do this. So let's rewrite this first\\nequation right over here. So we have 500a plus 200c\\nis equal to 2,900 cupcakes. Now, it would be good if we\\ncould get rid of this 500a somehow. Well you might say, well\\nlet me just subtract 500a. So you might say, oh, I\\njust want to subtract 500a. But if you subtracted 500a\\nfrom the left hand side, you'd also have to subtract\\n500a from the right hand side. And so the a wouldn't\\njust disappear. It would just end up\\non the right hand side, and you would still\\nhave one equation with two unknowns which\\nisn't too helpful. But you see something\\ninteresting. You're like, well\\nthis is a 500a here. What if I subtracted\\na 500a and this 300c? So if I subtracted\\nthe 500a and the 300c from the left hand side. And you're like, well\\nwhy is that useful? You're going to do the same\\nthing on the right hand side and then you're going to have\\nan a and a c on the right hand. And you just say, hold on,\\nhold on one second here. Hold on, I guess you're\\ntalking to yourself. Hold on one second. I'm subtracting the left\\nhand side of this equation, but this left hand side\\nis the exact same thing as this right hand side. So here I could\\nsubtract 500a and 300c, and I could do 500a and\\nsubtract 300c over here. But we know that\\nsubtracting 500a and 300c, that's the exact same\\nthing as subtracting 3,100. Let me make it clear. This is 500a minus 300c\\nis the exact same thing as subtracting 500a plus 300c. And we know that 500a plus\\n300c is exactly 3,100. This is 3,100. This is what the second\\ninformation gave us. So instead of subtracting\\n500a and minus 300c, we can just subtract 3,100. So let me do that. This is exciting. So let me clear that out. So let's clear that out. And so here, instead\\nof doing this, I can subtract the exact same\\nvalue, which we know is 3,100, subtract 3,100. So looking at it\\nthis way, it looks like we're subtracting\\nthis bottom equation from the top equation, but\\nwe're really just subtracting the same thing from both sides. This is just very\\nbasic algebra here. But if we do that,\\nlet's see what happens. So on the left hand side, 500a\\nminus 500a, those cancel out. 200c minus 300c, that\\ngives us negative 100c. And on the right hand\\nside, 2,900 minus 3,100 is negative 200. Well now we have one\\nequation with one unknown, and we know how to solve this. We can divide both\\nsides by negative 100. These cancel out. And then over here, you\\nend up with a positive 2. So c is equal to positive 2. So we've solved one\\nof the unknowns, the each child on\\naverage drinks two cups. So c is equal to 2. So how can we figure\\nout what a is? Well now we can take\\nthis information and go back into either one\\nof these and figure out what a has to be. So let's go back into the\\norange one right over here and figure out what a has to be. So we had 500a plus 200c, but\\nwe know what c is, c is 2. So 200 times 2 is\\nequal to 2,900. And now we just\\nhave to solve for a, one equation with one unknown. So we have 500a,\\n200 times 2 is 400, plus 400 is equal to 2,900. We can subtract 400 from\\nboth sides of this equation. Let me do that. Subtracting 400, and we are\\nleft with this cancels out. And on the left hand\\nside, we have 500a. This is very exciting. We're in the home stretch. On the right hand\\nside, you have 2,500. 500a equals 2,500. We can divide both\\nsides by 500, and we are left with 2,500\\ndivided by 500 is just 5. So you have a is equal\\nto 5 and you're done. You have solved the\\nKing's conundrum. Each child on average drinks\\n2 cups of water-- sorry, not cups of water. I don't know where\\nI got that from. Each child 2 cupcakes and each\\nadult will eat 5 cupcakes. a is equal to 5. And so based on how many\\nadults and children are coming to the brunch in\\nyour honor, you now know exactly the\\nnumber of cupcakes that the King needs to order. \",\n",
       " '6.3.2': \"- [Instructor] We're asked\\nwhich of these strategies would eliminate a variable in the system of equations? Choose all answers that apply. So this first one says add the equations. So pause this video. Would adding the equations\\neliminate a variable in this system? All right, now let's do it together. So if we add these equations, we have, on the left hand side, we have five x plus five x, which is going to be 10 x, and then you have negative\\nthree y plus four y which is just a positive\\none y or just plus y is equal to negative three plus six, which is just going to be\\nequal to positive three. We haven't eliminated any variables, so choice A, I could rule out. That did not eliminate a variable. Let me cross it out and not check it. Subtract the bottom equation from the top. Well when we subtract\\nthe bottom from the top, five x minus five x, that's going to be zero x's,\\nso I won't even write it down, and we've already seen\\nwe've eliminated an x so I'm already feeling\\ngood about choice B, but then we can see negative\\nthree y minus four y is negative seven y. Negative three minus six is\\ngoing to be negative nine and so choice B does\\nsuccessfully eliminate the x's. So I will select that. Choice C, multiply the\\ntop equation by two, then add the equations. Pause the video. Does that eliminate a variable? Well we're gonna multiply\\nthe top equation by two so it's going to become 10 x minus six y is equal to negative six, and you could already see if\\nyou then add the equations, 10 x plus five x, you're gonna have 15 x, that's not gonna get eliminated. Negative six y plus four\\ny is negative two y. That's not going to be eliminated, so we can rule that out, as well. Let's do another example. One, they're asking us the same question. Which of these strategies\\nwould eliminate a variable in the system of equations? The first choice says multiply\\nthe bottom equation by two, then add the equations. Pause this video, does that work? All right, so if we multiply\\nthe bottom equation by two, we are going to get, if we multiply it by two, we're gonna get two x minus\\ntwo minus four y, I should say. Two x, I'm just multiplying\\neverything by two, minus four y is equal to 10. And then if we were to add the equations. Four x plus two x is six x, so that doesn't get eliminated. Positive four y plus negative\\nfour y is equal to zero y, so the y's actually do get eliminated when you add four y to negative four y. So I like choice A and\\nI'm gonna delete this so I have space to work\\non the other choices, so I like one. What about choice B? Pause the video, does that work? Multiply the bottom equation by four, then subtract the bottom\\nequation from the top equation. All right, let's multiply\\nthe bottom equation by four. What do we get? We're going to get four x minus eight y is equal to 20, yup. We multiplied it by four and then subtract the bottom\\nequation from the top. So we would subtract four x from four x. Well that's looking good. That would eliminate the x's, so I'm feeling good about choice B. And then we could see if we\\nsubtract negative eight y from four y, well, subtracting\\na negative's the same thing as adding a positive, so that would actually get us to 12 y if we're subtracting\\nnegative eight y from four y. And then if we subtract\\n20 from negative two, we get to negative 22, but we see that four x minus four x is going to eliminate our x's, so that does definitely\\neliminate a variable, so I like choice B. Now what about choice C? Multiply the top equation by 1/2, then add the equations. Let's try that out, pause the video. All right, let's just multiply times 1/2, so the left hand side times 1/2, we distribute the one half\\nis one way to think about it. Four x times 1/2 is going to be two x plus four y times 1/2 is two y is equal to negative two times 1/2 is equal to negative one. Now and then they say add the equations. So two x plus x is going to be three x, so that's not going to eliminate the x's. Two y plus negative two y, well that's going to be no y's. So that actually will eliminate the y's, so I like this choice, as well. So actually, all three of these strategies would eliminate a variable\\nin the system of equations. This is useful to see 'cause you can see there's\\nmultiple ways to approach solving a system like\\nthis through elimination. Let's do another example. Which of these strategies\\nwould eliminate a variable in the system of equations? Same question again. So the first one, they suggest to subtract\\nthe bottom equation from the top equation. Pause this video, does that work? Well if we subtract the\\nbottom from the top, so if you subtract a negative two x, that's the same thing as adding two x, 'cause you're adding two x\\nto three x, that's five x. The x's don't get eliminated. Subtracting four y from negative\\nthree y's just gonna get us to negative seven y. The y's don't get eliminated, so I would rule this one out. Nothing's getting eliminated there. Multiply the top equation by three, multiply the bottom equation by two, then add the equations. Pause the video, does that work? All right, so if I multiply\\nthe top equation by three, I'm going to get nine x minus nine y is equal to 21, and then if I multiply the bottom by two, so this is times two, I'm going to get two times\\nnegative two is negative four x plus eight y is equal to 14, and then they say add the equations. Well if I add nine x to negative four x, that doesn't eliminate the x's. That gets me to positive five x, and if I add negative nine\\ny to a positive eight y, that also doesn't eliminate the y's. That gets me to a negative y, so choice B, I can also rule out. Once again deleting all of this so I have space to try\\nto figure out choice C. Multiply the top equation by two, multiply the bottom equation by three, then add the equation. So they're telling us to\\ndo it the other way around. Pause the video, does this work? All right, so we multiply\\nthe top equation by two and we're gonna multiply the\\nbottom equation by three. So the top equation times two is going to be six x minus six y is equal to, is equal to 14. And then with this bottom equation, when you multiply it by three, both sides, that's the only way to\\nensure that the equation is saying the same thing\\nis if you do the same thing to both sides. That's really the heart of algebra. So negative two times\\nthree is negative six x, and I already like where this is going, 'cause when I add these two, they're going to get eliminated, plus four y times three\\nis gonna be plus 12 y is going to be equal to 21. And then they say add the equations, well, you immediately see\\nwhen you add the x terms on the left hand side, they are going to cancel out. So I like choice C. \",\n",
       " '6.3.3': \"- [Instructor] So we have a system of two linear equations here. This first equation, X minus\\nfour Y is equal to negative 18, and the second equation,\\nnegative X plus three Y is equal to 11. Now what we're gonna do\\nis find an X and Y pair that satisfies both of these equations. That's what solving the\\nsystem actually means. As you might already have seen, there's a bunch of X and Y pairs that satisfy this first equation. In fact, if you were to graph them, they would form a line, and there's a bunch of other X and Y pairs that satisfy this other equation, the second equation, and if you were to graph them, it would form a line. And so if you find the X and\\nY pair that satisfy both, that would be the\\nintersection of the lines, so let's do that. So actually, I'm just gonna rewrite the first equation over here, so I'm gonna write X minus four Y is equal to negative 18. So, we've already seen in algebra that as long as we do the same thing to both sides of the equation, we can maintain our equality. So what if we were to add, and our goal here is to\\neliminate one of the variables so we have one equation with one unknown, so what if we were to add this negative X plus three Y\\nto the left hand side here? So negative X plus three Y, well, that looks pretty good because an X and a negative\\nX are going to cancel out, and we are going to be left with negative four Y, plus three Y. Well, that's just going to be negative Y. So by adding the left hand side of this bottom equation\\nto the left hand side of the top equation, we were able to cancel out the Xs. We had X, and we had a negative X. That was very nice for us. So what do we do on the right hand side? We've already said that we have to add the same thing to both\\nsides of an equation. We might be tempted to just say, well, if I\\nhave to add the same thing to both sides, well, maybe I have to add a negative X plus three Y to that side. But that's not going to help us much. We're gonna have negative\\n18 minus X plus three Y. We would have introduced an X on the right hand side of the equation, but what if we could add something that's equivalent to\\nnegative X plus three Y that does not introduce the X variable? Well, we know that the number 11 is equivalent to negative X plus three Y. How do we know that? Well, that second equation tells us that. So once again, all I'm doing\\nis I'm adding the same thing to both sides of that top equation. On the left, I'm expressing\\nit as negative X plus three Y, but the second equation tells us that negative X plus three Y is going to be equal to 11. It's introducing that second constraint, and so let's add 11 to\\nthe right hand side, which is, once again, I\\nknow I keep repeating it, it's the same thing as\\nnegative X plus three Y. So negative 18 plus 11 is negative seven, and since we added the\\nsame thing to both sides, the equality still holds, and we get negative Y is\\nequal to negative seven, or divide both sides by negative one or multiply both sides by negative one. So multiply both sides by negative one. We get Y is equal to seven, so we have the Y coordinate of the X, Y pair that\\nsatisfies both of these. Now how do we find the X? Well, we can just substitute\\nthis Y equals seven to either one of these. When Y equals seven, we\\nshould get the same X regardless of which equation we use. So let's use the top equation. So we know that X minus four times, instead of writing Y, I'm gonna write four times seven 'cause we're gonna figure out what is X when Y is seven? That is going to be equal to negative 18, and so let's see, negative\\nfour or four times seven. That is 28. So let's see, I could just solve for X. I could add 28 to both sides, so add 28 to both sides. On the left hand side, negative 28, positive\\n28, those cancel out. I'm just left with an X, and on the right hand side, I get negative 18 plus 28 is 10. So there you have it. I have the X, Y pair that satisfies both. X equals 10. Y equals seven. I could write it here. So I could write it as coordinates. I could write it as 10 comma seven, and notice, what I just did here, I encourage you. Substitute Y equals seven here, and you would also get X equals 10. Either way, you would\\nhave come to X equals 10, and to visualize what is going on here, let's visualize it really fast. Let me draw some coordinate axes. Whoops, I meant to draw a\\nstraighter line than that. Alright, there you go, so let's say that is our Y axis, and that is, whoops, that is our X axis, and then, let's see, the top equation is gonna\\nlook something like this. It's gonna look something like this, and then that bottom equation is gonna look something like, lemme draw a little bit nicer than that. It's going to look something like this, something like that. Lemme draw that bottom one here so you see the point of intersection, and so the point of\\nintersection right over here, that is an X, Y pair that satisfies both of these equations, and that we just saw, it happens when X is equal to 10, and Y is equal to seven. Once again, this white line, that's all the X and Y pairs that satisfy the top equation. This orange line, that's\\nall the X and Y pairs that satisfy the orange equation, and where they intersect, that point is on both lines. It satisfies both equations, and once again, take X equals 10, Y equals seven. Substitute it back into\\neither one of these, and you will see that it holds. \",\n",
       " '6.3.4': \"Everyone in the kingdom is very\\nimpressed with your ability to help with the party\\nplanning, everyone except for this gentlemen\\nright over here. This is Arbegla. And he is the\\nking's top adviser, and also chief party planner. And he seems somewhat\\nthreatened by your ability to solve these otherwise\\nunsolvable problems, or at least from\\nhis point of view, because he keeps over-ordering\\nor under-ordering things like cupcakes. And he says, king, that\\ncupcake problem was easy. Ask them about the\\npotato chip issue, because we could never get\\nthe potato chips right. And so the king says,\\nArbegla, that's a good idea. We need to get the\\npotato chips right. So he comes to you\\nand says, how do we figure out, on average, how many\\npotato chips we need to order? And to do that, we\\nhave to figure out how much, on average,\\ndoes each man eat and how much each woman eats. You say, well, what\\nabout the children? The king says, in\\nour kingdom, we forbid potato\\nchips for children. You say, oh, well,\\nthat's all and good. Tell me what happened\\nat the previous parties. And so the king says, you might\\nremember, at the last party, in fact, the last two\\nparties, we had 500 adults. At the last party, 200 of\\nthem were men, and 300 of them were women. And in total, they ate\\n1,200 bags of potato chips. And you say, what about\\nthe party before that? He says, that one, we had a\\nbigger skew towards women. We only had 100 men,\\nand we have 400 women. And that time, we\\nactually had fewer bags consumed-- 1,100\\nbags of potato chips. So you say, OK, king\\nand Arbegla, this seems like a fairly\\nstraightforward thing. Let me define some variables\\nto represent our unknowns. So you go ahead\\nand you say, well, let's let m equal the number\\nof bags eaten by each man. And you could think\\nof it on average, or maybe all the\\nmen in that kingdom are completely identical. Or maybe it's the average number\\nof bags eaten by each man. And let's let w equal the number\\nof bags eaten by each woman. And so with these\\ndefinitions of our variables, let's think about\\nhow we can represent this first piece of information,\\nthis piece of information in green. Well, let's think about\\nthe total number of bags that the men ate. You had 200 men. Let me scroll over a little bit. You had 200 men, and they each\\nate m bags, m bags per man. So the men at this\\nfirst party collectively ate 200 times m bags. If m is 10 bags per man,\\nthen this would be 2,000. If m was 5 bags per man,\\nthen this would be 5,000. We don't know what m\\nis, but 200 times m is the total eaten by the men. Same logic-- total\\neaten by the women is 300 women times the number\\nof bags eaten by each woman. And so if you add the total to\\neaten by the men and the women, you get the 1,200 bags. So this is information,\\nwritten algebraically, given these variable\\ndefinitions. Now, let's do the same\\nthing with the second part of the information that they\\ngave us right over here. Let's think about how we can\\nrepresent this algebraically. Well, similar logic--\\nwhat was a total that the men ate at that party? It was 100 men times\\nm bags per man. And we're assuming that m\\nis the same across parties, that men, on average, always\\neat the same number of bags. And how many did the women\\neat at that second party? Well, you had 400 women. And on average, they\\nate w bags per woman. So this is 400 times\\nw is the total number that the women ate. You add those two together,\\nyou get the total number that all the adults ate. So this is going\\nto be 1,100 bags. So it looks pretty similar now. You have a system of two\\nequations with two unknowns. And so you try your\\nbest to solve it. But when you solve it, you\\nsee something interesting. Last time, it was\\nvery convenient. You had a, I think it was\\na 500 here, for 500 adults, and you had another 500. And so it seemed\\nlike it was pretty easy to cancel out\\none of the variables. Here it seems a little\\nbit more difficult. What's multiplying by the\\nm's, it's different here. The coefficient on the w\\nis different over here. You say, well, maybe I can\\nchange one of these equations so it makes it a little\\nbit easier to cancel out with the other equation. So what if, for example, I\\nwere to take this blue equation right over here and\\nmultiply it by negative 2? And you might say,\\nwell, Sal, why are we multiplying it by negative 2? Well, if were to multiply\\nit by negative 2, this 100m would become\\na negative 200m. And if it was a\\nnegative 200m, then that would cancel out\\nwith a positive 200m when we add the two. So let's see what happens. So let's multiply this blue\\nequation by negative 2. We're going to\\nmultiply by negative 2. Let me scroll over to\\nthe left a little bit. So what happens? Remember, when we\\nmultiply an equation, we can't just do one\\nside of the equation. We have to do the\\nentire equation in order for the equality to hold true. So negative 2 times\\n100m is negative 200m. Negative 2 times 400w-- there's\\na positive right over there. So it becomes negative 800w. And then negative 2-- now,\\nwe did the left hand side, but we also have to do\\nthe right hand side. Negative 2 times 1,100\\nis negative 2,200. So just to be\\nclear, this equation that I just wrote\\nhere essentially has the same information\\nwe just manipulated. We just changed this equation,\\nmultiplied both sides by negative 2. But it's kind of\\nthe same constraint. But what makes this\\ninteresting is, now, we can rewrite\\nthis green equation. Let me do it over\\nhere, this first one. 200m plus 300w is\\nequal to 1,200. And the whole reason why\\nI multiplied by negative 2 is, so that if I were\\nto add these two things, I might be able to get rid\\nof that variable over there. And so let's do that. Let's add the left hand sides,\\nand let's add the right hand sides. And you could literally\\nview it as, we're starting with this\\nblue equation. We're adding this\\nquantity, the left hand side of the yellow equation to\\nthe left hand side of the blue. And then 1,200 is\\nthe exact same thing that we're adding to\\nthe right hand side. We know that this\\nis equal to this. So we can add this to the\\nleft hand side and this to the right hand side. So let's see what happens. So the good thing is,\\nthe whole reason we multiplied it by negative\\n2, so that these two characters cancel out. You add those two together. You just get 0m or just 0. You have negative\\n800w plus 300w. Well, that's negative 500w. And then on the\\nright hand side, you have negative 2,200 plus 1,200. So that's negative 1,000. And now this is pretty\\nstraightforward-- one equation, one unknown,\\na fairly straightforward equation. We divide both sides by\\nthe coefficient of w, multiplying w. So divide by negative 500 on\\nthe left, divide by negative 500 on the right. And we are left with\\nw is equal to 2. On average, women ate\\ntwo bags of potato chips at these parties. We're assuming that's\\nconstant across the parties. So let's think about how\\nyou would then figure out how many bags, on\\naverage, each man ate. Well, to do that,\\nwe just go back to either one of\\nthese equations. In the last set of videos, I\\nwent to the first equation. I'll show that the second\\nequation should also work. Either one should work. So let's substitute back\\ninto the second equation. And you could either pick this\\nversion of it or this one. But I'll pick the original one. So you have 100\\ntimes m, which we're trying to figure out,\\nplus 400 times-- well, we now know that w is\\nequal to 2-- 400 times 2 is equal to 1,100. So you have 100m plus\\n800 is equal to 1,100. And now, to solve for\\nm, we could subtract 800 from both sides. And we are left with\\n100m is equal to 300. And now, divide\\nboth sides by 100. And we are left with m, which\\nis, on average, the number of bags of chips each\\nman eats is equal to 3. So you have solved\\nArbegla's problem, what he thought was a\\ndifficult problem, using the magical, mystical\\npowers of algebra. You were able to tell the king\\nin his party planning process that, on average,\\nthe men will eat three bags of potato chips each. And on average,\\nthe women will eat two bags of potato chips each. \",\n",
       " '6.3.5': \"Let's solve a few more systems\\nof equations using elimination, but in these it\\nwon't be kind of a one-step elimination. We're going to have to massage\\nthe equations a little bit in order to prepare them\\nfor elimination. So let's say that we have an\\nequation, 5x minus 10y is equal to 15. And we have another equation,\\n3x minus 2y is equal to 3. And I said we want to do\\nthis using elimination. Once again, we could use\\nsubstitution, we could graph both of these lines and figure\\nout where they intersect. But we're going to\\nuse elimination. But the first thing you might\\nsay, hey, Sal, you know, with elimination, you were\\nsubtracting the left-hand side of one equation from another,\\nor adding the two, and then adding the two right-hand\\nsides. And I could do that, because it\\nwas essentially adding the same thing to both sides\\nof the equation. But here, it's not\\nobvious that that would be of any help. If we added these two left-hand\\nsides, you would get 8x minus 12y. That wouldn't eliminate\\nany variables. And on the right-hand\\nside, you would just be left with a number. And if you subtracted,\\nthat wouldn't eliminate any variables. So how is elimination\\ngoing to help here? And the answer is, we can\\nmultiply both of these equations in such a way that\\nmaybe we can get one of these terms to cancel out with\\none of the others. And you could really\\npick which term you want to cancel out. Let's say we want to cancel out\\nthe y terms. So I'll just rewrite this 5x minus\\n10y here. 5x minus 10y is equal to 15. Now, is there anything that\\nI can multiply this green equation by so that this\\nnegative 2y term becomes a term that will cancel out\\nwith the negative 10y? So I essentially want to make\\nthis negative 2y into a positive 10y. Right? Because if this is a positive\\n10y, it'll cancel out when I add the left-hand sides\\nof this equation. So what can I multiply\\nthis equation by? Well, if I multiply it by\\nnegative 5, negative 5 times negative 2 right here would\\nbe positive 10. So let's do that. Let's multiply this equation\\ntimes negative 5. So you multiply the left-hand\\nside by negative 5, and multiply the right-hand\\nside by negative 5. And what do you get? Remember, we're not\\nfundamentally changing the equation. We're not changing the\\ninformation in the equation. We're doing the same thing\\nto both sides of it. So the left-hand side of the\\nequation becomes negative 5 times 3x is negative 15x. And then negative 5 times\\nnegative 2y is plus 10y, is equal to 3 times negative\\n5 is negative 15. And now, we're ready to\\ndo our elimination. If we add this to the left-hand\\nside of the yellow equation, and we add the\\nnegative 15 to the right-hand side of the yellow equation, we\\nare adding the same thing to both sides of the equation. Because this is equal to that. So let's do that. So 5x minus 15y-- we have this\\nlittle negative sign there, we don't want to lose that--\\nthat's negative 10x. The y's cancel out. Negative 10y plus\\n10y, that's 0y. That was the whole point behind\\nmultiplying this by negative 5. Is going to be equal to--\\n15 minus 15 is 0. So negative 10x is equal to 0. Divide both sides by negative\\n10, and you get x is equal to 0. And now we can substitute back\\ninto either of these equations to figure out what y\\nmust be equal to. Let's substitute into\\nthe top equation. So we get 5 times 0, minus\\n10y, is equal to 15. Or negative 10y is\\nequal to 15. Let me write that. Negative 10y is equal to 15. Divide both sides\\nby negative 10. And we are left with\\ny is equal to 15/10, is negative 3/2. So if you were to graph it,\\nthe point of intersection would be the point\\n0, negative 3/2. And you can verify that it also\\nsatisfies this equation. The original equation over\\nhere was 3x minus 2y is equal to 3. 3 times 0, which is 0, minus 2\\ntimes negative 3/2 is, this is 0, this is positive 3. Right? These cancel out, these\\nbecome positive. Plus positive 3 is equal to 3. So this does indeed satisfy\\nboth equations. Let's do another one of these\\nwhere we have to multiply, and to massage the equations, and\\nthen we can eliminate one of the variables. Let's do another one. Let's say we have 5x plus\\n7y is equal to 15. And we have 7-- let me do\\nanother color-- 7x minus 3y is equal to 5. Now once again, if you just\\nadded or subtracted both the left-hand sides, you're\\nnot going to eliminate any variables. These aren't in any way kind of\\nhave the same coefficient or the negative of their\\ncoefficient. So let's pick a variable\\nto eliminate. Let's say we want to eliminate\\nthe x's this time. And you could literally\\npick on one of the variables or another. It doesn't matter. You can say let's eliminate the\\ny's first. But I'm going to choose to eliminate the x's\\nfirst. And so what I need to do is massage one or both of\\nthese equations in a way that these guys have the same\\ncoefficients, or their coefficients are the negatives\\nof each other, so that when I add the left-hand sides, they're\\ngoing to eliminate each other. Now, there's nothing obvious--\\nI can multiply this by a fraction to make it equal\\nto negative 5. Or I can multiply this by a\\nfraction to make it equal to negative 7. But even a more fun thing to do\\nis I can try to get both of them to be their least\\ncommon multiple. I could get both\\nof these to 35. And the way I can do it is by\\nmultiplying by each other. So I can multiply this\\ntop equation by 7. And I'm picking 7 so that\\nthis becomes a 35. And I can multiply this bottom\\nequation by negative 5. And the reason why I'm doing\\nthat is so this becomes a negative 35. Remember, my point is I want\\nto eliminate the x's. So if I make this a 35, and if\\nI make this a negative 35, then I'm going to be all set. I can add the left-hand\\nand the right-hand sides of the equations. So this top equation, when you\\nmultiply it by 7, it becomes-- let me scroll up a little bit--\\nwe multiply it by 7, it becomes 35x plus 49y is equal\\nto-- let's see, this is 70 plus 35 is equal to 105. Right? 15 and 70, plus 35,\\nis equal to 105. That's what the top\\nequation becomes. This bottom equation becomes\\nnegative 5 times 7x, is negative 35x, negative 5 times\\nnegative 3y is plus 15y. The negatives cancel out. And then 5-- this isn't a\\nminus 5-- this is times negative 5. 5 times negative 5 is equal\\nto negative 25. Now, we can start with this top\\nequation and add the same thing to both sides, where that\\nsame thing is negative 25, which is also equal\\nto this expression. So let's add the left-hand\\nsides and the right-hand sides. Because we're really adding the\\nsame thing to both sides of the equation. So the left-hand side,\\nthe x's cancel out. 35x minus 35x. That was the whole point. They cancel out, and on the\\ny's, you get 49y plus 15y, that is 64y. 64y is equal to 105 minus\\n25 is equal to 80. Divide both sides by 64, and you\\nget y is equal to 80/64. And let's see, if you divide\\nthe numerator and the denominator by 8-- actually\\nyou could probably do 16. 16 would be better. But let's do 8 first,\\njust because we know our 8 times tables. So that becomes 10/8, and then\\nyou can divide this by 2, and you get 5/4. If you divided just straight\\nup by 16, you would've gone straight to 5/4. So y is equal to 5/4. Let's figure out what x is. So we can substitute either into\\none of these equations, or into one of the original\\nequations. Let's substitute into the\\nsecond of the original equations, where we had 7x\\nminus 3y is equal to 5. That was the original version of\\nthe second equation that we later transformed into this. So we get 7x minus 3 times y,\\ntimes 5/4, is equal to 5. Or 7x minus 15/4\\nis equal to 5. Let's add 15/4-- Oh, sorry,\\nI didn't do that right. This would be 7x minus 3 times\\n4-- Oh, sorry, that was right. What am I doing? 3 times is 15/4. Is equal to 5. Let's add 15/4 to both sides. And what do we get? The left-hand side just\\nbecomes a 7x. These guys cancel out. And that's going to be\\nequal to 5, is the same thing as 20/4. 20/4 plus 15/4. Or we get that-- let me scroll\\ndown a little bit-- 7x is equal to 35/4. We can multiply both sides by\\n1/7, or we could divide both sides by 7, same thing. Let's multiply both\\nsides by 1/7. The same thing as\\ndividing by 7. So these cancel out and you're\\nleft with x is equal to-- Here, if you divide 35\\nby 7, you get 5. You divide 7 by 7, you get 1. So x is equal to 5/4 as well. So the point of intersection of\\nthis right here is both x and y are going to\\nbe equal to 5/4. So if you looked at it as a\\ngraph, it'd be 5/4 comma 5/4. And let's verify that this\\nsatisfies the top equation. And if you take 5 times\\n5/4, plus 7 times 5/4, what do you get? It should be equal to 15. So this is equal to 25/4,\\nplus-- what is this? This is plus 35/4. Which is equal to 60/4, which\\nis indeed equal to 15. So it does definitely satisfy\\nthat top equation. And you could check out this\\nbottom equation for yourself, but it should, because we\\nactually used this bottom equation to figure out that\\nx is equal to 5/4. \",\n",
       " '6.4.1': 'so now we have a very very very interesting problem on the left hand side of the scale I have two different types of unknown masses one of these X masses and we know that they have the same identical mass, we call that identical each of them having a mass of X But then we have this other blue thing and that has a mass of Y, which isn\\'t necessarily going to be the same as the mass of X. We have two of these X\\'s and a Y.It seems like the total mass or it definitely is the case, their total mass balance it out to these 8 kg right over here. Each of these is 1kg block and balances them out. So the first question I\\'m going to ask you is, can you express this Mathematically? Can you express what we\\'re seeing here, the fact that this total mass balances out with this total mass. Can you express that mathematically? Well let\\'s just think about our total mass on this side. We have two masses of mass X so those two are gonna total at 2X, and then you have a mass of Y. So then you\\'re gonna have another Y. So the total mass on the left hand side. Alright let me re-write a little bit closer to the center. So,it doesn\\'t get too spread out. On the left hand side, I got 2X plus a mass of Y. That\\'s the total mass. The total mass on the left hand side is 2X plus Y, the total mass on the right hand side is just 8. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. It is equal to 8 And since we see that the scale is balance, this total mass must be equal to this total mass. So, we can write an equal sign there. Now my question to you is there anything we can do just based on the information that we have here to solve for either the mass X or for the mass Y. Is there anything that we can do. Well the simple answer is just with this information here, there\\'s actually very little. You might say that \"Oh well, let me take the Y from both sides\" You might take this Y block up. But if you take this Y block up you have to take away Y from this side and you don\\'t know what Y is. And if you think about it algebraically you might get rid of the Y here. Subtracting Y and you\\'re gonna subtract Y from this side too. So, you\\'re not gonna get rid of the Y. Same thing with the X\\'s, you actually don\\'t have enough information. Y depends on what X is,and X depends on what Y is. Lucky for us however,we do have some more of these blocks laying around. And what we do is we take one of these X blocks. And I stack it over here,and I also take one of the Y block and I stack it right over there. And then I keep adding all these ones until I balance these things out. So, I keep adding these ones. Obviously if I just place this, this will go down cause there\\'s nothing on that side. But I keep adding these blocks until it all balances out and I find that my scale balances once I have 5 kg on the right hand side So, once again let me ask you this information having X and Y on the left hand side and a 5kg on the right hand side And the fact that they are balance, how can we represent that mathematically? Well our total mass on the left hand side is X plus Y. And our total mass, let me right that once again a little bit closer to the center. It\\'s X plus Y on the left hand side and the right hand side I have 5 kg. I have 5kg. I have 5 kg on the right hand side. And we know that\\'s actually balance the scale. So these total masses must be equal to each other. And this information by itself, once again. There\\'s nothing I can do with it. I don\\'t know what X and Y. If Y is 4 maybe X is 1 or maybe X is 4, Y is 1. Who knows what these are. The interesting thing is we can actually use both of these information to figure out what X and Y actually is. And I\\'m giving you a few seconds to think about how we can approach this situation. Well think about it this way, we know that X plus Y is equal to 5. So if we were to get rid of an X and a Y on this side,on the left hand side of the equation. What would we have to get rid of on the right hand side of the, or if we know if we get rid of X and Y on the left hand side of the scale What would we get rid of the right hand side of the scale to take away the same mass? Well if we take away the X and Y on the left hand side, we know that an X plus Y is 5kg. So, we\\'ll just have to take 5kg from the right hand side. So, lets think about what that would do. Well then I\\'ll just have an X over here, I\\'ll just have some of these masses left over here.Then I would what X is. Now lets think about how we can represent that algebraically Essentially for taking an X and Y from the left hand side. If I\\'m taking an X and Y from the left hand side. I\\'m subtracting an X, and I\\'m subtracting an X. Actually let me think of it this way. I\\'m subtracting an X plus Y. I\\'m subtracting an X and Y on the left hand side. But then what am I gonna do on the right hand side? Well an X and a Y we know has a mass of 5. So we can subtract 5 from the right hand side. And the only way I\\'m gonna be able to do this is because of the information that we got from the second scale. So I can take away 5. So this is going to be equal to taking away 5. Taking away X and a Y is equal to taking away 5. And we know that because an X and a Y is equal to 5kg. And if we take away an X and a Y on the left hand side, what do we left with? Well this is gonna be the same thing. Let me rewrite this part. This, taking away an X and a Y is the same thing if you distribute the negative sign as taking away an X and taking away a Y. And so on the left hand side, we\\'re left with just 2X and we have taken away one of the X\\'s, we\\'re left just an X. And we had a Y and we\\'ve took away one of the Y. So we\\'re left with no Y. We see that visually, we\\'re left with just an X here. And what do we have on the right hand side? We had 8 and we know X and Y is equal to 5, so we took away 5. So to keep the scale balance. And so 8 minus 5 is going to be 3. 8 minus 5 is equal to 3 and just like that using this extra information we\\'re able to figure out that the mass of X is equal to 3. Now, one final question. We\\'re able to figure out the mass of X, can you figure out what the mass of Y is. Well we can go back to either one of these scales. Probably be simpler to go back to this one. We know that the mass of X plus the mass of Y is equal to 5. So we could say, one thing we know that X is now is equal to 3. We know that this is now a 3kg mass. We can rewrite this is 3 plus Y is equal to 5 Well now we say, we could take 3 away from both sides. if I take 3 away from the left hand side I just have to take 3 away from the right hand side to keep my scale balanced. And I\\'ll be left with the mass of Y is balance with a mass of 2 or Y is equal to 2. That\\'s an analogy of taking 3 from both sides of this equation. And on the left hand side, I\\'m just left with a Y and on the right hand side I\\'m just left with a 2. So, X is equal to 3kg and Y is equal to 2kg and what I encouraged you to do is verify that it made sense right up here. Figure out what the total mass on the left hand and the right hand or verify what the total mass right over here really was 8 to begin with. And you\\'ll see that 2Xs are gonna be 6kg plus my Y is 2kg that will balance 8kg. And 3 plus 2 was equal to 5. ',\n",
       " '6.4.2': '- [Voiceover] \"Vivek and Camila\\'s\\nteacher gave them a system \"of linear equations to solve. \"They each took a few steps that lead \"to the systems shown in the table below.\" So we have the teacher\\'s original system, what Vivek got after\\ndoing some operations, what Camila got after\\ndoing some operations. Which of them obtained a\\nsystem that is equivalent to the teacher\\'s system? So the first question\\nwe should ask ourselves is what does it mean to even\\nhave an equivalent system? For the sake of this\\nquestion, or for our purposes, an equivalent system is a system\\nthat has the same solution. So if there\\'s some X-Y pair that satisfies the teacher\\'s system that is the solution to the teacher\\'s system. Well Vivek\\'s system, we\\'re\\ngonna call it equivalent if it has the same solution. Similarly, if Camila\\'s\\nsystem has the same solution, then we\\'re gonna call it\\nequivalent to the teacher\\'s system. So let\\'s make some comparisons here. So first let\\'s look at Vivek. So his first equation\\nis actually unchanged from the teacher\\'s equation, is unchanged from the teacher\\'s equation, so any solution that meets\\nboth of these equations is for sure gonna meet this top equation because it\\'s literally the\\nsame as the top equation of the teacher, so that works out. Also look at the second one. The second one is definitely a\\ndifferent equation over here. We can check that it\\'s\\nnot just being multiplied by some number on both sides. To go from one to zero\\nif you were multiplying, you would have to multiply one times zero and then in order to\\nmaintain the equality, you would have to do that on both sides. But zero times this left-hand\\nside would have been zero, you would have gotten zero equals zero, so he didn\\'t just scale\\nboth sides by some number, looks like he did another operation. He probably looks like\\nhe\\'s adding or subtracting something to both sides, so let\\'s see how he could have gotten this right over here. So he took -4x plus 5y is equal to one. And it looks like from\\nthat he was able to get - 3x plus 7y is equal to zero. So let\\'s see what he had to do to do that. Let\\'s see, he would have had to, to go from -4x to -3x, he would have had to add an X, so I could just write\\nan X right over there. To go from 5y to 7y, he would have had to add 2y. So on the left-hand side,\\nhe would have to add X plus 2y. Notice we have an X plus\\n2y right over there. And on the right-hand side,\\nhe would have had to add or subtract a one, or add a negative one. Notice we see a negative\\none right over there. So what he essentially did is\\nhe added the left-hand sides of these two equations to\\nget this new left-hand side right over here, and he\\nadded the right-hand sides to get this new right-hand side. And that is a legitimate operation. This new equation that you got, this new linear equation,\\nit\\'s going to represent a different line than\\nthis one right over here, but the resulting system is\\ngoing to have the same solution. Why do we feel confident\\nthat the resulting system is going to have the same solution? Well for an X-Y pair that\\nsatisfies both of these equations, that\\'s what a solution would be, for that X-Y pair, X plus 2y is equal to negative one. So for that solution, we\\'re adding the same thing to both sides. We\\'re saying: \"Look,\\nI\\'m gonna add X plus 2y \"to the left-hand side. \"Well if I don\\'t wanna\\nchange the solution, \"I have to add the same thing\\nto the right-hand side.\" Well they\\'re telling us for\\nthe solution to this equation, X plus 2y is equal to negative one, so negative one is the\\nsame thing as X plus 2y for that solution, so\\nwe\\'re not gonna change the resulting solution of the system, so it\\'s a completely legitimate\\noperation what Vivek did is adding the left-hand sides and adding the right-hand sides to get this new second equation. That\\'s not going to change\\nthe solution of the system. In fact, that\\'s a technique we often use to eventually find the\\nsolution of a system. So now let\\'s look at Camila, or Camila. So her first equation is\\nactually the exact same equation as the teacher\\'s second equation. Now let\\'s see, her second equation, how does it relate possibly\\nto the first equation? So just looking at it offhand, it looks like it might just be, it looks like she just multiplied\\nboth sides times a number. And it looks like that\\nnumber, she clearly multiplied the right-hand side times negative eight. So times negative eight. Negative one times negative\\neight is positive eight. And it looks like she also multiplied the left-hand side by negative eight. Negative eight times X is -8X. Negative eight times 2y is -16y. So she just multiplied both\\nsides by the same value which actually doesn\\'t\\nchange the equation. This actually is going to be-- It changes it the way it looks, but it actually represents the same line. So this is definitely\\nstill an equivalent system. These are still the same constraints. You\\'re going to have the same solution. Whenever you\\'re dealing with systems, you\\'re not going to change\\nthe solution of the system as long as you either multiply\\nboth sides of an equation by a scaler, or you are adding\\nand subtracting the equations. When I say add or subtract the equations, you\\'re adding the left-hand\\nside to the left-hand side, adding the right-hand side\\nto the right-hand side like we had here, or subtracting\\nthe one from the other on the left-hand side and\\nif we subtract the bottom from the top on the left-hand and we subtract the bottom\\nfrom the top on the right-hand, it\\'s not going to change our solution. So both of them obtained a\\nsystem that is equivalent, meaning that it has the same solution as the teacher\\'s system. ',\n",
       " '6.4.3': \"- Scarlett and Hansol's teacher gave them a system of linear equations to solve. They each took a few steps that lead to the systems shown in the table below. So this is the teacher system. This is what Scarlett got\\nafter taking some steps. This is what Hansol got. Which of them obtained a system that is equivalent to\\nthe teacher's system? And just to remind ourselves, an equivalent system is a system that has, or at least for our purposes, is a system that has the same solution, or the same solution set. So if there is a certain xy that satisfies this system in order for Scarlett's\\nsystem to be equivalent it needs to have the same solution. So let's look at this. So Scarlett, let's see, let's see if we can match these up. So her second equation here, so this is interesting, her second equation 14x - 7y = 2 over here the teacher has an equation 14x - 7y = 7. So this is interesting because the ratio between x and y is the same, but then your constant term, the constant term is\\ngoing to be different. And I would make the claim that this alone tells you\\nthat Scarlett's system is not equivalent to the teacher. And you're saying, well,\\nhow can I say that? Well, these two equations if you were to write them into slope intercept form, you would see because the ratio between x and y, the x\\nand y terms is the same. You're going to have the same slope, but you're going to have\\ndifferent Y intercepts. In fact, we can actually solve for that. So this equation right over here we can write it as if we, let's see, if we subtract 14x from both sides you get -7y - 14, woops, -7y =, is equal to -14x + 7 and we could divide both sides by -7. You get y = 2x -1 so that's this... All I did is algebraically\\nmanipulate this. This is this line and I could even try to graph it so let's do that. So I'll draw a quick coordinate. This is just going to be very rough. Quick coordinate axis right over there, and then this line, this line would look something like this. So its y intercept is -1\\nand it has a slope of 2. So let me draw a line with a slope of, a line with a slope of 2 might look something like that. So that's this line right over here or this one right over there, and let's see. This one over here is going to be, if we do the same algebra, we're going to have - 7y = -14x + 2, or y = , I'm just\\ndividing everything by -7, 2x - 2/7 so this is going to look\\nsomething like this. Its y intercept is -2/7 so\\nit's like right over there. So this line is going\\nto look something like, I'm going to draw my best, my best attempt at drawing it, it's going to look something... Actually that's not quite right. It's going to look something like... I'll actually just start\\nit right over here. It's going to look something like, something like this. It's going to have the same slope, and obviously it goes in\\nthis direction as well. Actually, let me just draw that. So it's going to have the same slope, but at different y intercepts. That doesn't look right,\\nbut you get the idea. These two lines are parallel. So these two lines are parallel so any coordinate that satisfies this one is not going to satisfy this one. They have no points in common. They are parallel. That's the definition of parallel. Since this and this have\\nno points in common, there's no way that some solution set that satisfies this would satisfy this 'cause any xy that satisfies this can't satisfy this or vice versa. They're parallel. There are no points. These two things will never intersect. So Scarlett does not have\\nan equivalent system. Now what about Hansol? Well, we see Hansol has the same thing going on here. 5x - y, 5x - y, but then the constant term is different, -6, positive 3. So this and this also\\nrepresent parallel lines. Any xy pair that satisfies this, there's no way that it's\\ngoing to satisfy this. These two lines don't intersect. They are parallel. So Hansol's system is\\nnot equivalent either. \",\n",
       " '6.4.4': \"- [Sal] In a previous video, we talk about the notion of\\nequivalence with equations. And equivalence is just this notion that there's different ways of writing what our equivalent statements in algebra. And I can give some simple examples. I could say two x equals 10,\\nor I could say x equals five. These are equivalent equations. Why are they? Because an x satisfies one of them if and only if it satisfies the other. And you can verify that in both cases, x equals five is the only\\nx that satisfies both. Another set of equivalent\\nequations, you could have two x is equal to eight and x equals four. These two are equivalent equations. An x satisfies one if and only\\nif it satisfies the other. In this video, we're going\\nto extend our knowledge of equivalence to thinking\\nabout equivalent systems. And really, in your past\\nwhen you were solving systems of equations,\\nyou were doing operations assuming equivalence, but you might not have just been thinking about it that way. So let's give ourselves a system. So let's say this system tells us that there's some x y pair\\nwhere two times that x plus that y is equal to eight, and that x plus that y is equal to five. Now we can have an equivalent system if we replace either of these equations with an equivalent version. So for example, many of you when you look to try to solve this, you might say well, if this was a negative two x here, maybe I could eventually\\nadd the left side. And we'll talk about why that is an equivalence preserving operation. But in order to get a\\nnegative two out here, you'd have to multiply\\nthis entire equation times negative two. And so if you did that, if you\\nmultiplied both sides of this times negative two, times negative two, what you're going to get is negative two x minus two y is equal to negative 10. This equation and this\\nequation are equivalent. Why? Because any x y pair that\\nsatisfies one of them will satisfy the other, or\\nan x y pair satisfies one if and only if it satisfies the other. And so if I now think about the system, the system where I've\\nrewritten this second equation and my first equation is the same, this is an equivalent\\nsystem to our first system. So these, any x y pair, if an x y pair satisfies one of these systems, it's going to satisfy\\nthe other and vice versa. Now the next interesting\\nthing that you might realize, and if you were just trying to solve this, and this isn't an introductory\\nvideo in solving systems, so I'm assuming some familiarity with it, you've probably seen\\nsolving by elimination where you say okay, look,\\nif I can somehow add these, the left side to the left\\nside and the right side to the right side, these\\nx's will quote cancel out and then I'll just be left with y's. And we've done this before. You can kind of think you're\\ntrying to solve for y. But in this video, I\\nwant to think about why you end up with an equivalent system if you were to do that. And one way to think about it is what I'm going to do to create\\nan equivalent system here is I am going to keep my first equation, two x plus y is equal to eight. But then I'm gonna take my second equation and add the same thing to both sides. We know if you add or\\nsubtract the same thing to both sides of an equation, you get an equivalent equation. So I'm gonna do that over here. But it's gonna be a\\nlittle bit interesting. So if you had negative two x minus two y is equal to negative 10,\\nand what I want to do is I want to add eight to both sides. So I could do it like this. I could add eight to both sides. But remember, our system\\nis saying that both of these statements are true, that two x plus y is equal to eight and negative two x minus two\\ny is equal to negative 10. So instead of adding\\nexplicitly eight to both sides, I could add something that's equivalent to eight to both sides. And I know something that\\nis equivalent to eight based on this first equation. I could add eight, and I could do eight on the left hand side, or I\\ncould just add two x plus y. So two x plus y. Now I really want you, you\\nmight want to pause your video and say okay, how can I do this? Why is Sal saying that I'm adding the same thing to both sides? Because remember, when\\nwe're taking a system, we're assuming that both\\nof these need to be true. An x y pair satisfies one\\nequation if and only if, only if, if and only if\\nit satisfies the other. So here, we know that x, two x plus y needs to be equal to eight. So if I'm adding two x plus y to the left and I'm adding eight to the right, I'm really just adding\\neight to both sides, which is equivalence preserving. And when you do that, you\\nget, these negative two x and two x cancels out, you get negative y is equal to negative two. And so I can rewrite that second equation as negative y is equal to negative two. And I know what you're thinking. You're like wait, but I'm used to solving systems of equations. I'm used to just adding these two together and then I just have this one equation. And really, that's not super\\nmathematically rigorous because the other equation is still there. It's still a constraint. Oftentimes, you solve for one and then you quote substitute back in. But really, the both equations\\nare there the whole time. You're just rewriting\\nthem in equivalent ways. So once again, this system, this system, and this system are all equivalent. Any x y pair that\\nsatisfies one will satisfy all of them, and vice versa. And once again, we can continue to rewrite this in equivalent ways. That second equation, I can multiply both sides by negative one. That's equivalence preserving. And if I did that, then\\nI get, I haven't changed my top equation, two x\\nplus y is equal to eight. And on the second one,\\nif I multiply both sides by negative one, I get y is equal to two. Once again, these are\\nall equivalent systems. I know I'm, I sound\\nvery repetitive in this. But now, I can do another\\nthing to make this, to keep the equivalence\\nbut get a clearer idea of what that x y pair is. If we know that y is equal to two and we know that that's\\ntrue in both equations, remember, it is an and here. We're assuming there's x y, some x y pair that satisfies both. Two x plus y needs to be equal to eight and y is equal to two. Well that means up here where we see a y, we can write an equivalent system where instead of writing a y there, we could write a two because\\nwe know that y is equal to two. And so we can rewrite that top equation by substituting a two for y. So we could rewrite that as two\\nx plus two is equal to eight and y is equal to two. So this is an and right over there. It's implicitly there. And of course, we can\\nkeep going from there. I'll scroll down a little bit. I could write another\\nequivalent system to this by doing equivalence preserving operations on that top equation. What if I subtracted two from both sides of that top equation? It's still going to be\\nan equivalent equation. And so I could rewrite\\nit as, if I subtract two from both sides, I'm gonna\\nget two x is equal to six. And then that second\\nequation hasn't changed. Y is equal to two. So there's some x y pair\\nthat if it satisfies one, it satisfies the other, and vice versa. This system is equivalent to every system that I've written so far in\\nthis chain of operations, so to speak, and then of\\ncourse, this top equation, an equivalence preserving operation is to divide both sides by a non, the same nonzero value. And in this case, I could\\ndivide both sides by two. And then I would get, if\\nI divide the top by two, I would get x equals three,\\nand y is equal to two. And once again, this is a different way of thinking about it. All I'm doing is rewriting the same system in an equivalent way that just\\ngets us a little bit clearer as to what that x y pair actually is. In the past, you might've just, you know, just assumed that you can\\nadd both sides of an equation or do this type of elimination or do some type of substitution to just quote figure out the x and y. But really, you're rewriting the system. You're rewriting the\\nconstraints of the system in equivalent ways to\\nmake it more explicit what that x y pair is that satisfies both equations in the system. \",\n",
       " '6.5.1': 'The king\\'s advisor, Arbegla, is watching all of this discourse between you, the king, the bird. And he\\'s starting to feel a little bit jealous \\'cause he\\'s supposed to be the wise man in the kingdom, the king\\'s closest advisor. So he steps in and says, \"okay, so if you and this bird\" \"are so smart, how about you tackle the Riddle of the Fruit Prices?\" And the king says, \"Yes, that is something that we haven\\'t been able to figure out.\" \"The fruit prices. Arbegla, tell them the riddle of the fruit prices.\" And so Arbegla says, \"Well,\" \"we wanna keep track of how much our fruit costs, but we forgot\" \"to actually log how much it costs when we went to the market but we know how much in total we spent\" \"we know much we got. We know that one week ago, when we went to\" \"the fruit market, we bought two, two, pounds of\" \"apples, we bought two pounds of apples, and one pound of bananas.\" \"one pound, I guess, of bananans, bananas. And the total cost\" \"that, time, was three dollars, so there was three dollars, three dollars\" in total cost. And then when we went the time before that we went the time before that we bought six pounds of bananas or six pounds of apples I should say Six pounds of apples. And three pounds three pounds of bananas. Ba-nanas. And the total cost at that point was fifteen dollars. So what is the cost of apples and bananas? So you look at the bird: The bird looks at you, the bird whispers into the king\\'s ear, and the king says Well the bird says we\\'ll just start defining some variables here, so we\\'ll start expressing this thing algebraically So you go about doing that. What we want to figure out is the cost of apples and the cost of bananas. Per pound. So we set some variables. So let\\'s... let a= the cost cost of apples, apple per pound. Per pound And let\\'s let b = the cost of bananas. Ba-nanas. Bananas per pound. So how could we interpret this first information right here? Two pounds of apples and a pound of bananas cost $3. So how much are the apples going to cost? Well it\\'s going to cost 2, two pounds times the cost per pound, times a, that\\'s going to be the total cost of apples in this scenarios, and what\\'s the total cost of the banana? Well it\\'s one pound times the cost per pound. So, you\\'re just going to have b, that\\'s the total cost of the bananas, cause we know we bought one the total cost of the apples and bananas are going to be 2a+b and we know what that total cost is it is, it is $3. Now let\\'s do the same thing for the other time we went to the market. Simply Six pounds of apple, the total cost is going to be six pounds times A dollars per pound and the total cost of banas is going to be well we bought three poiund of bananas. and the cost per pound is b and so the total cost of apples and bananas this scenario is going to be = to 15 is going to be = to $15 so let\\'s think about how we might want to solve it we could use elimination we could use substitution whatever we want, we might do it graphically let\\'s try it first with elimination. so the first thing I might want to do is is maybe I want to eliminate let\\'s say I want to eliminate the a variable right over here so I have two a over here, I have six a over here so if I multiply this entire right equation by -3 then this 2a would become a -6a and then it might be able to cancel out with that so let me do that let me multiply this entire equation times -3 times negative three so -3 * 2a is -6a -3 * b is -3b and then -3 * 3 is -9 is -9 and now we can essentially add the two equations or essentially add the left side of this to the left side of that or the right side of this equation to the right side of that we\\'re essentially adding the same thing to both sides of this equation because we know this is equal to that So let\\'s do that let\\'s do it So on the left hand side, 6a and 6a cancel out. But something else interesting happens, the 3b and the 3b cancels out as well. So we\\'re just left with 0 on the left hand side. And on the right hand side, what do we have? 15 - 9 = 6. So we get this bizarre statement! All of our variables have gone away And we\\'re left with this bizarre nonsensical statement that 0 = 6, which we know is definitely not the case. So what\\'s going on over here? What\\'s going on? And then, you you you say, what\\'s going on and you look at the bird \\'cause the bird seems to be the most knowledgeable person in the room or at least the most knowledgeable vertebrate in the room. And so the bird whispers into the king\\'s ear and the king says, \"Well, he says that there\\'s no solution and you should at least try to graph it to see why.\" And you say, well, the bird seems to know what he\\'s talking about So let me attempt to graph these two equations and see what\\'s going on. And so what you do is, you take each of the equation and you like, when you graph it, you like to put it in kind of the y-intercept form or slope intercept form and so you do that, so you say, well let me solve both of these for b so if you want to solve this first equation for b you just subtract 2a from both sides if you subtract 2a from both sides of this first equation you get b is = to -2a + 3. Now solve this second equation for b. So the first thing you might wanna do is subtract 6a from both sides. So you would get, you would get, I\\'ll do it right over, let me do it right over here. You would get 3b, 3b is = to -6a plus 15 and then you can divide both sides by 3 you get b is = to -2a plus, plus 5. So the second equation, let me revert back to that other shade of green, is b is = to -2a plus 5. And we haven\\'t even graphed it yet, but it looks like something interesting is going on. They both have the exact same slope when you solve in terms, when you solve for b but they seem to have different, let\\'s call them, b-intercepts let\\'s graph it to actually see what\\'s going on so let me get, draw some axes over here, let\\'s call that my b-axis and then this could be my, a axis And this first equation has a b-intercept of positive 3 so let\\'s see, one, two, three four five the first one has a b-intercept of positive three and it has a slope of negative 2 So you go down or you go to the right one you go down two. Go to the right one, you go down two. So the line looks something like this. I\\'m trying my best to draw it straight. So it looks it looks something something like that And I\\'ll just draw this green one. This green one, our b-intercept is 5 so it\\'s right over here. but we have the exact same slope the slope of -2, so it looks it looks something something like that right over there and you immediately see now that the bird was right There is no solution because these two constraints represent or can be represented by lines that don\\'t intersect. So the lines don\\'t, don\\'t intersect. In-ter-sect. They don\\'t intersect, and so the bird is right there\\'s no solution, there\\'s no x and y that can make this statement equal true! Or that can make 0 = 6, there is no possible, there is no overlap between these two things. And so something gets into your brain. You realize that Arbegla is trying to stump you. And you say, Arbegla, you have given me in-con-sistent information! This is an in-con-sistent system of equations! In. In...con...sistent. Which happens to be the word that is sometimes used to refer to a system that has no solutions, where the lines do not intersect. And there fore this information is incorrect We cannot assume that the apple or banana Either you are lying, which is possible, or you accounted for it wrong Or maybe the prices of apples and bananas actually changed between the two visits of the market. At which point the bird whispered into the King\\'s ear, and says, oh, this character isn\\'t so bad at this algebra stuff. ',\n",
       " '6.5.2': \"Arbegla starts to feel\\nangry and embarrassed that he was shown up by you and\\nthe bird in front of the King and so he storms\\nout of the room. And then a few seconds\\nlater he storms back in. He says, my fault. My apologies. I realize now what\\nthe mistake was. There was a slight, I guess,\\ntyping error or writing error. In the first week, when\\nthey went to the market and bought two pounds of apples\\nand one pound of bananas, it wasn't a $3 cost. It was a $5 cost. Now surely considering how smart\\nyou and this bird seem to be, you surely could figure out what\\nis the per pound cost of apples and what is the per\\npound cost of bananas. So you think for a\\nlittle bit, is there now going to be a solution? So let's break it down using\\nthe exact same variables. You say, well if a is the\\ncost of apples per pound and b is the cost of bananas,\\nthis first constraint tells us that two pounds of apples\\nare going to cost 2a, because it's b\\ndollars per pound. And one pound of\\nbananas is going to cost b dollars because\\nit's one pound times b dollars per pound is\\nnow going to cost $5. This is the corrected number. And we saw from\\nthe last scenario, this information hasn't changed. Six pounds of apples is\\ngoing to cost 6a, six pounds times a\\ndollars per pound. And three pounds of bananas is\\ngoing to cost 3b, three pounds times b dollars per pound. The total cost of the\\napples and bananas in this trip we\\nare given is $15. So once again, you\\nsay, well let me try to solve this maybe\\nthrough elimination. And once again, you say well\\nlet me cancel out the a's. I have 2a here. I have 6a here. If I multiply the 2a\\nhere by negative 3, then this will\\nbecome a negative 6a. And it might be able to cancel\\nout with all of this business. So you do that. You multiply this\\nentire equation. You can't just\\nmultiply one term. You have to multiply the entire\\nequation times negative 3 if you want the\\nequation to still hold. And so we're multiplying\\nby negative 3 so 2a times negative\\n3 is negative 6a. b times negative\\n3 is negative 3b. And then 5 times negative\\n3 is negative 15. And now something\\nfishy starts to look like it's about to happen. Because when you\\nadd the left hand side of this blue equation\\nor this purplish equation to the green one, you get 0. All of these things right\\nover here just cancel out. And on the right hand\\nside, 15 minus 15, that is also equal to 0. And you get 0 equals 0, which\\nseems a little bit better than the last time\\nyou worked through it. Last time we got 0 equals 6. But 0 equals 0 doesn't really\\ntell you anything about the x's and y's. This is true. This is absolutely true that\\n0 does definitely equals 0, but it doesn't tell you any\\ninformation about x and y. And so then the bird\\nwhispers in the King's ear, and then the King\\nsays, well the bird says you should graph\\nit to figure out what's actually going on. And so you've learned\\nthat listening to the bird actually makes a lot of sense. So you try to graph\\nthese two constraints. So let's do it the same way. We'll have a b axis. That's our b axis. And we will have our a axis. Let we mark off some markers\\nhere-- one, two, three, four, five and one, two,\\nthree, four, five. So this first equation\\nright over here, if we subtract 2a\\nfrom both sides, I'm just going to put it\\ninto slope intercept form, you get b is equal to\\nnegative 2a plus 5. All I did is subtract\\n2a from both sides. And if we were to graph\\nthat, our b-intercept when a is equal to 0,\\nb is equal to 5. So that's right over here. And our slope is negative 2. Every time you add 1 to a--\\nso if a goes from 0 to 1-- b is going to go down by 2. So go down by two, go down by 2. So this first white\\nequation looks like this if we graph the solution set. These are all of the prices\\nfor bananas and apples that meet this constraint. Now let's graph this\\nsecond equation. If we subtract 6a\\nfrom both sides, we get 3b is equal to\\nnegative 6a plus 15. And now we could divide\\nboth sides by 3, divide everything by 3. We are left with b is equal\\nto negative 2a plus 5. Well this is interesting. This looks very similar, or\\nit looks exactly the same. Our b-intercept is 5 and\\nour slope is negative 2a. So this is essentially\\nthe same line. So these are essentially\\nthe same constraints. And so you start to look at\\nit a little bit confused, and you say, OK, I see\\nwhy we got 0 equals 0. There's actually an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. You pick any x and then\\nthe corresponding y for each of these\\ncould be a solution for either of these things. So there's an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. But you start to wonder,\\nwhy is this happening? And so the bird whispers\\nagain into the King's ear and the King says,\\nwell the bird says this is because in both\\ntrips to the market the same ratio of apples\\nand bananas was bought. In the green trip\\nversus the white trip, you bought three times as many\\napples, bought three times as many bananas, and you\\nhad three times the cost. So in any situation for any\\nper pound prices of apples and bananas, if you\\nbuy exactly three times the number of apples, three\\ntimes the number bananas, and have three\\ntimes the cost, that could be true for any prices. And so this is actually\\nit's consistent. We can't say that\\nArbegla is lying to us, but it's not giving\\nus enough information. This is what we call, this\\nis a consistent system. It's consistent\\ninformation here. So let me write this down. This is consistent. And it is consistent,\\n0 equals 0. There's no shadiness\\ngoing on here. But it's not enough information. This system of\\nequations is dependent. It is dependent. And you have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. Any point this line\\nrepresents a solution. So you tell Arbegla,\\nwell, if you really want us to figure\\nthis out, you need to give us more information. And preferably buy a different\\nratio of apples to bananas. \",\n",
       " '6.5.3': \"Is the system of\\nlinear equations below consistent or inconsistent? And they give us x\\nplus 2y is equal to 13 and 3x minus y is\\nequal to negative 11. So to answer this\\nquestion, we need to know what it means to be\\nconsistent or inconsistent. So a consistent\\nsystem of equations. has at least one solution. And an inconsistent system of\\nequations, as you can imagine, has no solutions. So if we think about\\nit graphically, what would the graph of a\\nconsistent system look like? Let me just draw a\\nreally rough graph. So that's my x-axis,\\nand that is my y-axis. So if I have just two\\ndifferent lines that intersect, that would be consistent. So that's one line, and\\nthen that's another line. They clearly have\\nthat one solution where they both\\nintersect, so that would be a consistent system. Another consistent\\nsystem would be if they're the same\\nline, because then they would intersect at\\na ton of points, actually at an infinite\\nnumber of points. So let's say one of the\\nlines looks like that. And then the other line is\\nactually the exact same line. So it's exactly\\nright on top of it. So those two intersect at\\nevery point along those lines, so that also would\\nbe consistent. An inconsistent system\\nwould have no solutions. So let me again draw my axes. Let me once again draw my axes. It will have no solutions. And so the only way\\nthat you're going to have two lines\\nin two dimensions have no solutions is if\\nthey don't intersect, or if they are parallel. So one line could\\nlook like this. And then the other line\\nwould have the same slope, but it would be shifted over. It would have a\\ndifferent y-intercept, so it would look like this. So that's what an inconsistent\\nsystem would look like. You have parallel lines. This right here is inconsistent. So what we could do is\\njust do a rough graph of both of these lines\\nand see if they intersect. Another way to do it is,\\nyou could look at the slope. And if they have the same slope\\nand different y-intercepts, then you'd also have\\nan inconsistent system. But let's just graph them. So let me draw my x-axis\\nand let me draw my y-axis. So this is x and then this is y. And then there's a couple\\nof ways we could do it. The easiest way is really\\njust find two points on each of these that satisfy\\neach of these equations, and that's enough\\nto define a line. So for this first one, let's\\njust make a little table of x's and y's. When x is 0, you have\\n2y is equal to 13, or y is equal to 13/2, which\\nis the same thing as 6 and 1/2. So when x is 0, y is 6 and 1/2. I'll just put it\\nright over here. So this is 0 comma 13/2. And then let's just see\\nwhat happens when y is 0. When y is 0, then\\n2 times y is 0. You have x equaling 13. x equals 13. So we have the point 13 comma 0. So this is 0, 6 and\\n1/2, so 13 comma 0 would be right about there. We're just trying to\\napproximate-- 13 comma 0. And so this line right\\nup here, this equation can be represented by this line. Let me try my best to draw it. It would look\\nsomething like that. Now let's worry about this one. Let's worry about that one. So once again, let's make a\\nlittle table, x's and y's. I'm really just looking for\\ntwo points on this graph. So when x is equal to\\n0, 3 times 0 is just 0. So you get negative y\\nis equal to negative 11, or you get y is equal to 11. So you have the point 0, 11, so\\nthat's maybe right over there. 0 comma 11 is on that line. And then when y is 0,\\nyou have 3x minus 0 is equal to negative 11, or\\n3x is equal to negative 11. Or if you divide\\nboth sides by 3, you get x is equal\\nto negative 11/3. And this is the exact same\\nthing as negative 3 and 2/3. So when y is 0, you have x\\nbeing negative 3 and 2/3. So maybe this is about\\n6, so negative 3 and 2/3 would be right about here. So this is the point\\nnegative 11/3 comma 0. And so the second equation will\\nlook like something like this. Will look something like that. Now clearly-- and I might have\\nnot been completely precise when I did this hand-drawn\\ngraph-- clearly these two guys intersect. They intersect right over here. And to answer\\ntheir question, you don't even have to find the\\npoint that they intersect at. We just have to\\nsee, very clearly, that these two lines intersect. So this is a consistent\\nsystem of equations. It has one solution. You just have to have at least\\none in order to be consistent. So once again, consistent\\nsystem of equations. \",\n",
       " '6.5.4': \"Is the system of\\nlinear equations below dependent or independent? And they give us two\\nequations right here. And before I tackle\\nthis specific problem, let's just do a little\\nbit a review of what dependent or independent means. And actually, I'll compare that\\nto consistent and inconsistent. So just to start\\noff with, if we're dealing with systems of linear\\nequations in two dimensions, there's only three possibilities\\nthat the lines or the equations can have relative to each other. So let me draw the\\nthree possibilities. So let me draw three\\ncoordinate axes. So that's my first\\nx-axis and y-axis. Let me draw another one. That is x and that is y. Let me draw one\\nmore, because there's only three possibilities\\nin two dimensions. x and y if we're dealing\\nwith linear equations. So you can have the situation\\nwhere the lines just intersect in one point. Let me do this. So you could have\\none line like that and maybe the other line\\ndoes something like that and they intersect at one point. You could have the\\nsituation where the two lines are parallel. So you could have a situation--\\nactually let me draw it over here-- where you have one\\nline that goes like that and the other line has the\\nsame slope but it's shifted. It has a different y-intercept,\\nso maybe it looks like this. And you have no points\\nof intersection. And then you could\\nhave the situation where they're actually the same\\nline, so that both lines have the same slope and\\nthe same y-intercept. So really they\\nare the same line. They intersect on an\\ninfinite number of points. Every point on\\neither of those lines is also a point\\non the other line. So just to give you a little\\nbit of the terminology here, and we learned this in the\\nlast video, this type of system where they don't intersect,\\nwhere you have no solutions, this is an inconsistent system. And by definition, or\\nI guess just taking the opposite of\\ninconsistent, both of these would be considered consistent. But then within consistent,\\nthere's obviously a difference. Here we only have one solution. These are two different lines\\nthat intersect in one place. And here they're essentially\\nthe same exact line. And so we differentiate\\nbetween these two scenarios by calling this one\\nover here independent and this one over\\nhere dependent. So independent-- both lines\\nare doing their own thing. They're not dependent\\non each other. They're not the same line. They will intersect\\nat one place. Dependent-- they're\\nthe exact same line. Any point that satisfies one\\nline will satisfy the other. Any points that\\nsatisfies one equation will satisfy the other. So with that said, let's see if\\nthis system of linear equations right here is dependent\\nor independent. So they're kind of\\nhaving us assume that it's going\\nto be consistent, that we're going to\\nintersect in one place or going to intersect in an\\ninfinite number of places. And the easiest way to\\ndo this-- we already have this second equation here. It's already in\\nslope-intercept form. We know the slope is negative\\n2, the y-intercept is 8. Let's put this first equation\\nup here in slope-intercept form and see if it has a different\\nslope or a different intercept. Or maybe it's the same line. So we have 4x plus\\n2y is equal to 16. We can subtract 4x\\nfrom both sides. What we want to do is isolate\\nthe y on the left hand side. So let's subtract\\n4x from both sides. The left hand side-- we\\nare just left with a 2y. And then the right hand side,\\nwe have a negative 4x plus 16. I just wrote the negative\\n4 in front of the 16, just so that we have it in the\\ntraditional slope-intercept form. And now we can divide both\\nsides of this equation by 2, so that we can isolate\\nthe y on the left hand side. Divide both sides by 2. We are left with y is equal\\nto negative 4 divided by 2 is negative 2x plus\\n16 over 2 plus 8. So all I did is algebraically\\nmanipulate this top equation up here. And when I did that, when\\nI solved essentially for y, I got this right\\nover here, which is the exact same thing\\nas the second equation. We have the exact same slope,\\nnegative 2, negative 2, and we have the exact\\nsame y-intercept, 8 and 8. If I were to graph these\\nequations-- that's my x-axis, and that is my y-axis-- both\\nof them have a y-intercept at 8 and then have a\\nslope of negative 2. So they look\\nsomething-- I'm just drawing an approximation of it--\\nbut they would look something like that. So maybe this is the graph\\nof this equation right here, this first equation. And then the second equation\\nwill be the exact same graph. It has the exact\\nsame y-intercept and the exact same slope. So clearly these two\\nlines are dependent. They have an infinite\\nnumber of points that are common to both of them,\\nbecause they're the same line. \",\n",
       " '6.5.5': \"We're told to look at the\\ncoordinate grid above. I put it on the side here. Identify one system\\nof two lines that has a single solution. Then identify one system\\nof two lines that does not have a solution. So let's do the first part\\nfirst. So a single solution. And they say identify one\\nsystem, but we can see here there's actually going to\\nbe two systems that have a single solution. And when we talk about a single\\nsolution, we're talking about a single x and y value\\nthat will satisfy both equations in the system. So if we look right here at the\\npoints of intersection, this point right there, that\\nsatisfies this equation y is equal to 0.1x plus 1. And it also satisfies, well,\\nthis blue line, but the graph that that line represents,\\ny is equal to 4x plus 10. So this dot right here, that\\npoint represents a solution to both of these. Or I guess another way to think\\nabout it, it represents an x and y value that satisfy\\nboth of these constraints. So one system that has one\\nsolution is the system that has y is equal to 0.1x plus 1,\\nand then this blue line right here, which is y is equal\\nto 4x plus 10. Now, they only want us to\\nidentify one system of two lines that has a single\\nsolution. We've already done that. But just so you see it, there's\\nactually another system here. So this is one system right\\nhere, or another system would be the green line and\\nthis red line. This point of intersection right\\nhere, once again, that represents an x and y value\\nthat satisfies both the equation y is equal to 0.1x plus\\n1, and this point right here satisfies the equation\\ny is equal to 4x minus 6. So if you look at this system,\\nthere's one solution, because there's one point of\\nintersection of these two equations or these two lines,\\nand this system also has one solution because it has one\\npoint of intersection. Now, the second part of the\\nproblem, they say identify one system of two lines that does\\nnot have a single solution or does not have a solution,\\nso no solution. So in order for there to be no\\nsolution, that means that the two constraints don't overlap,\\nthat there's no point that is common to both equations or\\nthere's no pair of x, y values that's common to\\nboth equations. And that's the case of the two\\nparallel lines here, this blue line and this green line. Because they never intersect,\\nthere's no coordinate on the coordinate plane that satisfies\\nboth equations. So there's no x and y\\nthat satisfy both. So the second part of the\\nquestion, a system that has no solution is y is equal to 4x\\nplus 10, and then the other one is y is equal\\nto 4x minus 6. And notice, they have the exact\\nsame slope, and they're two different lines, they have\\ndifferent intercepts, so they never, ever intersect,\\nand that's why they have no solutions. \",\n",
       " '6.5.6': \"So that we don't get stumped\\nby the Arbeglas in our life and especially when we don't\\nhave talking birds to help us, we should be able to\\nidentify when things get a little bit weird with\\nour systems of equations. When we have scenarios that have\\nan infinite number of solutions or that have no\\nsolutions at all. And just as a little bit of a\\nreview of what could happen, these are the-- think\\nabout the three scenarios. You have the first\\nscenario which is kind of where we started off,\\nwhere you have two systems that just intersect in one place. And then you have\\nessentially one solution. So if you were to\\ngraphically represent it you have one solution right\\nover there, one solution. And this means that the two\\nconstraints are consistent and the two constraints are\\nindependent of each other. They're not the exact same line,\\nconsistent and independent. Then you have the other scenario\\nwhere they're consistent, they intersect,but they're\\nessentially the same line. They intersect everywhere. So this is one of the\\nconstraints for one of the equations,\\nand the other one if you look at it,\\nif you graph it, it is actually the\\nexact same one. So here you have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. It's consistent, you\\ndo have solutions here, but they're dependent equations. It's a dependent system. And then the last\\nscenario, and this is when you're dealing\\nin two dimensions, the last scenario is where\\nyour two constraints just don't intersect with each other. One might look like\\nthis, and then the other might look like this. They have the exact\\nsame slope but they have different intercepts. So this there is no solution,\\nthey never intersect. And we call this an\\ninconsistent system. And if you wanted to think\\nabout what would happen just think about what's\\ngoing on here. Here you have different slopes. And if you think about\\nit, two different lines with different\\nslopes are definitely going to intersect\\nin exactly one place. Here they have the same\\nslope and same y-intercept, so you have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. Here you have the same slope\\nbut different y-intercepts, and you get no solutions. So the times when\\nyou're solving systems where things are going\\nto get a little bit weird are when you have\\nthe same slope. And if you think about it,\\nwhat defines the slope, and I encourage you to test this\\nout with different equations, is when you have-- if you\\nhave your x's and y's, or you have your a's and b's or\\nyou have your variables on the same side of\\nan equation, where they have the same ratio\\nwith respect to each other. So with that, kind of\\nkeeping that in mind, let's see if we can think\\nabout what types of solutions we might find. So let's take this down. So they say determine\\nhow many solutions exist for the\\nsystem of equations. So you have 10x minus\\n2y is equal to 4, and 10x minus 2y is equal to 16. So just based on what we\\njust talked about the x's and the y's are on the\\nsame side of the equation and the ratio is\\n10 to negative 2. Same ratio. So something strange is\\ngoing to happen here. But when we have the\\nsame kind of combination of x's and y's in the first one\\nwe get 4, and on the second one we get 16. So that seems a\\nlittle bit bizarre. Another way to\\nthink about it, we have the same number of\\nx's, the same number of y's but we got a different number\\non the right hand side. So if you were to simplify\\nthis, and we could even look at the hints\\nto see what it says, you'll see that\\nyou're going to end up with the same slope but\\ndifferent y-intercepts. So we convert both the slope\\nintercept form right over here and you see one, the blue one\\nis y is equal to 5x minus 2, and the green one is y\\nis equal to 5x minus 8. Same slope, same ratio\\nbetween the x's and the Y's, but you have different\\nvalues right over here. You have different y-intercepts. So here you have no solutions. That is this scenario right over\\nhere if you were to graph it. So no solutions,\\ncheck our answer. Let's go to the next question. So let's look at this\\none right over here. So we have negative 5 times\\nx and negative 1 times y. We have 4 times x and 1 times y. So it looks like the\\nratio if then we're looking at the x's and y's\\nalways on the left hand side right over here, it looks like\\nthe ratios of x's and y's are different. You have essentially\\n5 x's for every one y, or you could say negative 5\\nx's for every negative 1 y, and here you have 4\\nx's for every 1 y. So this is fundamentally\\na different ratio. So right off the bat\\nyou could say well these are going to intersect\\nin exactly one place. If you were to put this\\ninto slope intercept form, you will see that they\\nhave different slopes. So you could say\\nthis has one solution and you can check your answer. And you could look at the\\nsolution just to verify. And I encourage you to do this. So you see the blue one if you\\nput in the slope intercept form negative 5x plus 10 and\\nyou take the green one into slope intercept\\nform negative 4x minus 8. So different slopes,\\nthey're definitely going to intersect\\nin exactly one place. You're going to\\nhave one solution. Let's try another one. So here we have 2x plus\\ny is equal to negative 3. And this is pretty\\nclear, you have 2x plus y is equal\\nto negative 3. These are the exact\\nsame equations. So it's consistent information,\\nthere's definitely solutions. But there's an infinite number\\nof solutions right over here. This is a dependent system. So there are infinite\\nnumber of solutions here and we can check our answer. Let's do one more because that\\nwas a little bit too easy. OK so this is interesting\\nright over here, we have it in different forms. 2x plus y is equal\\nto negative 4, y is equal to\\nnegative 2x minus 4. So let's take this\\nfirst blue equation and put it into\\nslope intercept form. If we did that you would\\nget, if you just subtract 2x from both sides you get y is\\nequal to negative 2x minus 4, which is the exact same thing as\\nthis equation right over here. So once again they're\\nthe exact same equation. You have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. Check our answer, and you can\\nlook at the solution right here. You convert the blue\\none into slope intercept and you get the exact\\nsame thing as what you saw in the green one. \",\n",

plus\\xa0\\n9 Y is equal to negative 36 negative 36\\xa0\\xa0 now what I'm going to do is I'm going\\xa0\\nto add the left side of the equations\\xa0\\xa0 and the right sides of the equations to\\xa0\\nget a new equation so 5x minus 5x well\\xa0\\xa0 that's going to be 0 negative 9y plus 9y\\xa0\\nwell that's going to be 0 again I don't\\xa0\\xa0 even have to write it it's just going\\xa0\\nto be 0 on the left-hand side and on\\xa0\\xa0 the right-hand side I'm going to have\\xa0\\n16 minus 36 so negative 20 so now I'm\\xa0\\xa0 left with the somewhat bizarre-looking\\xa0\\nequation that says that 0 is equal to\\xa0\\xa0 negative 20 now one way you might say\\xa0\\nwell how does this make any sense and\\xa0\\xa0 the way to think about it is well are\\xa0\\nthere any X Y values 4 which is 0 is\\xa0\\xa0 going to be equal to negative 20 well no\\xa0\\n0 is never going to be equal to negative\\xa0\\xa0 20 and so it doesn't matter what X Y\\xa0\\nvalues you can never find an X well X or\\xa0\\xa0 XY pair that's going to make 0 equal to\\xa0\\nnegative 20 in fact the X's and Y's have\\xa0\\xa0 disappeared from this equation there's\\xa0\\nno way that this is going to be true so\\xa0\\xa0 we have no we have no solutions now if\\xa0\\nyou were to plot these if you were to\\xa0\\xa0 plot each of these lines you would see\\xa0\\nthat they are parallel lines and that's\\xa0\\xa0 why they have the same slope different\\xa0\\ny-intercepts and that's why we have no\\xa0\\xa0 solutions they don't intersect let's do\\xa0\\nanother one of these this is this is fun\\xa0\\xa0 all right how many solutions does the\\xa0\\nfollowing system of linear equations\\xa0\\xa0 have so let's do the same thing I'm\\xa0\\ngoing to keep the first equation the\\xa0\\xa0 same negative 6x plus 4y is equal to 2\\xa0\\nand the second equation let me just see\\xa0\\xa0 if I can cancel out the X term so if I\\xa0\\nhave a negative 6x if I multiply this by\\xa0\\xa0 2 I'm going to have a positive 6x so I\\xa0\\ncan let's see I'm going to multiply this\\xa0\\xa0 whole equation both sides of it by 2 so\\xa0\\nI'm going to have 6x 3 x times 2 is 6x\\xa0\\xa0 negative 2y times 2 is negative 4y and\\xa0\\nthat is going to be equal to negative\\xa0\\xa0 2 now let's do the same thing let's\\xa0\\nadd the left sides and let's add the\\xa0\\xa0 right sides so negative 6x plus 6x well\\xa0\\nthat's going to be 0 4y minus 4y that's\\xa0\\xa0 0 we just have a 0 on the left-hand\\xa0\\nside now on the right-hand side we\\xa0\\xa0 have 2 plus negative 2 well that's 0 so\\xa0\\nthis is a little bit different it still\\xa0\\xa0 looks a little bit bizarre 0 equals\\xa0\\n0 last time we had 0 is equal to we\\xa0\\xa0 add what 0 is equal to negative 20 now\\xa0\\nwe have 0 equals 0 so one way to think\\xa0\\xa0 about it is even though the X's and\\xa0\\nY's are no longer in this equation\\xa0\\xa0 okay well what XY pairs is it going to\\xa0\\nbe true for is that it's going to make\\xa0\\xa0 it true that 0 is equal to 0 well this\\xa0\\nis going to be true no matter what x and\\xa0\\xa0 y are in

if you\\xa0\\njust multiply both sides of this one\\xa0\\xa0 the second one by negative 2 you're\\xa0\\ngoing to get the top one and so they\\xa0\\xa0 actually represent the exact same\\xa0\\nlines

it\\xa0\\nin this first equation if Y is equal\\xa0\\xa0 to negative 1 all of this becomes\\xa0\\npositive 2 you can subtract 2 from\\xa0\\xa0 both sides and you get 5x is equal to\\xa0\\n4 or you'd

       " '6.6.1': \"We're told that\\nin 40 years, Imran will be 11 times as\\nold as he is right now. And then we're asked,\\nhow old is he right now? And so I encourage you\\nto try this on your own. Well, let's see if we can\\nset this up as an equation. So let's figure out what\\nour unknown is first. Well, our unknown is\\nhow old he is right now. I'm just arbitrarily using x. We always like to use x. But I could've really\\nset it to be anything. But let's say x is equal\\nto how old he is right now. How old-- not how hold. How old he is now. Now, what do we know about how\\nold he will be in 40 years? Well, he's going to be\\nhow old he is now plus 40. So let me write that down. So in 40 years Imran is\\ngoing to be x plus 40, plus this 40 right over here. But they give us another\\npiece of information. This by itself isn't\\nenough to figure out how old he is right now. But they tell us\\nin 40 years, Imran will be 11 times as\\nold as he is right now. So that's saying that this\\nquantity right over here, x plus 40, is going\\nto be 11 times x. In 40 years, he's\\ngoing to be 11 times as old as he is right now. So this is going to be times 11. You take x, multiply\\nit times 11, you're going to get how old\\nhe's going to be in 40 years. So let's write that\\ndown as an equation. You take x, multiply\\nit by 11, so 11 times as old as he is\\nright now is how old he is going to be in 40 years. And we have set up a nice\\nlittle, tidy linear equation now. So we just have to solve for x. So let's get all the x's\\non the left-hand side. We have more x's here than\\non the right-hand side. So we avoid negative numbers,\\nlet's stick all the x's here. So if I want to get rid of\\nthis x on the right hand side, I'd want to subtract an x. But obviously, I can't\\njust do it to the right. Otherwise, the equality\\nwon't be true anymore. I need to do it on\\nthe left as well. And so I am left with--\\nif I have 11 of something and I take away 1 of them, I'm\\nleft with 10 of that something. So I'm left with 10 times x is\\nequal to-- well, these x's, x minus x is just 0. That was the whole point. It's going to be equal to 40. And you could do this in\\nyour head at this point, but let's just\\nsolve it formally. So if we want a 1\\ncoefficient here, we'd want to divide\\nby 10, but we've got to do that to both sides. And so we are left with-- and\\nwe could have our drum roll now. We are left with x is\\nequal to 4 years old. x is equal to 4. So our answer to the question,\\nhow old is Imran right now? He is 4 years old. And let's verify this. If he's 4 years old\\nright now, in 40 years he's going to be 44 years old. And 44 years old is indeed 11\\ntimes older than 4 years old. This is a factor of 11\\nyears, so it all worked out. \",\n",
       " '6.6.2': \"Let's do some more of these\\nclassic age word problems. So we're told that William\\nis 4 times as old as Ben. 12 years ago, William was\\n7 times as old as Ben. How old is Ben now? Once again, it's\\na good idea to try to do this on your own first,\\nand then I'll work through it. What's the unknown here? Well, the unknown here\\nis how old is Ben now. So let's set a variable equal\\nto that, and we do x or y. But since Ben starts with\\na b, let's use b for Ben. So let's let b equal Ben's\\ncurrent age, Ben's age now. Let's see how all of\\nthis other information relates to Ben's current\\nage, and then maybe we can set up some equation\\nand then solve for things. I'll do it a little bit\\nmore structured in this one. You could have done many\\nof the problems we've been working on in this way. Let's think about Ben, and\\nthen let's think about William. I'll do William in blue here. So let's think about William. And then there's two points\\nin time we're talking about. We're talking about\\nnow, today, and we're going to talk\\nabout 12 years ago. Over here, let's call that now. This will be our now\\ncolumn, and then this will be our 12 years ago. Let's see what we\\ncan fill in here. What is Ben's age now? Well, we just defined\\nthat as the variable b. That's the unknown. That's what we\\nhave to figure out. So let's just stick that there. That's just going to be b. Well, what's Ben's\\nage 12 years ago? So maybe we want to\\nexpress it in terms of b. If he's b now, 12 years\\nago, he was just b minus 12. Fair enough. Now what is William's age today? Well, this first sentence\\ngave us the information. William is 4 times\\nas old as Ben. And we can assume that\\nthey're talking about today, is 4 times as old as Ben. So if Ben is b, William\\nis going to be 4b. And so how old was\\nWilliam 12 years ago? Well, if he's 4b right\\nnow, 12 years ago, he'll just be 12 less than that. So he's 4b now. 12 years ago, he\\nwas 4b minus 12. So that's kind of interesting. But we haven't quite yet made\\nuse of the second statement. This is William 12 years ago. 12 years ago, William was\\n7 times as old as Ben. So 12 years ago, this number\\nis going to be 7 times this number. Or another way to think\\nabout, take this number and multiply it by 7, and\\nyou're going to get this number. 12 years ago, Ben's age\\nis 1/7 of William's age, or William's age is\\n7 times Ben's age. So let's see if we can set\\nthat up as an equation. We can have-- let me\\nwrite this down-- 7 times Ben's age 12 years\\nago, b minus 12, is going to be equal\\nto William's age. And it seems like we've\\ndone the hard part. We've set up the equation. Now we just use a little\\nbit of our algebraic tools to solve for b. So let's do that. The first thing we\\nmight want to do, we could distribute\\nthe 7, so 7 times b, 7 times, essentially,\\na negative 12. We have 7b minus 7\\ntimes 12-- let's see. That's 84-- is going to\\nbe equal to 4b minus 12. This whole expression\\nis literally 7 times Ben's age 12 years ago. Now what can we\\ndo to solve this? Well, we can subtract 4b from\\nboth sides, so let's do that. I could do two steps\\nat the same time. Well, actually, let's\\njust keep it simple. I'm going to subtract\\n4b from both sides. That goes away. On the right-hand side,\\nI have a negative 12. On the left-hand side, I am\\nleft with 7b minus 4b is 3b. And then I still\\nhave a minus 84. Well, I want to get rid of\\nthis negative 84, this minus 84 on the left-hand side. So let's add 84 to both sides. On the left-hand side,\\nI'm just left with 3b. And on the right-hand side,\\nI have negative 12 plus 84, or 84 minus 12, which is 72. Now if I want to\\nsolve for b, I just have to divide both sides\\nof that equation by 3. And so I am left\\nwith b is equal to-- and now we have our\\ndrum roll-- 72/3. And you might be able\\nto do that in your head. It would be 24, I believe. You could work it out on\\npaper if you have trouble. Let's just do it real quick. 72, 3 goes into 7 two times. You get a 2 times 3 is 6,\\nsubtract, you bring down the 2, 3 goes into 12 four times. So b is equal to 24. Going back to our question,\\nwhat is Ben's age now? It is 24. And let's verify that\\nthis is actually the case. They're telling us that William\\nis 4 times as old as Ben. So what is William's\\ncurrent age? Well, 4 times 24 is 96,\\nso William is a senior. We should call him Mr. William. He is 96 years old. Maybe he's Ben's grandfather\\nor great-grandfather. Then they say 12 years ago,\\nWilliam-- well, 12 years ago, William was 84 years old. So he was 84 years old. They say that's 7\\ntimes as old as Ben.

And what I am curious\\nabout in this video is how many years will it\\ntake-- and let me write this down-- how many\\nyears will it take for Arman to be three\\ntimes as old as Diya? So that's the\\nquestion right there, and I encourage you to try to\\ntake a shot at this yourself. So let's think about\\nthis a little bit. We're asking how many\\nyears will it take. That's what we don't know. That's what we're curious about. How many years will\\nit take for Arman to be three times\\nas old as Diya? So let's set some variable--\\nlet's say, y for years. Let's say y is equal\\nto years it will take. So given that, can we\\nnow set up an equation, given this information,\\nto figure out how many years it will take\\nfor Arman to be three times as old as Diya? Well, let's think about how\\nold Arman will be in y years. How old will he be? Let me write here. In y years, Arman is\\ngoing to be how old? Arman is going to be--\\nwell, he's 18 right now-- and in y years, he's\\ngoing to be y years older. So in y years, Arman is\\ngoing to be 18 plus y. And what about Diya? How old will she be in y years? Well, she's 2 now,\\nand in y years, she will just be 2 plus y. So what we're curious about,\\nnow that we know this, is how many years will it\\ntake for this quantity, for this expression, to be\\nthree times this quantity? So we're really curious. We want to solve for\\ny such that 18 plus y is going to be equal\\nto 3 times 2 plus y. Notice, this is\\nArman in y years. This is Diya in y years. And we're saying that what\\nArman's going to be in y years is three times what Diya\\nis going to be in y years. So we've set up our equation. Now we can just solve it. So let's take this step by step. So the left hand\\nside-- and maybe I'll do this in a new\\ncolor, just so I don't have to keep switching--\\nso on the left hand side, I still have 18 plus y. And on the right hand side,\\nI can distribute this 3. So 3 times 2 is 6. 3 times y is 3y. 6 plus 3y. And then it's always nice\\nto get all of our constants on one side of the equation,\\nall of our variables on the other side\\nof the equation. So we have a 3y over here. We have more y's on the right\\nhand side than the left hand side. So let's get rid of the\\ny's on the left hand side. You could do it\\neither way, but you'd end up with negative numbers. So let's subtract\\na y from each side. And we are left with, on\\nthe left hand side, 18. And on the right hand side\\nyou have 6 plus 3 y's. Take away one of those y's. You're going to be\\nleft with 2 y's. Now we can get rid of\\nthe constant term here. So we will subtract\\n6 from both sides. 18 minus 6 is 12. The whole reason why we\\nsubtracted 6 from the right was to get rid of this, 6\\nminus 6 is 0, so you have 12 is equal to 2y. Two times the number of\\nyears it will take is 12, and you could probably\\nsolve this in your head. But if we just want a\\none-coefficient year, we would divide\\nby 2 on the right. Whatever we do to one\\nside of an equation, we have to do it\\non the other side. Otherwise, the equation will\\nnot still be an equation. So we're left with y is equal\\nto 6, or y is equal to 6. So going back to the\\nquestion, how many years will it take for Arman to be\\nthree times as old as Diya? Well, it's going\\nto take six years. Now, I want you to verify this. Think about it. Is this actually true? Well, in six years, how\\nold is Arman going to be? He's going to be 18 plus 6. We now know that\\nthis thing is 6. So in six years,\\nArman is going to be 18 plus 6, which\\nis 24 years old. How old is Diya going to be? Well, she's going to be 2\\nplus 6, which is 8 years old. And lo and behold, 24 is,\\nindeed, three times as old as 8. In 6 years-- Arman\\nis 24, Diya is 8-- Arman is three times as\\nold as Diya, and we are done. \",\n",
       " '6.6.4': \"- [Voiceover] Yochanan walked\\nfrom home to the bus stop at an average speed of\\nfive kilometers per hour. He immediately got on his school bus and traveled at an average speed of 60 kilometers per hour\\nuntil he got to school. The total distance from his home to school is 35 kilometers, and the entire trip took one and a half hours. How many kilometers did Yochanan cover by walking, and how many kilometers did he cover by travelling\\non the bus? It's fascinating. So I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about on your own. Alright, so let's just\\ndefine some variables here. How many kilometers did\\nhe cover by walking? Let's call this W and how many kilometers did he cover by travelling on the bus? Let's call that, Let's call that B and so what do we know? We know that the kilometers and I can actually even\\ndraw it just to make sure that we're visualizing this thing, right? So this right over here is\\nhis home, that's his home and then he is going to\\ntravel and see they tell us, they tell us that it is\\n35 kilometers to school so this is his school right over here. I'll draw a bigger\\nbuilding, that's his school, and we know that this\\ndistance is 35, 35 kilometers and we also know that it\\ntook one and a half hours. One and a half hours, now he traveled at different rates for\\ndifferent distances. So he traveled some\\ndistance to the school bus so this is, or to the bus stop, so that's the bus stop, right over there, and we're seeing this\\ndistance to the bus stop, that's how much he covered by walking. So this right over here, this\\ndistance, right over here, that is W and the rest of the distance, he covered by the bus, so\\nthe rest of this distance, all of this distance right over there, that is going to be B. So what do we know? We know the distance covered by walking plus the distance covered by bus is going to be 35 kilometers,\\n35 kilometers here, this is the entire, that\\nis the entire distance from home to school, so\\nwe know that W plus B, W plus B, plus B is\\nequal to 35 kilometers, is equal to 35 kilometers\\nand just with one equation, we're not going to be able to\\nfigure out what W and B are but we have another constraint. We know the total amount of time. So the total amount of time is going to be one and half hours, so we'll\\njust write that over here. This is going to be 1.5, so\\nwhat's the time traveled by, what's the time he walks? Let me write this over here, time time walking, we'll that's going to be the distance walking\\ndivided by the rate walking. So the distance walking is W kilometers W kilometers divided by his rate, the distance divided by your rate is gonna give you your time, so let's see, his rate is five kilometers per hour, five kilometers per\\nhour and so you're gonna have kilometers cancel kilometers and if you divide by or\\nif you have one over hours in the denominator, that's\\ngoing to be the same thing, this is gonna be W over five\\nhours, so the units work out. So his time walking is W over five, W over five and by that same logic, his time on the bus is\\ngoing to be the distance on the bus divided by,\\ndivided by the average speed of the school bus, so\\nthis is going to be 60. This is all going to be in hours and now we can solve\\nthis system of equations. We have two linear\\nequations with two unknowns. We should be able to find W and B that satisfy both of these. Now what's an easy thing to do? Let's see, if I can multiply\\nthis second equation by negative five, and I'm gonna, this is going to be a negative W here so it'll cancel out with this W up there. So let's do that, let's\\nmultiply the second equation by, I'm just gonna\\nswitch to one color here, so this top equation is going\\nto be W plus B is equal to 35. This bottom equation,\\nif I multiply both sides by negative five, so both\\nsides by negative five, I'm going to multiply both\\nsides by negative five I'm going to get negative\\nfive times W over five is negative W, negative\\nfive times B over 60. Let's see, it's gonna be,\\nit's going to be negative five over 60, that's negative\\n1/12, so this is negative B over 12 and then it is\\ngoing to be equal to 1.5 times negative five is\\nnegative 7.5, negative 7.5. Now we can just add the left and right hand sides of these two equations. Now let me, I can do\\nthis a little bit neater, let me actually delete, let me make these line up a little bit better\\nso that we, delete that, make this, so this first\\nequation was, whoops, this first equation was\\nW plus B is equal to 35 now they line up better and now we can add the left hand sides of these equations and the right hand sides,\\nso the left hand sides, the W's cancel out. That's what we wanted. Now B minus B over 12 or\\nB minus the twelfth of B, well that's going to be 11/12B, 11/12B is equal to, let's see, 35 minus 7.5, see 35 minus seven would be 28 and then another\\nhalf this would be 27.5. 27.5 and since I'm dealing\\nwith a fraction here, let me write this as a fraction so this is the same thing as 55 over two. Let's me just write it this way. This is the same thing as 55 over two. Now to solve for B, I\\njust have to multiply both sides times this reciprocal. I'll switch colors just\\nto ease the monotony. So multiply both sides by\\n12 over 11, 12 over 11, what we get, these cancel out, what we get is that B, so I'll do this in this color, B is equal to, let's see, I\\nhave a 12 in the numerator two in the denominator so I can make that a six and a one,\\nthen I have a 55 and 11, I can divide both by 11, so\\nit's gonna be five and a one. So it's five times six, B is equal to 30 and B was in kilometers so\\nif he travels 30 kilometers, 30 kilometers by bus, B\\nis equal to 30 kilometers, and the amount that he walks,\\nwell, we can figure that out. If this is 30, well the amount that he walks is going to be five. This is going to be five kilometers, W, let me write this, W is\\nequal to five kilometers. He walks five kilometers and then he goes by the bus 30 kilometers. \",\n",
       " '6.6.5': \"- [Voiceover] A factory has\\nmachines that produce toys, which are then packed by\\nthe factory's workers. One day, each machine produced 14 toys and each worker packed two toys, so that a total of 40\\ntoys remained unpacked. Additionally, the number of\\nworkers that day was eight less than seven times the number of machines. How many machines and workers were there? I encourage you to pause the video. This is a good little problem over here. All right, so let's define some variables. So let's say M is equal to the number of machines, and let's say that W is equal to the number of workers. Those seem like reasonable variables. So what does the first sentence tell us? It tells us one day each\\nmachine produced 14 toys. So if each machine produced 14 toys, what is the total number of toys that are going to be produced? Well, the total number\\nof toys that are going to be produced is going to\\nbe the number per machine times the number of machines. So this is 14M toys produced. So this is what is produced.\\nProduced, right over there. And then how many toys\\nare going to be packed? Well, if each worker packed two toys, they tell us there, each\\nworker packed two toys, so the total number that's\\ngoing to be packed is going to be two toys per worker\\ntimes the number of workers. So that right over there, that's\\nthe number of toys packed. And then they tell us the\\nnumber of toys that remain, the total that remains unpacked. So the total that remains\\nunpacked, we know that that is 40. Let me do that in a neutral color. So 40, for 40, so that we could view the 40\\nas produced, but not packed. Produced, not packed. That's the number, the\\ntotal the remain unpacked. Well, how do we relate produced and packed to the produced that are not packed? Well, if we take the\\ntotal that were produced, we subtract out the\\nnumber that were packed, we're gonna be left with\\nthe total that are unpacked. So just like that, we're able to set up a linear\\nrelationship between M and W. Well, just one isn't enough\\nto solve for M and W, but we have another relationship. They say, additionally, the\\nnumber of workers that day, so the number of workers that day. I could say W. I'll write it over here. W, the number of workers that day, was eight less than seven\\ntimes the number of machines. Or you could say it was equal\\nto seven times the number of machines minus eight. That would be eight less\\nthan seven times the number of machines. 7M minus eight. And now we have two\\nequations with two unknowns. If things work out well, we might be able to actually solve for W and M. So there is a bunch of ways to do it. Since this equation already\\nhas W explicitly solved for, we can do some substitution here. We can take this W and\\nsubstitute it in for this W. Or, actually I should say,\\nwe could take 7M minus eight and substitute it in for this W, since the M and W, the\\npair that we wanna find, need to satisfy both equations. And so we are going to get, we're going to get 14M minus, minus two, minus two times, let me do that in a, so minus two times, and instead of a W, I can write the 7M minus eight. So 7M minus eight, and we get that equals 40, is equal to 40, so we get, now it's just a little bit of algebra. 14M and then, let's see, I'll do everything in a neutral color now. So negative two times 7M is negative 14M, and then negative two times negative eight is plus 16, and then that's going to be equal to 40. Now, 14M minus 14M, that's\\njust going to be zero, and we're left that 16 is equal to 40. Well, that's never going to be true. 16 is never going to be equal to 40. Doesn't matter what M and W are. In fact, M and W have been\\neliminated from this equation. This is impossible. This right over here is impossible, for 16 to be equal to 40, and because of that, there\\nare no solutions to this. There's no M and W pair that matches the constraints they gave us, so there is no solution. No solution. I'll put that in a little square there. \",\n",
       " '6.6.6': \"- [Voiceover] Farmer Jan\\nis a vegetable farmer who divides his field\\nbetween broccoli crops and spinach crops. Last year, he grew six\\ntons of broccoli per acre, so six tons of broccoli per acre, and nine tons of spinach, nine tons of spinach per acre, for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. This year, he grew two\\ntons of broccoli per acre, so this year, he grew two\\ntons of broccoli per acre, and three tons of spinach per acre, and three tons of spinach per acre, for a total of 31 tons of vegetables. How many acres of broccoli\\ncrops and how many acres of spinach crops does Farmer Jan have? So let's think about this. So let's say that the number\\nof acres of broccoli crops, let's call that B, and let's say the acres of spinach crops, acres of spinach crops, let's call that S. So how much broccoli is he going to grow in, I guess you could say, last year? Last year, how much broccoli did he grow? And let me just write this\\ndown. This is last year. Last year. And they tell us, last\\nyear he grew six tons of broccoli per acre. So if he grew six tons\\nof broccoli per acre, and he has B acres, well, that means he grew six tons per acre times B acres. So he grew 6B tons of broccoli last year. And by the same logic,\\nhe grew how much spinach? Well, nine tons of spinach\\nper acre times S acres. So 9S tons of spinach, and then the total is 93 tons, so for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 93. So now let's think about this year. And in general, when you\\ntackle these, just think about, well, set the variables in general to what they're asking for, and then, how can you use the information\\nthat they're giving us? So this year, how much\\nbroccoli would he have grown? Well, he grew two tons\\nof broccoli per acre, so he grew two tons per acre. He has the same number of\\nacres. We can assume that. So two tons per acre times B acres is gonna be 2B tons of broccoli. And by that same logic, it's going to be, he grew three tons of spinach per acre. Well, he has S acres. Each of those acres,\\nhe's growing three tons of spinach per acre, so it's\\ngoing to be 3S tons of spinach. And they tell us what that total is. That total is, for a total\\nof 31 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 31. And so now we have a\\nsystem of two equations with two unknowns, that we\\ncan use to solve for B and S. So let's see. What do we\\nwanna solve for first? Well, what we could do, let\\nme rewrite the top equation. So we have 6B plus, plus 9S is equal to 93, is equal to 93. And the second equation, we'll let's try to eliminate the Bs. So let's multiply the second\\nequation by negative three. I'm gonna multiply the left\\nhand side by negative three, and I'm gonna multiply the right hand side by negative three. What am I going to get? Negative three times 2B is negative 6B. That was the whole point by multiplying it by negative three. Negative three times 3S is negative 9S, negative 9S. And then, negative three times 31 is going to be negative 93. So what do we get if we\\nnow add the two sides of these equations? So on the left hand side,\\n6B minus 6B, that's zero. 9S minus 9S, that's zero.\\nWe're gonna get just zero. On the right hand side we get 93 minus 93. Well, that's still just going to be zero. So we have this situation\\nwhere we get zero equals zero, which is going to be true\\nno matter what X and Y are, and so this is a system\\nwith an infinite number of solutions. So this has infinite, infinite number of solutions. So one way we could think about it is, these two constraints, they're not giving us enough information. There's an infinite number\\nof B and S combinations that would satisfy these equations, so they're not giving\\nus enough information to say exactly what B and S are. So there is not enough, not enough info! Put an exclamation mark there. \",\n",
       " '6.6.7': \"An electronics warehouse ships\\ntelevisions and DVD players in certain combinations\\nto retailers throughout the country. They tell us that the weight\\nof 3 televisions and 5 DVD players is 62.5 pounds, and the\\nweight of 3 televisions and 2 DVD players-- so they're\\ngiving us different combinations-- is 52 pounds. Create a system of\\nequations that represents this situation. Then solve it to find out how\\nmuch each television and DVD player weighs. Well, the two pieces of\\ninformation they gave us in each of these statements can be\\nconverted into an equation. The first one is is that the\\nweight of 3 televisions and 5 DVD players is 62.5 pounds. Then they told us that the\\nweight of 3 televisions and 2 DVD players is 52 pounds. So we can translate these\\ndirectly into equations. If we let t to be the weight of\\na television, and d to be the weight of a DVD player, this\\nfirst statement up here says that 3 times the weight\\nof a television, or 3 televisions, plus 5 times the\\nweight of a DVD player, is going to be equal\\nto 62.5 pounds. That's exactly what this first\\nstatement is telling us. The second statement, the weight\\nof 3 televisions and 2 DVD players, so if I have 3\\ntelevisions and 2 DVD players, so the weight of 3 televisions\\nplus the weight of 2 DVD players, they're telling us\\nthat that is 52 pounds. And so now we've set up the\\nsystem of equations. We've done the first part,\\nto create a system that represents the situation. Now we need to solve it. Now, one thing that's especially\\ntempting when you have two systems, and both of\\nthem have something where, you know, you have a 3t here and\\nyou have a 3t here, what we can do is we can multiply one of\\nthe systems by some factor, so that if we were to add this\\nequation to that equation, we would get one of the terms\\nto cancel out. And that's what we're going\\nto do right here. And you can do this, you can\\ndo this business of adding equations to each other, because\\nremember, when we learned this at the beginning of\\nalgebra, anything you do to one side of an equation, if\\nI add 5 to one side of an equation, I have to add 5 to\\nanother side of the equation. So if I add this business to\\nthis side of the equation, if I add this blue stuff to the\\nleft side of the equation, I can add this 52 to the\\nright-hand side, because this is saying that 52 is the same\\nthing as this thing over here. This thing is also 52. So if we're adding this to the\\nleft-hand side, we're actually adding 52 to it. We're just writing it\\na different way. Now, before we do that, what I\\nwant to do is multiply the second, blue equation\\nby negative 1. And I want to multiply\\nit by negative 1. So negative 3t plus-- I could\\nwrite negative 2d is equal to negative 52. So I haven't changed the\\ninformation in this equation. I just multiplied everything\\nby negative 1. The reason why I did that is\\nbecause now if I add these two equations, these 3t terms\\nare going to cancel out. So let's do that. Let's add these two equations. And remember, all we're doing is\\nwe're adding the same thing to both sides of this\\ntop equation. We're adding essentially\\nnegative 52 now, now that we've multiplied everything\\nby a negative 1. This negative 3t plus negative\\n2d is the same thing as negative 52. So let's add this left-hand\\nside over here. The 3t and the negative\\n3t will cancel out. That was the whole point. 5d plus negative 2d is 3d. So you have a 3d is equal to\\n62.5 plus negative 52, or 62.5 minus 52 is 10.5. And now we can divide both sides\\nof this equation by 3. And you get d is equal\\nto 10.5 divided by 3. So let's figure out\\nwhat that is. 3 goes into 10.5-- it goes\\ninto 10 three times. 3 times 3 is 9. Subtract. Get 1. Bring down the 5. Of course, you have your decimal\\npoint right here. 3 goes into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15. You've got to subtract,\\nand you get a 0. So it goes exactly 3.5 times. So the weight of a DVD player--\\nthat's what d represents-- is 3.5 pounds. Now we can substitute back into\\none of these equations up here to figure out the weight\\nof a television. We can just use that\\ntop equation. So you get 3t plus 5 times the\\nweight of a DVD player, which we just figured out is 3.5. Remember, we're just looking for\\nvalues that satisfy both of these equations. So 5 times 3.5-- needs\\nto be equal to 62.5. So you get 3t plus-- what\\nis this going to be? This is going to be 15\\nplus 2.5, right? 5 times 0.5 is 2.5,\\n5 times 3 is 15. So it's 17.5, is\\nequal to 62.5. Now we can subtract 17.5 from\\nboth sides of this equation. And what do we get? The left-hand side is\\njust going to be 3t. This cancels out, that was\\nthe whole point of it. 3t is going to be equal\\nto-- let's see. The 0.5 minus 0.5,\\nthat cancels out. So this is the same thing\\nas 62 minus 17. 62 minus 7 would be 55. And so we're going to\\nsubtract another 10. So it's going to be 45. So this is going to\\nbe equal to 45. Now you can divide both sides\\nof this equation by 3. And we get t is equal to 15. So we've solved our system. The weight of a DVD player is\\n3.5 pounds, and the weight of a television is 15 pounds. And we're done. \",\n",
       " '6.6.8': \"You've gone to a fruit stand\\nto get some fresh produce. You notice that the\\nperson in front of you gets 5 apples and\\n4 oranges for $10. You get 5 apples and\\n5 oranges for $11. Can we solve for the price\\nof an apple and an orange using this information\\nin a system of linear equations\\nin two variables? If yes, what is the solution? If no, what is the\\nreason we cannot? So we're trying to figure\\nout the price of an apple and the price of an orange. So I would use a for apple, but\\nI don't like using o for orange because o looks too\\nmuch like a zero. So I'll just say x for apples. Let's let x equal\\nthe price of apples. And let's let y equal\\nthe price of oranges. So let's describe what\\nhappened to the person in line in front of us. They bought 5 apples. So how much did they\\nspend on apples? Well, they bought 5 apples\\ntimes x dollars per apple, so they spent 5x dollars\\non their 5 apples. And they bought 4 oranges. They bought 4 oranges\\ntimes y dollars per orange. So they spent 4y on oranges. So the total amount that\\nthey spent is 5x plus 4y. And they tell us\\nthat this is $10. This is equal to $10. Now, you get in line,\\nand you buy 5 apples. So you buy 5 apples, just\\nlike the guy in front of you. And you paid x\\ndollars per apple. So you're going to pay 5 apples\\ntimes the price per apple. This is the amount that\\nyou spend on apples. And then you buy 5 oranges. So you're going to pay 5 oranges\\ntimes the price per orange, which is y. So this is how much\\nyou spend on oranges. This is how much you spend on\\napples and oranges, the sum. And they tell us\\nthat this is $11. So can we solve\\nfor an x and a y? And it looks like we can. And a big giveaway\\nright over here is the ratio between the x's and\\nthe y's in these two equations are different. So we're getting some\\ninformation here. If the ratios were\\nexactly the same, if this was 5x plus\\n4y right over here, and we got a different number,\\nthen we would be in trouble. Because we bought\\nthe same combination, but we got a different price. But the good thing is is that\\nwe have a different combination here. So let's see if we\\ncan work it out. Now, the most obvious\\nthing that jumps out at me is that I have a 5x here, and\\nI have a 5x right over here. So if I could subtract\\nthis 5x from that 5x, then I would cancel\\nout all of the x terms. So what I'm going\\nto do is I'm going to multiply this bottom\\nequation by negative 1. So it becomes negative\\n5x plus negative 5y is equal to negative 11. And then I'm going\\nto essentially add both of these equations. And I could do that\\nbecause I'm doing the same thing to both sides. I already know that this\\nthing is equal to this thing. So I'm just adding those\\nthings to either side. So on the left hand\\nside, I have 5x minus 5x. Well, those cancel out. And then I have 4y minus 5y. Well, that's negative y. And that's going to be\\nequal to 10 minus 11, which is negative 1. And then if we multiply\\nboth sides of this times negative 1, or divide\\nboth sides by negative 1, we're going to get\\ny is equal to 1. So just like that, we\\nwere able to figure out the price of oranges. It's $1 per orange. So this is equal to 1. Now let's figure out\\nthe price of apples. So we can go back into\\neither 1 of these equations. I'll go back into this first 1. So 5 times-- so let's go to the\\nperson in line in front of us. They bought 5 apples\\nat x dollars per apple, plus 4 oranges at $1 per orange,\\nand they spent a total of $10. So this of course is just 4. Let's subtract 4\\nfrom both sides, and we get-- well, 4 times 1\\nminus 4, that just cancels out. We're just going to be left\\nwith 5x on the left hand side. And on the right hand\\nside, we have 10 minus 4, which is equal to 6. And we can just divide both\\nsides by 6 now in order to solve for x. Oh, sorry. We can divide both sides by\\n5 in order to solve for x. It's late in the day. Brain isn't working. Dividing by 6 wouldn't\\nhave done anything. We would have gotten 5/6x. We just want to get an x here. So dividing both sides by 5, we\\nget x is equal to 6/5 dollars. Or you could say that\\nx is equal to 6/5, which is the same\\nthing as 1 and 1/5, which is the same\\nthing as $1.20. So it's $1 per orange,\\nand $1.20 per apple. So we absolutely\\ncould figure out the prices of apples and oranges\\nusing the information given. \",\n",
       " '6.6.9': 'As a birthday gift,\\nZoey gave her niece an electronic piggy\\nbank that displays the total amount of\\nmoney in the bank as well as the total\\nnumber of coins. After depositing some number\\nof nickels and quarters only-- so we only have\\nnickels and quarters-- the display read money $2.00,\\nnumber of coins 16 How many nickels and quarters did\\nZoey put in the bank? So let\\'s define\\nsome variables here. Let\\'s let n equal the\\nnumber of nickels. Maybe I\\'ll write \"let\" here. Let\\'s let q be equal to\\nthe number of quarters. So how many total\\ncoins do we have? We\\'\\', it\\'s going to be\\nthe number of nickels plus the number of quarters. So we have the nickels\\nplus the quarters need to be equal to--\\nwell, it tells us we have 16 total coins. So if we add up the\\ntotal number of nickels plus the number of\\nquarters, we have 16 coins. So that\\'s one\\nequation right there. And then how much\\ntotal money do we have? Well, however many\\nnickels we have, we can multiply that\\ntimes 0.05, and that\\'ll tell us how much money\\nwe have in nickels. So 0.05 times the nickels\\nplus the amount of money we have in quarters. Well, that\\'ll just be $0.25\\nper quarter, or 0.25 of $1. So let me write 0.25 times\\nthe number of quarters. For example, if I had 4\\nquarters and no nickels, I\\'d have 4 times\\n$0.25 which is $1. And no money due to nickels. So it\\'s however may\\nnickels times $0.05 plus however many\\nquarters times $0.25. That\\'s the total\\namount of money I have. And her piggy bank\\ntells me that is $2.00. That is equal to $2.00. So we have two equations\\nwith two unknowns. We can solve for n and q. And let\\'s do it by substitution. So the easiest thing that\\nwe could do here, let\\'s solve for q over here. So if n plus q is\\nequal to 16, we could subtract n from both\\nsides of this equation. So if n plus q is equal\\nto 16, if we subtract n from both sides, we get\\nq is equal to 16 minus n. So all I did is I rewrote\\nthis first constraint right over there. So since this first\\nconstraint is telling us that q, the number\\nof quarters, must be 16 minus the\\nnumber of nickels, in the second constraint,\\nevery place that we see a q, every place\\nwe see quarters, we can replace it\\nwith 16 minus n. So let\\'s do that. So the second constraint when\\nwe make the substitution becomes 0.05n plus 0.25. Instead of q, I\\'m going\\nto write 16 minus n. That\\'s what the first constraint\\ntells us. q must be 16 minus n. That is going to\\nbe equal to $2.00. We\\'re solving this\\nsystem by substitution. Now let\\'s see if I\\ncan simplify this. So we have 0.05n plus-- let\\'s\\ndistribute the 0.25 times the 16 and the 0.25\\ntimes the negative n. 0.25 times 16, that\\'s the\\nsame thing as 1/4 times 16. That\\'s just going to be 4. And then 0.25 times\\nnegative n is minus 0.25n. And that is going to\\nbe equal to $2.00. Let me scroll down a little bit. I\\'ll scroll down a little bit. See we have 0.05n minus 0.25n. So if I have 0.05 minus 0.25,\\nlet me combine these terms. So if I have 0.05 of something,\\nand I\\'m going to subtract from that 0.25 of that something,\\nthat\\'ll give me negative 0.20 of that something. If I combine these two terms,\\nI get negative 0.20 or negative 0.2n. And then of course,\\nI have the plus 4. Plus 4 is equal to $2.00, or we\\ncould even just write 2 there. Now, we can isolate the\\nn on the left-hand side by subtracting 4\\nfrom both sides. So let\\'s subtract\\n4 from both sides. And we are left with, on the\\nleft-hand side, negative-- I could just write that is\\nnegative 0.20n is equal to 2 minus 4 is negative 2. And then we could divide\\nboth sides by negative 0.2. Or I could write negative\\n0.20, the same thing. We\\'re not going to go too deep\\ninto the significance in all that. We\\'re assuming that we\\nhave infinite precision on everything. So negative 2 divided\\nby negative 0.2, these guys cancel out,\\nand we are left with n is equal to-- the\\nnegatives cancel out. 2 divided by 0.2 is\\njust going to be 10. n is equal to 10. And then we know that q\\nis equal to 16 minus n from the first constraint. q is equal to 16 minus n, which\\nis 10, which is going to be 6. So Zoey put in 10 nickels. I want to do that in\\na different color. She put in 10 nickels and\\n6 quarters in the bank. And we can verify it. So clearly she has 16 coins. So that part makes sense. 10 nickels, 6 quarters,\\nthat\\'s 16 coins. That makes sense. And we could also verify that\\nit\\'s the right amount of money. 10 nickels are going to be\\n$0.50, 10 times $0.05 each. So it\\'s going to be $0.50. And then 6 quarters\\nis going to be $1.50. So it\\'s going to be $1.50. So the total amount of money she\\nhas is $0.50 plus $1.50 which is $2.00. So it all works out. ',\n",
       " '6.6.10': \"You are at a Parisian\\ncafe with a friend. A local in front of you buys a\\ncup of coffee and a croissant for $5 or 5.30 Euro. When you and your friend get\\ntwo cups of coffee and two croissants, you are\\ncharged 14 Euro. Can we solve for the price of\\na cup of coffee and croissant using the information\\ninto a system of linear equations\\nin two variables? If yes, what is the solution? If no, what is the\\nreason we cannot? So we're looking\\nfor two things-- the price of a cup of coffee\\nand the price of a croissant. So let's define\\ntwo variables here. Since we have all\\nthese C's here, I'm just going to\\nuse x's and y's. So let's let x be equal to the\\nprice of the cup of coffee. And let's let y be equal to\\nthe price of a croissant. So we first have\\nthis information of what the local\\nin front of us did. The local in front of us buys\\none cup of coffee and one croissant for 5.30 Euro. So how would we set\\nthat up as an equation? Well, we got one cup of coffee. So that's going to be one\\nx, or we could just write x, plus one y because\\nhe got one croissant, and it cost 5.30 Euro. So this equation describes\\nwhat happened to the local-- bought one cup of coffee, one\\ncroissant, paid 5.30 Euro. Now, when you and\\nyour friend get two cups of coffee\\nand two croissants, you are charged 14 Euro. So what's an equation\\nto describe this? So we should be charged\\ntwo times the price of a cup of coffee. So it should be 2x. And then we should be\\ncharged two times the price of a croissant, so plus 2y. And the sum of these\\nshould be the total amount that we're charged. So we've been charged 14 Euro. So let's see if we can solve\\nthis system of equations. And there's many, many,\\nmany ways to solve this. But the most\\nobvious way at least looking at this right over\\nhere is you have x, we have 2x, we have y, we have 2y. Let's take this first\\nequation that described local and multiply it by two. So let's just\\nmultiply it by two. So we're going to\\nmultiply both sides, otherwise equality\\nwon't hold anymore. So we would get 2x plus 2y is\\nequal to 2 times 5.30 is 10 euro 60. Now, something very\\ninteresting is going on here. If the local had bought twice\\nas many cups of coffee and twice as many croissants, he\\nwould have paid 10.60. And that would have been\\nthe exact amount of coffee and croissants you\\ngot and you paid 14. So it looks pretty\\nclear that you got charged a different amount. You got the tourist rate for\\nthe cup of coffee and croissant, while he got the local rate. And we can verify that\\nthere's no x and y that's going to satisfy this. And even logically\\nit makes sense here. 2x plus 2y is 14. Here, 2x plus 2y is 10 euro 60. And we could even show\\nthat mathematically this doesn't make sense. So if we were to subtract this\\nbottom equation from this top, so essentially you could\\nimagine multiplying the entire bottom\\nequation times negative 1. So let's multiply the entire\\nbottom equation by negative 1 and then we add\\nthese two equations. Remember all we're\\ndoing is we're starting with say this\\nequation, and we're adding the same\\nthing to both sides. We're going to add\\nthis to this side. And we already know that\\nnegative 10.60 is the same thing as this, we're\\ngoing to add to that side. So on the left hand side,\\nthis cancels with this, this cancels with this,\\nwe're left with 0. And on the right hand side,\\n14 minus 10.60 will get you to 3.40. And there's no x and y that\\nyou can think of that can all of a sudden make 0 equal 3.40. So there is no solution. And the only\\nexplanation over here is that the local was\\ncharged a cheaper rate. \",\n",
       " '7.1.1': \"Determine whether the\\nordered pairs 3 comma 5 and 1 comma negative 7 are solutions\\nto the inequality 5x minus 3y is greater than or equal to 25. So again, let me just try\\neach of these ordered pairs. We could try what happens\\nwhen x is equal to 3 and y is equal to 5\\nin this inequality and see if it satisfies it. And then we could try\\nit for 1 and negative 7. So let's do that first. Let's do it first for 3 and 5. So when x is 3, y is 5. Let's see if this\\nactually gets satisfied. So we get 5 times 3. Let me color code it. So this is 5-- I didn't want to\\ndo it in that color-- 5 times 3 minus 3 times 5. Let's see if this is\\ngreater than or equal to 25. So 5 times 3 is 15. And then from that, we're\\ngoing to subtract 15, and let's see if that is\\ngreater than or equal to 25. Put that question mark\\nthere because we don't know. And 15 minus 15, that is 0. So we get the expression 0 is\\ngreater than or equal to 25. This is not true. 0 is less than 25. So this is not true. This is not true. So this ordered pair is not\\na solution to the inequality. So this is not a solution. You put in x is\\n3, y is 5, you get 0 is greater than\\nor equal to 25, which is absolutely not true. Now let's try it with\\n1 and negative 7. So we have 5 times 1\\nminus 3 times negative 7 needs to be greater\\nthan or equal to 25. 5 times 1 is 5, and then\\nminus 3 times negative 7 is negative 21. So it becomes minus\\nnegative 21 is to be greater than\\nor equal to 25. This is the same thing as\\n5 plus 21-- subtracting a negative same thing as\\nadding the positive-- is greater than or equal to 25. And 5 plus 21 is 26 is indeed\\ngreater than or equal to 25. So this works out. So this is a solution. And just to see if\\nwe can visualize this a little bit better, I'm\\ngoing to graph this inequality. I'm not going to show you\\nexactly how I do it this time, but I'm going to show you\\nwhere these points lie relative to this solution. So we have 5-- let me\\ndo this is a new color. So we have 5x-- that's\\nnot a new color. Having trouble\\nswitching colors today. We have 5x minus 3y is\\ngreater than or equal to 25. Let me write this\\ninequality in kind of our slope-intercept form. So this would be the same thing. If we subtract 5x\\nfrom both sides, we get negative\\n3y is greater than or equal to negative 5x plus 25. I just subtracted\\n5x from both sides. So that gets eliminated, and you\\nhave a negative 5x over here. Now let's divide both\\nsides of this equation, or I should say this\\ninequality, by negative 3. And when you divide both\\nsides of an inequality by a negative number, multiply\\nor divide by a negative number, it swaps the inequality. So if you divide both\\nsides by negative 3, you get y is less than or\\nequal to negative 5 divided by negative 3 is 5 over 3x. And then 25 divided by\\nnegative 3 is minus 25/3. So this is now the\\nexpression or the inequality, y is less than or equal\\nto 5/3 x minus 25/3. So if I wanted to\\ngraph this-- I'll try to draw a relatively\\nrough graph here, but really just so that\\nwe can visualize this. So our y-intercept\\nis negative 25/3. That's the same thing\\nas negative 8 and 1/3. So that's 1, 2,\\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and a little bit more than 8. So our y-intercept is\\nnegative 8 and 1/3 like that. And it has a slope of 5/3. So that means for every 3 it\\ngoes to the right, it rises 5. So it goes 1, 2, 3, it rises 5. So the line is going to\\nlook something like this. I'm drawing a very\\nrough version of it. So the line will look something\\nlike that, this line over here. That's if it was a y is\\nequal to 5/3 x minus 25/3. But here we have an inequality. It's y is less than or equal to. So for any x, the y's that\\nsatisfy it are the y's that equals 5/3 x minus 25/3--\\nthat would be on the line, so it would be\\nthat point there-- and all the y's less than it. So the solution is this\\nwhole area right over here. Since it's less than or equal\\nto, we can include the line. The equal to allows us\\nto include the line, and the less than tells us we're\\ngoing to go below the line. And we can verify\\nthat by looking at these two points over here. We saw that 3 comma 5 is\\nnot part of the solution. So 3 comma 5 is 1, 2--\\nit's right about there and then up 5. So 3 comma 5 is\\nright above here. It's in this region\\nabove the line, and notice not part\\nof the solution. And then 1 comma negative 7 is\\ngoing to be right over here. It's almost on the line. So 1 comma negative 7 is\\ngoing to be right over there. But it is, at least,\\nwithin this solution area. So hopefully that gives\\nyou a little bit more sense of how to visualize\\nthese things. And we'll cover this in more\\ndetail in future videos. \",\n",
       " '7.1.2': \"Is two comma five a solution of this system? And we have a system of inequalities right over here. We have Y is greater than or equal to 2x plus 1 and X is greater than 1. In order for two comma five to be a solution of this system, it just has to satisfy both inequalities. So, lets just try it out. So when X is equal to two and Y is equal to five, it has to satify both of these. So lets try it with the first one. So if we assume X is two and Y is five, we would get an inequality that says that five is greater than or equal to two times two plus one. X is two; Y is five. This gives us five is greater than or equal to two times two is four plus one is five. Y is greater than or equal to five. That's true! Five is equal to five. So that equal part of the greater than or equal saves us. That definitely satisfies the first inequality. Lets see the second one. X needs to be greater than one. So in two comma five, X is two. So two is greater than one. So it actually satisfies both of these inequalities. So two comma five is a solution for this system. \",\n",
       " '7.2.1': \"Let's graph ourselves\\nsome inequalities. So let's say I had the\\ninequality y is less than or equal to 4x plus 3. On our xy coordinate plane, we\\nwant to show all the x and y points that satisfy this\\ncondition right here. So a good starting point might\\nbe to break up this less than or equal to, because we\\nknow how to graph y is equal to 4x plus 3. So this thing is the same thing\\nas y could be less than 4x plus 3, or y could be\\nequal to 4x plus 3. That's what less than\\nor equal means. It could be less\\nthan or equal. And the reason why I did that on\\nthis first example problem is because we know how\\nto graph that. So let's graph that. Try to draw a little bit\\nneater than that. So that is-- no, that's\\nnot good. So that is my vertical\\naxis, my y-axis. This is my x-axis,\\nright there. And then we know the\\ny-intercept, the y-intercept is 3. So the point 0, 3-- 1, 2,\\n3-- is on the line. And we know we have\\na slope of 4. Which means if we go 1 in the\\nx-direction, we're going to go up 4 in the y. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So it's going to\\nbe right here. And that's enough\\nto draw a line. We could even go back\\nin the x-direction. If we go 1 back in the\\nx-direction, we're going to go down 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. So that's also going to be\\na point on the line. So my best attempt at drawing\\nthis line is going to look something like-- this\\nis the hardest part. It's going to look something\\nlike that. That is a line. It should be straight. I think you get the idea. That right there is the graph\\nof y is equal to 4x plus 3. So let's think about what it\\nmeans to be less than. So all of these points\\nsatisfy this inequality, but we have more. This is just these\\npoints over here. What about all these where\\ny ix less than 4x plus 3? So let's think about\\nwhat this means. Let's pick up some\\nvalues for x. When x is equal to 0,\\nwhat does this say? When x is equal to 0, then that\\nmeans y is going to be less than 0 plus 3.\\ny is less than 3. When x is equal to negative 1,\\nwhat is this telling us? 4 times negative 1 is negative\\n4, plus 3 is negative 1. y would be less than negative 1. When x is equal to 1, what\\nis this telling us? 4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7. So y is going to\\nbe less than 7. So let's at least try\\nto plot these. So when x is equal to-- let's\\nplot this one first. When x is equal to 0, y is less than 3. So it's all of these points\\nhere-- that I'm shading in in green-- satisfy that\\nright there. If I were to look at this one\\nover here, when x is negative 1, y is less than negative 1. So y has to be all of these\\npoints down here. When x is equal to 1,\\ny is less than 7. So it's all of these\\npoints down here. And in general, you take any\\npoint x-- let's say you take this point x right there. If you evaluate 4x plus 3,\\nyou're going to get the point on the line. That is that x times 4 plus 3. Now the y's that satisfy it,\\nit could be equal to that point on the line, or it\\ncould be less than. So it's going to go\\nbelow the line. So if you were to do this for\\nall the possible x's, you would not only get all the\\npoints on this line which we've drawn, you would get all\\nthe points below the line. So now we have graphed\\nthis inequality. It's essentially this line, 4x\\nplus 3, with all of the area below it shaded. Now, if this was just a less\\nthan, not less than or equal sign, we would not include\\nthe actual line. And the convention to do that is\\nto actually make the line a dashed line. This is the situation if we were\\ndealing with just less than 4x plus 3. Because in that situation, this\\nwouldn't apply, and we would just have that. So the line itself wouldn't have\\nsatisfied it, just the area below it. Let's do one like that. So let's say we have y is\\ngreater than negative x over 2 minus 6. So a good way to start-- the\\nway I like to start these problems-- is to just graph\\nthis equation right here. So let me just graph-- just for\\nfun-- let me graph y is equal to-- this is the same\\nthing as negative 1/2 minus 6. So if we were to graph it, that\\nis my vertical axis, that is my horizontal axis. And our y-intercept\\nis negative 6. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that's my y-intercept. And my slope is negative 1/2. Oh, that should be an x there,\\nnegative 1/2 x minus 6. So my slope is negative 1/2,\\nwhich means when I go 2 to the right, I go down 1. So if I go 2 to the right,\\nI'm going to go down 1. If I go 2 to the left, if\\nI go negative 2, I'm going to go up 1. So negative 2, up 1. So my line is going\\nto look like this. My line is going to\\nlook like that. That's my best attempt\\nat drawing the line. So that's the line\\nof y is equal to negative 1/2 x minus 6. Now, our inequality is not\\ngreater than or equal, it's just greater than negative x\\nover 2 minus 6, or greater than negative 1/2 x minus 6. So using the same logic as\\nbefore, for any x-- so if you take any x, let's say that's\\nour particular x we want to pick-- if you evaluate negative\\nx over 2 minus 6, you're going to get that\\npoint right there. You're going to get the\\npoint on the line. But the y's that satisfy this\\ninequality are the y's greater than that. So it's going to be not that\\npoint-- in fact, you draw an open circle there-- because you\\ncan't include the point of negative 1/2 x minus 6. But it's going to be all the\\ny's greater than that. That'd be true for any x. You take this x. You evaluate negative 1/2 or\\nnegative x over 2 minus 6, you're going to get this\\npoint over here. The y's that satisfy it are\\nall the y's above that. So all of the y's that satisfy\\nthis equation, or all of the coordinates that satisfy this\\nequation, is this entire area above the line. And we're not going to\\ninclude the line. So the convention is to make\\nthis line into a dashed line. And let me draw-- I'm trying\\nmy best to turn it into a dashed line. I'll just erase sections of\\nthe line, and hopefully it will look dashed to you. So I'm turning that solid line\\ninto a dashed line to show that it's just a boundary, but\\nit's not included in the coordinates that satisfy\\nour inequality. The coordinates that satisfy our\\nequality are all of this yellow stuff that I'm shading\\nabove the line. Anyway, hopefully you\\nfound that helpful. \",\n",
       " '7.2.2': \"We're asked to graph the\\ninequality y is less than 3x plus 5. So if you give us any x-- and\\nlet me label the axes here. So this is the x-axis. This is the y-axis. So this is saying you\\ngive me an x. So let's say we take x is\\nequal to 1 right there. 3 times 1 plus 5. So 3 times x plus 5. So 3 times 1 is 3 plus 5 is 8. So one, two, three, four,\\nfive, six, seven, eight. This is saying that y\\nwill be less than 8. y will be less than\\n3 times 1 plus 5. So the y-values that satisfy\\nthis constraint for that x are going to be all of these\\nvalues down here. Let me do it in a\\nlighter color. It'll be all of these values. For x is equal to 1, it'll be\\nall the values down here, and it would not include\\ny is equal to 8. Y has to be less than 8. Now, if we kept doing that, we\\nwould essentially just to graph the line of y is equal to\\n3x plus 5, but we wouldn't include it. We would just include everything\\nbelow it, just like we did right here. So we know how to graph just\\ny is equal to 3x plus 5. Let me write it over here. So if I were to write y is equal\\nto 3x plus 5, we would say, OK, 3 is the slope. Slope is equal to 3, and then\\n5 is the y-intercept. Now, I could just graph the\\nline, but because that won't be included in the y's that\\nsatisfy this constraint, I'm going to graph it as\\na dotted line. So we'll start with the\\ny-intercept of 5. So one, two, three,\\nfour, five. That's the y-intercept. And the slope is 3. So if you go over to\\nthe 1, you go up 3. So let me do that in that\\ndarker purple color. So it'll look like this. It will look like that. That point would be on it. That point would be on it. If you go back, you're going\\nto go down by 3. So that point will be on it,\\nthat point, and that point, and I'll just connect the\\ndots with a dotted line. That dotted line is the graph\\nof y is equal to 3x plus 5, but we're not going\\nto include it. So that's why I made it a dotted\\nline because we want all of the y's that are\\nless than that. So for any x-- so\\nyou pick an x. Let's say x is equal\\nto negative 1. If you evaluate 3x plus 5 for\\nthat x, you'd get here. But we only care about\\nthe y's that are strictly less than that. So you don't include the line. It's everything below it. So for any x you pick, it's\\ngoing to be below that line. You take the x, go up to that\\nline and everything below it. So for all of the x's, it's\\ngoing to be this entire area. Let me draw it a little\\nbit neater than that. It's going to be this entire\\narea that's under the line. I'll do it in this orange. It's a little bit\\neasier to see. So this entire area under the\\nline is y is less than 3x. \",\n",

So if I went back 4, if delta\\nx was negative 4, if delta x is equal to negative\\n4, then delta y is equal to positive 2. And once again, delta y over\\ndelta x would be positive 2 over negative 4, which\\nis also negative 1/2. I just want to reinforce that\\nit's not dependent on how far I move along in x or whether\\nI go forward or backward. You're always going to get or\\nyou should always get, the same slope. It's negative 1/2. So the equation of that line\\nis y is equal to the slope, negative 1/2x, plus the\\ny-intercept, minus 2. That's the equation of this\\nline right there. Now, this inequality includes\\nthat line and everything above it for any x value. Let's say x is equal to 1. This line will tell us-- well,\\nlet's take this point so we get to an integer. Let's say that x\\nis equal to 2. Let me get rid of that 1. When x is equal to 2, this\\nvalue is going to give us negative 1/2 times 2, which is\\nnegative 1, minus 2, is going to give us negative 3. But this inequality isn't just\\ny is equal to negative 3. y would be negative 3 or all\\nof the values greater than negative 3. I know that, because\\nthey shaded in this whole area up here. So the equation, or, as I should\\nsay, the inequality that fits the graph here below\\nis-- and I'll do it in a bold color-- is y is greater\\nthan or equal to negative 1/2x minus 2. That is the inequality that is\\ndepicted in this graph, where this is just the line, but we\\nwant all of the area above and equal to the line. So that's what we have\\nfor the inequality. \",\n",
       " '7.2.4': \"Graph the solution\\nset for this system. It's a system of inequalities. We have y is greater than x\\nminus 8, and y is less than 5 minus x. Let's graph the solution set\\nfor each of these inequalities, and then essentially\\nwhere they overlap is the solution set for the\\nsystem, the set of coordinates that satisfy both. So let me draw a\\ncoordinate axes here. So that is my x-axis, and\\nthen I have my y-axis. And that is my y-axis. And now let me draw\\nthe boundary line, the boundary for this\\nfirst inequality. So the boundary line\\nis going to look like y is equal to x minus 8. But it's not going\\nto include it, because it's only\\ngreater than x minus 8. But let's just graph x minus 8. So the y-intercept\\nhere is negative 8. When x is 0, y is\\ngoing to be negative 8. So just go negative 1,\\nnegative 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So that is negative 8. So the point 0, negative\\n8 is on the line. And then it has a slope of 1. You don't see it right there,\\nbut I could write it as 1x. So the slope here\\nis going to be 1. I could just draw a line\\nthat goes straight up, or you could even say that it'll\\nintersect if y is equal to 0, if y were equal to 0,\\nx would be equal to 8. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And so this is x is equal to 8. If it has a slope\\nof 1, for every time you move to the right 1,\\nyou're going to move up 1. So the line is going to\\nlook something like this. And actually, let me not\\ndraw it as a solid line. If I did it as a\\nsolid line, that would actually be this\\nequation right here. But we're not going\\nto include that line. We care about the y values that\\nare greater than that line. So what we want to do\\nis do a dotted line to show that that's just\\nthe boundary, that we're not including that in\\nour solution set. Let me do this in a new color. So this will be the\\ncolor for that line, or for that inequality,\\nI should say. So that is the boundary line. And this says y is\\ngreater than x minus 8. So you pick an x,\\nand then x minus 8 would get us on\\nthe boundary line. And then y is greater than that. So it's all the y values above\\nthe line for any given x. So it'll be this region above\\nthe line right over here. And if that confuses\\nyou, I mean, in general I like to just\\nthink, oh, greater than, it's going to be above the line. If it's less than, it's\\ngoing to be below a line. But if you want\\nto make sure, you can just test on either\\nside of this line. So you could try the\\npoint 0, 0, which should be in our solution set. And if you say, 0 is\\ngreater than 0 minus 8, or 0 is greater than\\nnegative 8, that works. So this definitely should\\nbe part of the solution set. And you could try something\\nout here like 10 comma 0 and see that it doesn't work. Because you would have 10 minus\\n8, which would be 2, and then you'd have 0. And 0 is not greater than 2. So when you test\\nsomething out here, you also see that it won't work. But in general, I\\nlike to just say, hey look, this is\\nthe boundary line, and we're greater than the\\nboundary line for any given x. Now let's do this one over here. Let's do this one. The boundary line for\\nit is going to be y is equal to 5 minus x. So the boundary line is\\ny is equal to 5 minus x. So once again, if x\\nis equal to 0, y is 5. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And then it has a\\nslope of negative 1. We could write this as y is\\nequal to negative 1x plus 5. That's a little bit\\nmore traditional. So once again, y-intercept at 5. And it has a slope\\nof negative 1. Or another way to think\\nabout it, when y is 0, x will be equal to 5. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So every time we move\\nto the right one, we go down one because we\\nhave a negative 1 slope. So it will look like this. And once again, I want\\nto do a dotted line because we are-- so\\nthat is our dotted line. And I'm doing a\\ndotted line because it says y is less than 5 minus x. If it was y is\\nequal to 5 minus x, I would have included the line. If it was y is less than\\nor equal to 5 minus x, I also would have\\nmade this line solid. But it's only less than,\\nso for any x value, this is what 5\\nminus x-- 5 minus x will sit on that boundary line. But we care about the y values\\nthat are less than that, so we want everything\\nthat is below the line. And once again, you can test\\non either side of the line. 0, 0 should work for this\\nsecond inequality right here. 0 is indeed less than 5 minus 0. 0 is less than 5. And then you could try\\nsomething like 0, 10 and see that it doesn't\\nwork, because if you had 10 is less than 5 minus\\n0, that doesn't work. So it is everything\\nbelow the line like that. And like we said,\\nthe solution set for this system are all\\nof the x's and y's, all of the coordinates that\\nsatisfy both of them. So all of this shaded\\nin purple satisfies the second inequality. All of this shaded in green\\nsatisfies the first inequality. So the stuff that satisfies\\nboth of them is their overlap. So it's all of this\\nregion in blue. Hopefully this isn't\\nmaking it too messy. All of this region in blue\\nwhere the two overlap, below the magenta dotted\\nline on the left-hand side, and above the\\ngreen magenta line. That's only where they overlap. So it's only this\\nregion over here, and you're not including\\nthe boundary lines. \",\n",
       " '7.2.5': \"We're asked to determine the\\nsolution set of this system, and we actually have three\\ninequalities right here. A good place to start is just to\\ngraph the solution sets for each of these inequalities and\\nthen see where they overlap. And that's the region of the\\nx, y coordinate plane that will satisfy all of them. So let's first graph y is equal\\nto 2x plus 1, and that includes this line, and then\\nit's all the points greater than that as well. So the y-intercept\\nright here is 1. If x is 0, y is 1, and\\nthe slope is 2. If we move forward in the\\nx-direction 1, we move up 2. If we move forward 2, we'll\\nmove up 4, just like that. So this graph is going to look\\nsomething like this. Let me graph a couple more\\npoints here just so that I make sure that I'm drawing\\nit reasonably accurately. So it would look something\\nlike this. That's the graph of y is\\nequal to 2x plus 1. Now, for y is greater than or\\nequal, or if it's equal or greater than, so we have to put\\nall the region above this. For any x, 2x plus 1 will be\\nright on the line, but all the y's greater than that\\nare also valid. So the solution set of that\\nfirst equation is all of this area up here, all of the area\\nabove the line, including the line, because it's greater\\nthan or equal to. So that's the first inequality\\nright there. Now let's do the second\\ninequality. The second inequality is y\\nis less than 2x minus 5. So if we were to graph 2x minus\\n5, and something already might jump out at you\\nthat these two are parallel to each other. They have the same slope. So 2x minus 5, the y-intercept\\nis negative 5. x is 0, y is negative 1, negative 2, negative\\n3, negative 4, negative 5. Slope is 2 again. And this is only less than,\\nstrictly less than, so we're not going to actually\\ninclude the line. The slope is 2, so it will\\nlook something like that. It has the exact same slope\\nas this other line. So I could draw a bit of a\\ndotted line here if you like, and we're not going to include\\nthe dotted line because we're strictly less than. So the solution set for this\\nsecond inequality is going to be all of the area\\nbelow the line. For any x, this is 2x minus 5,\\nand we care about the y's that are less than that. So let me shade that in. So before we even get to this\\nlast inequality, in order for there to be something that\\nsatisfies both of these inequalities, it has to be in\\nboth of their solution sets. But as you can see, their\\nsolutions sets are completely non-overlapping. There's no point on the x, y\\nplane that is in both of these solution sets. They're separated by this kind\\nof no-man's land between these two parallel lines. So there is actually\\nno solution set. It's actually the null set. There's the empty set. Maybe we could put an empty set\\nlike that, two brackets with nothing in it. There's no solution set\\nor the solution set of the system is empty. We could do the x is\\ngreater than 1. This is x is equal to 1, so\\nwe put a dotted line there because we don't want\\ninclude that. So it would be all\\nof this stuff. But once again, there's nothing\\nthat satisfies all three of these. This area right here satisfies\\nthe bottom two. This area up here satisfies\\nthe last one and the first one. But there's nothing that\\nsatisfies both these top two. Empty set. \",\n",

Ezra has a total of 11 liters\\nof water for these plants. In the following inequality, S represents the number\\nof sunflower plants and L represents the number of lily plants Ezra can water. See if this makes sense. So it looks like... So the number of sunflower plants is S and he would have to use\\n7/10 of a liter per plant. So this first term right over here, this is how much water used to water the sunflower plants and then the second term is how much water used to water the lily plants cause he needs half a liter\\nfor each of the L lily plants. And he has a total of 11 liters. So the sum right over here has to be less than or equal to 11. Alright. Ezra waters 10 lily plants. So that's L is equal to 10. How many sunflower plants\\ncan he water at most with the remaining amount of water? Well let's think about this a little bit. We have 0.7, 0.7 times the number of\\nsunflower plants he waters. Plus, plus... So we're gonna assume L is equal to 10. He waters 10 lily plants and each of them, he\\ngives half a liter to. So 0.5, 0.5 x 10 is going to be 5. So it's gonna be five liters,\\nwatering the 10 lily plants and this has to be less\\nthan or equal to 11. So we can try to isolate\\nthe S on the left hand side. So let's, let's do that.\\nThe number of sunflowers. So we could first subtract\\nfive from both sides. Subtract five from both sides. and we are going to be left with... We are going to be left\\nwith on the left hand side, we're gonna just have 0.7 x S So this expression is\\nthe total amount of water he's gonna spend on the sunflower plants has to be less than or equal to 11- 5 is equal to six. And so now, we can\\ndivide both sides by 0.7 And we're gonna have to\\nchange the inequality because we are diving by\\na positive number, 0.7 So we're gonna get S... S is less than or equal to 6 ÷ 0.7 or we could even write this as... we could write this as, well... This is 6 divided by 0.7 Let me write everything as a fraction. This is the same thing as 6 ÷ 7/10 which is equal to six times 10 over seven which is equal to 60/7 which is equal to what is this? 8 4/7 so S has to be less than\\neight and four sevenths. Now assuming that he's only, we're only thinking in\\nterms of whole plants... (mumbles) integer numbers but actually\\nwhole numbers of plants and so, if S has to be less than 8 4/7, how many sunflower plants can he water at most with the\\nremaining amount of water? Well, we'll say that he had, most he can water eight plants. We're gonna assume that he can't water just a fraction of a plant. He either waters something or he doesn't. So he's gonna water eight, he is gonna water eight plants. Cause that's the largest whole number that is less than 8 4/7. That satisfies... That is less than or equal\\nto 8 4/7 I should say. \",\n",

The exact same number of\\ncomments for each cat video and the exact same number\\nfor each dog video. But we\\'ll just assume\\nwhat they\\'re telling us. \"In the following inequality, C represents \"the number of cat videos, C for cat, \"and D represents the\\nnumber of dog videos, \"D for dog, dog videos\\nthat Goku should upload \"to achieve his goal.\" So 750 times the number of cat videos plus 450 times the number of dog videos needs to be greater than 9000. \"According to the inequality, \"how many comments does each cat video get \"and how many comments\\ndoes each dog video get?\" So let\\'s see if we understand\\nwhat\\'s going over here, what\\'s going on in this inequality\\nto answer their question. So he wants to get over 9000 comments and we see that right over here. He wants to get over 9000 comments. So this we could view as a number of comments that he actually gets. Since we have some number times C, we can assume that, well C, well we know that C is\\na number of cat videos and so the number times C, that\\'s the number of comments that he gets from cat videos. And on a per cat video bases, he\\'s going to get 750 comments. Because if I say, \"Hey, look. \"I have C cat videos and on each of them, \"I have exactly 750 comments.\" Well, I\\'m gonna have 750 times C comments on all of my cat videos combined. So each cat video gets 750 comments. And similarly, I can never say that, each dog video gets, well this is the total number\\nof comments from dog videos. You add all of these together. Your total number of comments w to be greater than 9000. Well, if the total from\\ndog videos is 450 D, then we see he\\'s getting\\n450 comments per dog video. 450 comments per video times\\nthe number of dog videos gets the total comments from dog videos. So he gets 450 comments per dog video. \"Can Goku achieve this goal\\nby uploading eight cat videos \"and seven dog videos?\" So let\\'s think about this. Eight cat videos, seven dog videos.

If we have 750, let me\\ndo those in same colors, if we have 750 times eight, times eight plus 450 times seven, is this greater than, I\\'m writing the question\\nmark so we don\\'t know, is this going to be greater than 9000? Well, we just have to evaluate this. What is this going to be? Let\\'s see. 700 times eight is 5600. It\\'s going to be 5600 plus another 50 times eight is 400. So 5600 plus 400 is 60 hundred or 6000. So this is 6000 right over here. So that would be, if he\\nhas eight cat videos, he gets 750 comments per video so he\\'s going to have a\\ntotal of 6000 comments on all of the eight cat videos combined. And then 450 times seven, let\\'s see, 400 times seven is 2800 plus another 30, plus another 350, that\\'s going to be, what? 3150, is that right? Let\\'s see, that would be, let me show you to this right, 2800 plus 400 times seven is 2800. 50 times seven is 350. Yep, I think that is right. It all, all works out, 3150. So 6000 plus 3150 is\\nindeed greater than 9000. It is indeed greater than 9000. This over here is 9150 which is indeed greater than 9000.

       " '7.3.4': \"Luis receives a gift card\\nworth $25 to an online retailer that sells digital\\nmusic and games. Each song costs $0.89 and\\neach game costs $1.99. He wants to buy at least 15\\nitems with this card. Set up a system of inequalities\\nthat represents this scenario and identify the\\nrange of possible purchases using a graph. And that's why we have some\\ngraph paper over here. So let's define some\\nvariables. Let's let s equal the number\\nof songs he buys. And then let's let g equal the\\nnumber of games that he buys. Now if we look at this\\nconstraint right here, he wants to buy at least 15\\nitems with this card. So the total number of items are\\ngoing to be the number of songs plus the number\\nof games. And that has to be\\nat least 15. So it has to be greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So that's what that constraint\\ntells us right there. And then the other constraint is\\nthe gift card is worth $25. So the amount that he spends on\\nsongs plus the amount that he spends on games has to be\\nless than or equal to 25. So the amount that he spends on\\nsongs are going to be the number of songs he buys times\\nthe cost per song. Times $0.89 times-- so I will\\nsay 0.89-- times s. That's how much he spends on\\nsongs plus the cost per game, which is $1.99 times the\\nnumber of games. This is going to be the total\\namount that he spends. And that has to be less\\nthan or equal to 25. Now if we want to graph these,\\nwe first have to define the axes, so let me do\\nthat right here. And we only care about the first\\nquadrant because we only care about positive values for\\nthe number of songs and the number of games. We don't talk about scenarios\\nwhere he buys a negative number of songs or games. So just the positive quadrant\\nright here. Let me draw the axes. So let's make the vertical axis\\nthat I'm drawing right here, let's make that the\\nvertical axis and let's call that the song axis. So that's the number\\nof songs he buys. Let me make sure you\\ncan see that. That is the song axis. And then let's make this, this\\nhorizontal, that's going to be the number of games he buys. Let's bold it in. And just to make sure that we\\ncan fit on this page-- because I have a feeling we're going\\nto get to reasonably large numbers-- let's make each of\\nthese boxes equal to 2. So this would be 4, 8, 12, 16,\\n20, so on and so forth. And this would be 4-- this\\nobviously would be 0-- 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and so on. So let's see if we can graph\\nthese two constraints. Well, this first constraint, s\\nplus g is going to be greater than or equal to 15. The easiest way to think about\\nthis-- or the easiest way to graph this is to really think\\nabout the intercepts. If g is 0, what is s? Well, s plus 0 has to be greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So if g is 0, s is going to be\\ngreater than or equal to 15. Let me put it this way. So if I'm going to graph\\nthis one right here. If g is 0, s is greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So g is 0, s, 15, let's see,\\nthis is 12, 14, 15 is right over there. And s is going to be all of the\\nvalues equivalent to that or greater than for\\ng equal to 0. If s is equal to 0, g is greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So if s is equal to 0, g is\\ngreater than or equal to 15. So g is greater than\\nor equal to 15. So the boundary line, s plus g\\nis equal to 15, we would just have to connect these\\ntwo dots. Let me try my best to\\nconnect these dots. So it would look something\\nlike this. This is always the\\nhardest part. Let me see how well I can\\nconnect these two dots. Nope. Let me see. I should get a line\\ntool for this. So that's pretty good. So that's the line s plus\\ng is equal to 15. And we talk about the values\\ngreater than 15, we're going to go above the line. And you saw that when g is equal\\nto 0, s is greater than or equal to 15. It's all of these\\nvalues up here. And when s was 0, g was greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So this constraint right\\nhere is all of this. All of this area\\nsatisfies this. All of this area-- if you pick\\nany coordinate here, it represents-- and really you\\nshould think about the integer coordinates, because we're not\\ngoing to buy parts of games. But if you think about all of\\nthe integer coordinates here, they represent combinations of\\ns and g, where you're buying at least 15 games. For example here, you're buying\\n8 games and 16 songs. That's 24. So you're definitely meeting\\nthe first constraint. Now the second constraint. 0.89s plus 1.99g is less\\nthan or equal to 25. This is a starting point. Let's just draw the line 0.89s\\nplus 1.99 is equal to 25. And then we could think about\\nwhat region the less than would represent. Oh, 1.99g. And the easiest way to do this,\\nonce again, we could do slope y-intercept all\\nthat type of thing. But the easiest way is to\\njust find the s- and the g-intercepts. So if s is equal to 0 then we\\nhave 1.99g is equal to 25 or g is equal to-- let's get a\\ncalculator out for this. So if we take 25 divided\\nby 1.99, it is 12.56. g is equal to 12.56. So when s is 0, let\\nme plot this. When s is 0, g is 12.56. This is 12, this is 14. 12.56 is going to be right\\nthere, a little bit more than 12. That's that value there. And then let's do the same\\nthing if g is 0. So if g is equal to 0, then we\\nhave-- so this term goes away-- we have 0.89s. If we use just the equality\\nhere, the equation-- is equal to 25 or s is equal to-- get\\nthe calculator out again. So if we take 25 divided\\nby 0.89, we get-- it's equal to 28.08. Just a little over 28. So 28.08. So that is, g is 0, s is 28. So that is 2, 4, 24, 6, 8. A little over 28. So it's right over there. So this line, 0.89s plus 1.99g\\nis equal to 25 is going to go from this coordinate,\\nwhich is 0, 28. So that point right there. All the way down to\\nthe point 12.56,0. So let me see if I\\ncan draw that. It's going to go-- I'll draw\\nup one more attempt. Maybe if I start from the\\nbottom it'll be easier. That was a better attempt. Let me bold that in a little\\nbit, so you can make sure you can see it. So that line represents\\nthis right over here. Now if we're talking about the\\nless than area, what would that imply? So if we think about it, when\\ng is equal to 0, 0.89s is less than 25. So when g is equal to 0, if we\\nreally wanted the less than there, we could think\\nof it this way. It's less than instead of just\\ndoing less than or equal to. So s is less than 28.08. So it'll be the region below. When s is 0, g-- so if we think\\ns is 0, if we use this original equation, 1.99g will\\nbe less than or equal to. I use this just to plot the\\ngraph, but if we actually care about the actual inequality, we\\nget 1.99g is less than 25. g would be less than\\nor equal to 12.56. So when s is equal to 0,\\ng is less than 12.56. So the area that satisfies\\nthis second constraint is everything below this graph. Now we want the region that\\nsatisfies both constraints. So it's going to be the overlap\\nof the regions that satisfy one of the two. So the overlap is going to be\\nthis region right here.

She needs to use up, \"Shawna needs to use up at\\nleast 460 grams of sugar \"to make cupcakes and muffins, \"and she wants to use at\\nmost 970 grams of flour.\" So let me use another color. \"And she wants to use \"at most 970 grams of flour. \"Let\\'s form a system of inequalities \"to represent Shawna\\'s conditions. \"Let C denote the number\\nof cupcakes she makes \"and M the number of muffins she makes.\" All right, \"Write an\\ninequality that represents \"the condition based on the\\nnumber of grams of sugar.\" So the condition based on\\nthe number of grams of sugar. That\\'s what we underlined here in green. \"Shawna needs to use up at\\nleast 460 grams of sugar \"to make cupcakes and muffins.\" So let\\'s see how we can write that out. So how much sugar she\\'s\\ngonna use for the cupcakes? Well, we\\'re told right over here she requires 35 grams\\nof sugar per cupcake. So the amount of sugar\\nthat she\\'s going to use for all of the cupcakes is going to be 35 grams per cupcake, let me write that a little bit neater, 35 grams per cupcake times\\nthe number of cupcakes. So this is how much sugar total she\\'s going to use on the cupcakes. 35 grams per cupcake times the number of cupcakes. And then how many grams of sugar is she going to use for the muffins? Well, that\\'s going to be 30\\ngrams of sugar per muffin. So plus 30 grams of sugar per muffin times the number of muffins. So times M. So this is the total\\nsugar from the cupcakes. This is the total sugar from the muffins. And so if you add them together, this is a total sugar that she\\'s using and we\\'re told that she needs to use up at least 460 grams of sugar. So everything here is in grams. So this has to be greater than or equal. She needs to use at\\nleast 460 grams of sugar to make both of these. So that\\'s it. We can just set up the\\ninequality that represents the condition based on the\\nnumber of grams of sugar which is this condition right over here. Now let\\'s see, this next question. Let\\'s see, \"Write an\\ninequality that represents \"the condition based on the\\nnumber of grams of flour.\" Well, that\\'s what we underlined\\nin orange right over here. She needs to use no at\\nmost 970 grams of flour. So no more than 970 grams. So how would we express\\nthat as an inequality? Well, how much flour is she\\ngoing to use for the cupcakes? Well, she used 50 grams\\nof flour per cupcake. So 50 grams per cupcake\\ntimes the number of cupcakes. That\\'s how much flour she\\'s\\ngoing to use for the cupcakes. And then for the muffins, she uses 65 grams of flour per muffin times the number of muffins. So this is the total amount of flour that she is going to use and this has to be less\\nthan or equal to 970 grams. Less than or equal to 970 and we\\'re done. And so you could actually,\\nif you wanted to, you could say, \"What pairs of C and M \"satisfy both of these inequalities?\" And then you could say,\\n\"Okay, that\\'s the combination \"of the number of cupcakes\\nand muffins she can make \"in order to satisfy\\nher actual conditions.\" ',\n",

And it looks like she\\nuses six wooden boards for each chair and that\\'s why you take six per chair times the number of chairs. This is the total number of wooden boards she uses from the chairs. And you add them together. It can\\'t be anymore than 150. She only has, I guess 150 wooden boards. \"Additionally, the following\\ninequality represents \"the number of tables and chairs \"she can make with 330 nails.\" So once again, she has\\nthe maximum of 330 nails. It looks like she needs 34 nails per table because the total nails from the tables is 34 nails per table times\\nthe number of tables. And then it looks like she needs 27 nails. It looks like she needs 27 nails per chair because the total nails that she uses in all of the chairs\\nare 27 nails per chair times the number of chairs. \"Does Fleur have enough boards \"and nails to make three tables, \"to make three, \"to make three tables and nine chairs? \"And nine chairs?\" Let\\'s see, let\\'s look\\nat the number of boards. To make three tables and nine chairs, she\\'s going to use 17 times T. In this case, it\\'s three. Shes\\' going to use 17 times\\nthree boards for the tables and then she is going to use, she is going to use six times the number of chairs. So six times nine chairs. Six boards per chair times nine chairs. So six times nine is the number of boards she\\'s going to use on the chairs. So this is going to,\\nthis is the same thing as 17 times three is 51. 51 plus, six times nine is 54. So this is 54. And what is this? Is this less than or equal to 150? Is that less than or equal to 150? Let\\'s see, 51 plus 54 is going to be 105. So that indeed is less\\nthan or equal to 150. So that checks out. So she has more than enough boards. So she has enough boards. Let me write that. Enough boards. Now let\\'s see if she has enough nails. Let\\'s see if she has, that came out weird, enough boards. Let\\'s see if she has enough nails. So three tables are going to require 34 times three nails. So 34 nails per table times three tables. So 34 times three. That\\'s how many nails\\nfor all of the tables. And then plus, if she is going to use 27 nails per chair times the nine chairs. 27 times nine. We need to figure out, is this less than or equal to 330? And so let\\'s see. 34 times three, that is 100. No, that\\'s 90 plus 12. So that\\'s 102 and then 27 times nine. So let\\'s see, that would be, was it 243? Yep, so plus 243. So it\\'s 102 plus 243, is that less than or equal to 330? So let\\'s see, this would be, this would end up adding up to 345. No, this is not less than or equal to 330. This is not the case. This is not true. Not true. So she does not have enough nails. So not enough, not enough nails. And so she has enough\\nboards but not enough nails.

So, you want to be in the blue area. You want to be in the solution set for Inequality A, which\\nwould be the blue area or on the blue line.

       " '7.3.8': \"- [Voiceover] Diana the dog receives five dog biscuits for fetching each frisbee, and three dog biscuits\\nfor fetching each ball. Sounds like a pretty good deal. She plans to receive at most D dog biscuits before chasing her tail. Well, that's sounds reasonable. The inequality graph\\nbelow represents the set of all combinations where\\nDiana fetches F frisbees and fetches B balls in order to receive at most, at most, D dog biscuits 'cause at that point she\\nreasonably starts chasing her tail. According to the graph, we're gonna take a look at the graph in a second, according to the graph, what\\nis the most number of dog biscuits Diana wants to receive\\nbefore chasing her tail? In other words, what is D? So let's look at, let's\\ninterpret this graph properly. So if we look at the horizontal\\naxis right over here, that's F, that's the number of frisbees, the number of frisbees\\nshe catches, frisbees and this vertical axis,\\nthis is the number of balls, number of, number of balls that she gets and we know what the total number of biscuits are going to be. The total from catching frisbees,\\nif she catches F frisbees, she gets five biscuits per frisbee so the total from catching frisbees is 5F and if she catches, if she catches B balls or retrieves B balls so\\nif she gets those B balls, if she gets, what was it? Three? Three biscuits per ball? Yep! Three dog biscuits for fetching each ball, the total number of dog biscuits she gets for catching B balls is\\n3B and so the total number of biscuits she fetches is 5F plus 3B. This is the number of\\nbiscuits from frisbees. This is the number of biscuits from balls. Now we can see all of the\\nallowable combinations of number of frisbees\\nand number of balls here. And so for example, if she catches that point right over there, eight or retrieves eight balls and catches, well, that would be half of a frisbee, so that doesn't, that\\ndoesn't seem to make sense but if she retrieves eight\\nballs and catches one frisbee well, then, that's still\\nok, she still hasn't met her maximum number of biscuits yet. So how do we think about the\\nmaximum number of biscuits? Well, the maximum number of biscuits are any of these points when she, that are sitting on this line\\nand notice, the solutions that where all the points\\nit satisfies this inequality are all below this line\\nso she's hitting a maximum when she's on the line and an easy one might be this point right\\nover here where we see that, where we see that frisbees,\\nzero frisbees and 10 and 10 balls pretty much\\nmaximizes her number of biscuits. So if she catches 10 balls,\\nso let me write this down, so if B is equal to 10, B is equal to 10, F is zero, if F is equal to zero and B is equal to 10, well,\\nhow many is she going to catch? Or how many biscuits is she going to get? Well, she's going to get,\\nthis is gonna be zero and then three times 10 is 30, so that's gonna be 30\\nbiscuits, 30 biscuits. So this point right over\\nhere, this corresponds with 30 biscuits, 30 biscuits and you can see that any of these points along this blue line, actually\\ncorrespond to 30 biscuits. If you go over here, where F is six, let me write it here, F is equal to six and B is equal to zero so\\nspends all of her time, she's earns her biscuits purely through frisbee catching,\\nso this is a situation where F is equal to six\\nand B is equal to zero, you still have the same scenario, you still have, if F is\\nsix, five times six is 30 plus three times zero,\\nwe'll that's just gonna be once again, 30 biscuits, 30 biscuits. So her maximum, or the number of biscuits she needs before starts\\nchasing her tail is 30. So D is going to be 30 and\\nin fact, we can express this inequality as a 5F plus 3B has to be less than or equal to 30. Alright, then they ask\\nus another question. Can Diana fulfill her plan by fetching, can Diana fulfill her plan by fetching four frisbees and two balls? So let's see, four frisbees and two balls, this is right over here,\\nfour frisbees and two balls. So it's not, we're not saying that she has to maximize, that she\\nhas to get the 30 biscuits, she just cannot eat any\\nmore than 30 biscuits. So it seems like she can\\nfulfill her plan, let me see. The inequality graphed below\\nrepresents all the combinations where Diana fetches F frisbees and B balls in order to receive at\\nmost D dog biscuits. So let's see, is she fulfilling\\nher plan by fetching, well, yeah, I would say, yes. \",\n",

And based on what that input is,\\nit will produce a given output. What is an example\\nof a function? I could have something\\nlike f of x-- and x tends to be the variable\\nmost used for an input into the function. And the name of a\\nfunction, f tends to be the most-used variable. But we'll see that you can\\nuse others-- is equal to, let's say, x squared,\\nif x is even. And let's say it is equal\\nto x plus 5, if x is odd. What would happen if we\\ninput 2 into this function? The way that we would\\ndenote inputting 2 is that we would want\\nto evaluate f of 2. This is saying, let's input\\n2 into our function f. And everywhere we\\nsee this x here, this variable-- you can kind\\nof use as a placeholder-- let's replace it with our input. So let's see. If 2 is even, do 2 squared. If 2 is odd, do 2 plus 5. Well, 2 is even, so we're\\ngoing to do 2 squared. In this case, f of 2 is\\ngoing to be 2 squared, or 4. Now what would f of 3 be? Well, once again, everywhere\\nwe see this variable, we'll replace it with our input. So f of 3, 3 squared if 3 is\\neven, 3 plus 5 if 3 is odd. Well, 3 is odd, so it's\\ngoing to be 3 plus 5. It is going to be equal to 8. You might say, OK,\\nthat's neat, Sal. This was kind of\\nan interesting way to define a function, a way to\\nkind of munch on these numbers. But I could have done this\\nwith traditional equations in some way, especially\\nif you allowed me to use the squirrelly\\nbracket thing. What can a function do that\\nmaybe my traditional toolkits might have not been\\nas expressive about? Well, you could even do\\na function like this. Let me not use f\\nand x anymore, just to show you that the notation\\nis more general than that. I could say h of a is equal to\\nthe next largest number that starts with the same\\nletter as variable a. And we're going to assume\\nthat we're dealing in English. Given that, what is\\nh of 2 going to be? Well, 2 starts with a T.\\nWhat's the next largest number that starts with a T? Well, it's going\\nto be equal to 3. Now what would h of-- I don't\\nknow, let's think about this, h of 8 be equal to? Well, 8 starts with an E.\\nThe next largest number that starts with an E-- it's\\nnot 9, 10-- it would be 11. And so now you see it's a\\nvery, very, very general tool. This h function that we just\\ndefined, we'll look at it. We'll look at the\\nletter that the number starts with in English. So it's doing this really,\\nreally, really, really wacky thing. Now not all functions\\nhave to be this wacky. In fact, you have already\\nbeen dealing with functions. You have seen things like\\ny is equal to x plus 1. This can be viewed\\nas a function. We could write this\\nas y is a function of x, which is\\nequal to x plus 1. If you give as an\\ninput-- let me write it this way-- for example,\\nwhen x is 0 we could say f of 0 is equal to, well, you take 0. You add 1. It's equal to 1. f of 2 is equal to 2. You've already done this before. You've done things\\nwhere you said, look, let me make a table of\\nx and put our y's there. When x is 0, y is 1. I'm sorry. I made a little mistake. Where f of 2 is equal to 3. And you've done this before\\nwith tables where you say, look, x and y. When x is 0, y is 1. When x is 2, y is 3. You might say, well, what\\nwas the whole point of using the function\\nnotation here to say f of x is equal to x plus 1? The whole point is to think\\nin these more general terms. For something like\\nthis, you didn't really have to introduce\\nfunction notations. But it doesn't hurt to introduce\\nfunction notations because it makes it very clear that\\nthe function takes an input, takes my x-- in this\\ndefinition it munches on it. It says, OK, x plus 1. And then it produces\\n1 more than it. So here, whatever the input\\nis, the output is 1 more than that original function. Now I know what you're asking. All right. Well, what is not\\na function then? Well, remember,\\nwe said a function is something that takes an\\ninput and produces only one possible output for\\nthat given input. For example-- and let\\nme look at a visual way of thinking about a function\\nthis time, or a relationship, I should say-- let's\\nsay that's our y-axis, and this right over\\nhere is our x-axis. Let me draw a circle\\nhere that has radius 2. So it's a circle of radius 2. This is negative 2. This is positive 2. This is negative 2. So my circle, it's\\ncentered at the origin. It has radius 2. That's my best attempt\\nat drawing the circle. Let me fill it in. So this is a circle. The equation of\\nthis circle is going to be x squared plus y squared\\nis equal to the radius squared, is equal to 2 squared,\\nor it's equal to 4. The question is, is this\\nrelationship between x and y-- here I've expressed\\nit as an equation. Here I've visually drawn all\\nof the x's and y's that satisfy this equation-- is this\\nrelationship between x and y a function? And we can see\\nvisually that it's not going to be a function. You pick a given x. Let's say x is equal to 1. There's two possible y's\\nthat are associated with it, this y up here and\\nthis y down here. We could even solve for that\\nby looking at the equation. When x is equal to 1, we\\nget 1 squared plus y squared is equal to 4. 1 plus y squared is equal to 4. Or subtracting 1 from both\\nsides, y squared is equal to 3. Or y is equal to the positive or\\nthe negative square root of 3. This right over here is the\\npositive square root of 3, and this right over here is\\nthe negative square root of 3. So this situation,\\nthis relationship where I inputted a 1\\ninto my little box here, and associated with\\nthe 1, I associate both a positive square root of\\n3 and a negative square root of 3, this is not a function. I cannot associate with my\\ninput two different outputs. I can only have one\\noutput for a given input. \",\n",

       " '8.1.4': \"- [Instructor] What we have\\nhere is a visual depiction of a function. And this is a depiction\\nof Y is equal to H of X. Now when a lot of people see\\nfunction notation like this they see it as somewhat\\nintimidating until you realize what it's saying. All a function is, is\\nsomething that takes an input, in this case it's taking X as\\nan input and then the function does something to it and then\\nit spits out some other value which is going to be equal to Y. So for example what is H\\nof four based on this graph that you see right over here? Pause this video and think through that. Well all H of four means\\nis when I input four into my function H what\\nY am I spitting out? Or another way to think about\\nit, when X is equal to four, what is Y equal to? Well when X is equal to four,\\nmy function spits out that Y is equal to three. We know that from this\\npoint right over here, so Y is equal to three, so H\\nof four is equal to three. Let's do another example. What is H of zero? Pause the video try to work that through. Well all this is saying is\\nif I input an X equals zero into the function what is going\\nto be the corresponding Y? Well when X equals zero we\\nsee that Y is equal to four. So it's as simple as that. Given the input what is\\ngoing to be the output? And that's what these points\\nrepresent, each of these points represent a different\\noutput for a given input. Now it's always good to keep\\nin mind one of the things that makes it a function is\\nthat for given X that you input you only get one Y. For example if we had two dots\\nhere, then all of a sudden or we have two dots for X\\nequals six, now all of a sudden we have a problem\\nfiguring out what H of six would be equal to because\\nit could be equal to one or it could be equal to three. So if we had this extra dot\\nhere, then this would no longer be a function. In order for it to be a\\nfunction for any given X, it has to output a unique\\nvalue, it can't output two possible values. Now the other way is possible. It is possible to have two\\ndifferent X's that output the same value. For example, if this was circled\\nin what would H of negative four be? Well H of negative four when\\nX is equal to negative four, you put that into our function\\nit looks like the function would output two. So H of negative four\\nwould be equal to two. But H of two is also equal\\nto we see very clearly there, when we input a two into the\\nfunction, the corresponding Y value is two as well. So it's okay for two\\ndifferent X values to map to the same Y value that works. But if you had some type of\\nan arrangement, some type of a relationship where\\nfor a given X value you had two different Y values,\\nthen that would no longer be a function. But the example they gave\\nus is a function assuming I don't modify it. \",\n",

So g of x equaling to negative 2 means y of x is equal to negative 2 And so when does y equal negative 2? (muttering) when does equal negative 2? (talking) it looks like that happens right at this point. And that happens when you input negative 9 into g. g of negative 9 is negative 2 so this is going to be negative 9. And we're done. \",\n",
       " '8.2.3': \"The graph of the function \\nf is shown below. What is the input value\\nother than negative five for which f of x is equal\\nto f of negative five? So, we have our x axis,\\nwe have our y axis. And then in blue, they've \\ngraphed y equals f of x. So for example when \\nx is equal to one, f of x, when y is going to be equal \\nto f of x --that's what this graph is-- f of x is equal to one. When x is equal to seven, \\nf of seven, we see, is equal to five. When x is equal to nine, we see\\nthat f of nine is equal to six. So what is the input value\\nother than negative five for which f of x is equal to\\nf of negative five? So, let's see. If x is equal to negative five,\\nf of negative five is... -- we move up here to the graph-- It is equal to four. Cause this, once again, is the \\ngraph y is equal to f of x. So the y coordinate here, this is what f of x, this is what \\nfive of negative five is equal to. So f of negative five is equal to four. So where else does that happen? So let's see. Let's just move horizontally to the right. That happens here as well. So what input do we have to give? What's the x coordinate here to get y is equal to f of x or f of x is\\nequal to four right over here? Well, we see the x \\ncoordinate is also four. So this tells us that f of four\\nis equal to four, which is the same thing as\\nf of negative five. So when x is four, the function\\ntakes on the same value as when x is negative five. So x equals four. And we are done. \",\n",

SALMAN KHAN: And now\\nyou're with us, luckily, for the summer, doing\\na whole bunch of stuff as a teaching fellow. JESSE ROE: Yeah, as\\na teaching fellow I've been helping with\\norganizing and developing new content, mostly on the\\nexercise side of the site. SALMAN KHAN: And the reason\\nwhy we're doing this right now is you had some very\\ninteresting ideas or questions. JESSE ROE: Yeah, so\\nas an algebra teacher, when I introduce that concept\\nof algebra to students, I get a lot of questions. One of those\\nquestions is, what's the difference between an\\nequation and a function? SALMAN KHAN: The difference\\nbetween an equation verses a function, that's an\\ninteresting question. Let's pause it and\\nlet the viewers try to think about\\nit a little bit. And then maybe we'll\\ngive a stab at it. JESSE ROE: Sounds great. So Sal, how would you\\nanswer this question? What's the difference between\\nan equation and a function? SALMAN KHAN: Let me think\\nabout it a little bit. So let me think. I think there's\\nprobably equations that are not functions\\nand functions that are not equations. And then there are probably\\nthings that are both. So let me think of it that way. So I'm going to draw-- if\\nthis is the world of equations right over here, so\\nthis is equations. And then over here is\\nthe world of functions. That's the world of functions. I do think there\\nis some overlap. We'll think it through\\nwhere the overlap is, the world of functions. So an equation that is not a\\nfunction that's sitting out here, a simple one would\\nbe something like x plus 3 is equal to 10. I'm not explicitly talking\\nabout inputs and outputs or relationship\\nbetween variables. I'm just stating an equivalence. The expression x plus\\n3 is equal to 10. So this, I think, traditionally\\nwould just be an equation, would not be a function. Functions essentially\\ntalk about relationships between variables. You get one or more\\ninput variables, and we'll give you only\\none output variable. I'll put value. And you can define a function. And I'll do that in a second. You could define a\\nfunction as an equation, but you can define a function\\na whole bunch of ways. You can visually\\ndefine a function, maybe as a graph-- so\\nsomething like this. And maybe I actually\\nmark off the values. So that's 1, 2, 3. Those are the\\npotential x values. And then on the\\nvertical axis, I show what the value of my\\nfunction is going to be, literally my function of x. And maybe that is 1, 2, 3. And maybe this\\nfunction is defined for all non-negative values. So this is 0 of x. And so let me just draw--\\nso this right over here, at least for what I've drawn\\nso far, defines that function. I didn't even have\\nto use an equal sign. If x is 2, at least the way\\nI drew it, y is equal to 3. You give me that input. I gave you the value\\nof only one output. So that would be a legitimate\\nfunction definition. Another function\\ndefinition would be very similar to what you\\ndo in a computer program, something like, let's say, that\\nyou input the day of the week. And if day is equal to Monday,\\nmaybe you output cereal. So that's what we're\\ngoing to eat that day. And otherwise, you\\noutput meatloaf. So this would also\\nbe a function. We only have one output. For any one day of\\nthe week, we can only tell you cereal or meatloaf. There's no days where you\\nare eating both cereal and meatloaf, which\\nsounds repulsive. And then if I were to\\nthink about something that could be an\\nequation or a function, I guess the way I think about\\nit is an equation is something that could be used\\nto define a function. So for example, we could say\\nthat y is equal to 4x minus 10. This is a potential\\ndefinition for defining y as a function of x. You give me any value of x. Then I can find the\\ncorresponding value of y. So this is at least how\\nI would think about it. \",\n",
       " '8.3.2': 'For a given input value b, the function f outputs a value a to satisfy the\\nfollowing equation 4a plus 7b is equal to negative 52. So for a given input b, the function f, the function f\\nwill output an a that satisfies this\\nrelationship right over here for the a and the b. Write a formula for f of b in terms of b. So we want to do,\\nwe just want to solve for -- if we\\'re given a \"b\", what \"a\" does that\\nimply that we have to output? Or another way to think about it is\\n-- let\\'s just solve for a, or we could think about a as being a\\nfunction of b. So let\\'s write this. So we have 4a plus 7b -- is equal to negative 52. So I can solve for a in terms of b, that any b that I have --\\nLet\\'s say these b\\'s are on the right hand side I can put it in. I can substitute that value\\nfor b and I can just solve for a. I can solve for a that needs to be\\noutputted. So let\\'s do that. Let\\'s solve for a. \\nSo I want to get all the a on I wanna just have an a leftover on the\\nleft hand side, and have everything else on the right hand side including the b\\'s. So let\\'s get rid of this b on the left hand\\nside. And I can do that by subtracting 7b.\\nOf course I wanna do that to both sides. I can\\'t just do an equation and do an operation only on one side like\\nthat. So let\\'s subtract, and we are left with\\nwe are left with -- the 7b\\'s add up to zero. 7b minus 7b.\\nWe\\'re left with 4a is equal to negative 52 minus 7b, minus 7b. Now, to isolate the a here,\\njust to have an a here instead of 4a, we can divide both sides by 4. We can\\ndivide both sides by 4. So I\\'m gonna divide everything by 4. And on the left hand side, we got\\nour goal. We are left with an a is equal to -- Now\\nwhat\\'s negative 54 divided by -- What is the negative 52 divided by 4?\\nSo let\\'s think about it. 52 is 40 plus 12. 40 divided by\\n4 is 10. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So it\\'s gonna be 13. Negative 13.\\nSo it\\'s negative 13 minus 7/4 b minus 7/4 b. So given a \"b\", if you give me a \"b\", I can put\\nthat value right over here, and I can calculate what the\\ncorresponding a needs to be in order to satisfy this relationship. So if I want a formula for f of b in\\nterms of b, I can say, look, you give me a \"b\", the output of our\\nfunction, which is f of a. The output of our function is\\ngoing to be -- is going to be negative 13 minus 7/4 b, because the output of our\\nfunction needs to be an \"a\" that will satisfy -- that will satisfy this equation up here. So hopefully that helped. ',\n",
       " '8.4.1': \"Arjun opened up a savings account last\\nyear and put an initial sum in it. Let M of t\\ndenote the account balance M measured in dollars t days since it was opened. What does\\nthe statement M of 30 minus M of 0 equalling a hundred mean?\\nBefore I look at the choices, let's think about what this means. When you input t equals 30 into your\\nfunction, you're going to get M of 30.\\nSo let me make that clear. So if you say t is equal to 30, you input that into your\\nfunction M. You're going to get -- you're going to\\nget M of 30. So one way to think about it\\nis -- This is the account balance 30 days\\nsince it was opened. This is when t is equal to 30. This is the account balance\\nafter 30 days Let's write that down. Balance -- balance after 30 days. Now, by the same logic, this\\nright over here this is when we put t where we said t equals 0. This is the balance\\nafter 0 days, or you could say this is the initial balance. initial -- initial balance. So what they're doing -- they're taking our\\nbalance after 30 days, and from that they're subtracting the initial\\nbalance and they're saying that equal to 100. So there's a couple ways you can\\ninterpret this and I haven't even looked at these choices yet. We'll see if\\nany of these match up. You could say that your balance after 30\\ndays is a hundred dollars more than the initial balance. Or another way to think about is\\nyou added a hundred dollars in the first 30 days. Those are both legitimate ways to think\\nabout it. I'll see which of these choices are consistent with that. 30 days after it was\\nopened, the balance of Arjun's account was equal to 100. No, that's not what that's\\nsaying. This statement right over here -- the\\nbalance 30 days after opening -- this statement right over here -- this\\nwould be equivalent. This is equivalent to saying that, M of 30 -- this is the balance after 30\\ndays after it was opened -- is equal to 100. That's not what they tell us here.\\nThey tell us that the difference between the balance after 30 days and\\nthe initial balance -- that's a hundred. So we can rule that one out. Arjan had\\nthe initial amount of money in his account 30 days after he opened it. So if he had\\nthe same amount -- if he had the initial amount -- let me write this down. So had the initial\\namount of money -- the initial amount of money is M of 0. So they're saying he had the\\ninitial amount of money in his account 30 days after he opened it. Well, the amount\\nthat he had in his account 30 days after he opened it is M of 30. So these are the same amounts of money\\nthen this -- In order to be consistent with this,\\nyou would have an equation like this. M of 0, the initial amount, is equal to the amount after 30 days.\\nThat's not what they told us over here. We can rule that out. And then finally we have the choice Arjan made a profit\\nover a hundred dollars over the first 30 days since the account\\nwas opened. That seems reasonable that his balance\\nis a hundred dollars higher. The difference between -- if you take the initial\\nbalance and subtract it from his balance after 30 days, it's a hundred. And this right over here is a\\nhundred higher than his initial balance. So it makes sense that maybe he got the\\nprofit out of an interest or something else that he got in his bank account over the\\nfirst 30 days. \",\n",

So this is saying that the number of people\\nfive hours past midnight is less than the number of people nine\\nhours past midnight at Copacabana beach. So the number of people\\nfive hours past midnight is less than the number people nine\\nhours past midnight. Let's get into these choices.

       " '8.5.1': '- [Voiceover] What I hope\\nto do in this video is get familiar with the notion of an interval, and also think about ways\\nthat we can show an interval, or interval notation. Right over here I have a number line. Let\\'s say I wanted to talk\\nabout the interval on the number line that goes from\\nnegative three to two. So I care about this-- Let\\nme use a different color. Let\\'s say I care about this\\ninterval right over here. I care about all the numbers\\nfrom negative three to two. So in order to be more\\nprecise, I have to be clear. Am I including negative three and two, or am I not including\\nnegative three and two, or maybe I\\'m just including one of them. So if I\\'m including\\nnegative three and two, then I would fill them in. So this right over here, I\\'m\\nfilling negative three and two in, which means that\\nnegative three and two are part of this interval. And when you include the endpoints, this is called a closed interval. Closed interval. And I just showed you how I can depict it on a number line, by actually\\nfilling in the endpoints and there\\'s multiple ways to talk about this interval mathematically. I could say that this is all of the... Let\\'s say this number line is showing different values for x. I could say these are all of the x\\'s that are between negative three and two. And notice, I have negative\\nthree is less than or equal to x so that\\'s telling us\\nthat x could be equal to, that x could be equal to negative three. And then we have x is less\\nthan or equal to positive two, so that means that x could\\nbe equal to positive two, so it is a closed interval. Another way that we could\\ndepict this closed interval is we could say, okay, we\\'re\\ntalking about the interval between, and we can use brackets because it\\'s a closed interval, negative three and two, and once again I\\'m using brackets here,\\nthese brackets tell us that we include, this\\nbracket on the left says that we include negative three,\\nand this bracket on the right says that we include\\npositive two in our interval. Sometimes you might see things written a little bit more math-y. You might see x is a member of\\nthe real numbers such that... And I could put these curly\\nbrackets around like this. These curly brackets say that we\\'re talking about a set of values, and we\\'re saying that the set of all x\\'s that are a member of the real number, so this is just fancy math notation, it\\'s a member of the real numbers. I\\'m using the Greek letter\\nepsilon right over here. It\\'s a member of the\\nreal numbers such that. This vertical line here means \"such that,\" negative three is less x is less than-- negative three is less than or equal to x, is less than or equal to two. I could also write it this way. I could write x is a\\nmember of the real numbers such that x is a member,\\nsuch that x is a member of this closed set, I\\'m\\nincluding the endpoints here. So these are all\\ndifferent ways of denoting or depicting the same interval. Let\\'s do some more examples here. So let\\'s-- Let me draw\\na number line again. So, a number line. And now let me do-- Let me\\njust do an open interval. An open interval just so that we clearly can see the difference. Let\\'s say that I want to talk about the values between negative one and four. Let me use a different color. So the values between\\nnegative one and four, but I don\\'t want to include\\nnegative one and four. So this is going to be an open interval. So I\\'m not going to include four, and I\\'m not going to include negative one. Notice I have open circles here. Over here had closed circles,\\nthe closed circles told me that I included negative three and two. Now I have open circles here,\\nso that says that I\\'m not, it\\'s all the values in\\nbetween negative one and four. Negative .999999 is going to be included, but negative one is not\\ngoing to be included. And 3.9999999 is going to be included, but four is not going to be included. So how would we-- What would be the notation for this? Well, here we could say\\nx is going to be a member of the real numbers\\nsuch that negative one-- I\\'m not going to say less than or equal to because x can\\'t be equal to negative one, so negative one is strictly less than x, is strictly less than four. Notice not less than or\\nequal, because I can\\'t be equal to four, four is not included. So that\\'s one way to say it. Another way I could write it like this. x is a member of the\\nreal numbers such that x is a member of... Now the interval is from\\nnegative one to four but I\\'m not gonna use these brackets. These brackets say, \"Hey,\\nlet me include the endpoint,\" but I\\'m not going to include them, so I\\'m going to put the\\nparentheses right over here. Parentheses. So this tells us that we\\'re\\ndealing with an open interval. This right over here,\\nlet me make it clear, this is an open interval. Now you\\'re probably\\nwondering, okay, in this case both endpoints were included,\\nit\\'s a closed interval. In this case both endpoints were excluded, it\\'s an open interval. Can you have things that\\nhave one endpoint included and one point excluded, and\\nthe answer is absolutely. Let\\'s see an example of that. I\\'ll get another number line here. Another number line. And let\\'s say that we want to-- Actually, let me do it\\nthe other way around. Let me write it first,\\nand then I\\'ll graph it. So let\\'s say we\\'re thinking\\nabout all of the x\\'s that are a member of the\\nreal numbers such that let\\'s say negative four is\\nnot included, is less than x, is less than or equal to negative one. So now negative one is included. So we\\'re not going to\\ninclude negative four. Negative four is strictly less than, not less than or equal to, so x can\\'t be equal to negative\\nfour, open circle there. But x could be equal to negative one. It has to be less than\\nor equal to negative one. It could be equal to negative one so I\\'m going to fill\\nthat in right over there. And it\\'s everything in between. If I want to write it with\\nthis notation I could write x is a member of the\\nreal numbers such that x is a member of the interval, so it\\'s going to go between\\nnegative four and negative one, but we\\'re not including negative four. We have an open circle here so I\\'m gonna put a\\nparentheses on that side, but we are including negative one. We are including negative one. So we put a bracket on that side. That right over there\\nwould be the notation. Now there\\'s other things that you could do with interval notation. You could say, well hey,\\neverything except for some values. Let me give another example. Let\\'s get another example here. Let\\'s say that we wanna talk\\nabout all the real numbers except for one. We want to include all\\nof the real numbers. All of the real numbers except for one. Except for one, so we\\'re gonna\\nexclude one right over here, open circle, but it can\\nbe any other real number. So how would we denote this? Well, we could write x is a\\nmember of the real numbers such that x does not equal one. So here I\\'m saying x can be\\na member of the real numbers but x cannot be equal to one. It can be anything else, but\\nit cannot be equal to one. And there\\'s other ways of\\ndenoting this exact same interval. You could say x is a\\nmember of the real numbers such that x is less than one, or x is greater than one. So you could write it just like that. Or you could do something interesting. This is the one that I would\\nuse, this is the shortest and it makes it very clear. You say hey, everything except for one. But you could even do something\\nfancy, like you could say x is a member of the real\\nnumbers such that x is a member of the set going from\\nnegative infinity to one, not including one, or x is a\\nmember of the set going from-- or a member of the\\ninterval going from one, not including one, all\\nthe way to positive, all the way to positive infinity. And when we\\'re talking\\nabout negative infinity or positive infinity, you\\nalways put a parentheses. And the view there is you\\ncould never include everything all the way up to infinity. It needs to be at least\\nopen at that endpoint because infinity just\\nkeeps going on and on. So you always want to put\\na parentheses if you\\'re talking about infinity\\nor negative infinity. It\\'s not really an endpoint, it keeps going on and on forever. So you use the notation for open interval, at least at that end, and\\nnotice we\\'re not including, we\\'re not including one\\neither, so if x is a member of this interval or that interval, it essentially could be\\nanything other than one. But this would have been\\nthe simplest notation to describe that. ',\n",
       " '8.5.2': \"Let's have a little bit of a review of what\\na function is before we talk about what it means that what the domain of a function means.\\nSo function we can view as something -- so I put a function in this box\\nhere and it takes inputs, and for a given input, it's going to\\nproduce an output which we call f of x. So, for example, let's say that\\nwe have the function -- let's say we have the function f of x is equal to 2 over x. So in this case if -- let me see -- that's my function f. If I were to input the number 3. Well, f of 3 that we're going to output -- we have, we\\nknow how to figure that out. We've defined it right over here. It's going to be\\nequal to 2 over 3. It's going to be equal to 2 over 3. So we're able, for that input, we're\\nable to find an output. If our input was pi, then we input into our function and then\\nf of pi -- when x is pi, we're going to output\\nf of pi, which is equal to 2 over pi. So we\\ncould write this as 2 over pi. We're able to find the output\\npretty easily. But I want to do something interesting. Let's attempt to input 0 into the function. If we input 0 then\\nthe function tells us what we need to output. Does this\\ndefinition tell us what we need to output? So if I attempt to put x equal 0, then this\\ndefinition would say f of 0 be 2 over 0, but 2 over 0 is\\nundefined. Rewrite this -- 2 over 0. This is undefined.\\nThis function definition does not tell us what to actually do with 0. It gives us an\\nundefined answer. So this function is not defined here.\\nIt gives a question mark. So this gets to the essence of what domain is. Domain is the set of all inputs over\\nwhich the function is defined. So the domain of this\\nfunction f would be all real numbers except for x equals 0. So we write down these, these big ideas.\\nThis is the domain -- the domain of a function -- Actually let me write that out. The domain of a function A domain of a function is the set of all inputs -- inputs over which the function is defined -- over which the function is defined,\\nor the function has defined outputs over which the function has defined outputs. So the domain for this f\\nin particular -- so the domain for this one  -- if I want\\nto say its domain, I could say, look, it's going to\\nbe the set of these curly brackets. These are kind of typical mathy set notation. I said OK\\n, it could be the set of -- I gonna put curly brackets like that. Well, x can be a\\nmember So this little symbol means a\\nmember of the real numbers. But it can't be any real number. It could be most of the real numbers except it\\ncannot be 0 because we don't know -- this definition is undefined when\\nyou put the input as 0 So x is a member of the real numbers,\\nand we write real numbers -- we write it with this kind of double stroke right over here.\\nThat's the set of all real numbers such that -- we have to put\\nthe exception. 0 is not a -- x equals to 0 is not a member of that\\ndomain -- such that x does not -- does not equal 0. Now let's make this a little bit\\nmore concrete by do some more examples So more examples we do, hopefully the clearer this will become.\\nSo let's say we have another function. Just be clear, we don't\\nalways have to use f's and x's. We could say, let's say we\\nhave g of y is equal to the square root of y minus 6. So what is the domain here? What is the set of all inputs over which this function g\\nis defined? So here we are in putting a y it to function g and we're gonna output g of y. Well it's going to be defined\\nas long as whatever we have under the radical right over here is non-negative. If this becomes a\\nnegative, our traditional principal root operator here is not defined. We need something that --\\nif this was a negative number, how would you take the principal\\nroot of a negative number? We just think this is kind of the the\\ntraditional principal root operator. So y minus 6, y minus 6 needs to be greater than or equal to 0, in order for, in order for g\\nto be defined for that input y. Or you could say add six to both sides.\\ny is to be greater than or equal 6. Or you could say g is defined for any inputs\\ny that are greater than or equal to 6. So you could say the domain here, we\\ncould say the domain here is the set of all y's that are members of\\nthe real numbers such that y, such that they're also\\ngreater than or equal, such that they're also greater than or equal to 6. So hopefully\\nthis is starting to make some sense -- You're all used to a function that is\\ndefined this way. You could even see functions that are divided fairly exotic ways. You could see a\\nfunction -- let me say h of x -- h of x could be defined as -- it literally\\ncould be defined as, well h of x is gonna be 1 if x is equal to pi and it's equal to 0 if, if, x is equal to 3. Now what's the domain\\nhere? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Well, this function is actually only\\ndefined for two input. If you, we know h of -- we know h of pi --\\nif you input pi into it we know you're gonna output 1, and\\nwe know that if you input 3 into it h of 3, when x equals 3, you're going to\\n-- you're going to -- put some commas here. You're gonna get 0.\\nBut if you input anything else, what's h of 4 going to be? Well, it hasn't defined. It's undefined.\\nWhat's h of negative 1 going to be? It hasn't defined. So the domain, the domain here, the domain of h is literally -- it's just literally\\ngoing to be the the two valid inputs that x can be are 3 and pi. These are the only valid inputs.\\nThese are the only two numbers over which this function is actually defined.\\nSo this hopefully starts to give you a flavor of why we care about to the domain.\\nIt's not all functions are defined over all real numbers. Some are defined \\nfor only a small subset of real numbers, or for some other\\nthing, or only whole numbers, or natural numbers, or positive numbers, and negative\\nnumbers. So they have exceptions. So we'll see that as we do\\nmore and more examples. \",\n",
       " '8.5.3': '- As a little bit of\\na review, we know that if we have some function,\\nlet\\'s call it \"f\". We don\\'t have to call it\\n\"f\", but \"f\" is the letter most typically used for functions, that if I give it an input, a valid input, if I give it a valid input,\\nand I use the variable \"x\" for that valid input, it is\\ngoing to map that to an output. It is going to map that, or produce, given this x, it\\'s going\\nto product an output that we would call \"f(x).\" And we\\'ve already talked a little bit about the notion of a domain. A domain is the set of all of the inputs over which the function is defined. So if this the domain here,\\nif this is the domain here, and I take a value here,\\nand I put that in for x, then the function is\\ngoing to output an f(x). If I take something that\\'s\\noutside of the domain, let me do that in a different color... If I take something that\\nis outside of the domain and try to input it into this function, the function will say, \"hey, wait wait,\" \"I\\'m not defined for that thing\" \"that\\'s outside of the domain.\" Now another interesting\\nthing to think about, and that\\'s actually what\\nthe focus of this video is, okay, we know the set of\\nall of the valid inputs, that\\'s called the domain,\\nbut what about all, the set of all of the\\noutputs that the function could actually produce? And we have a name for that. That is called the range of the function. So the range. The range, and the most typical, there\\'s actually a couple\\nof definitions for range, but the most typical definition for range is \"the set of all possible outputs.\" So you give me, you input\\nsomething from the domain, it\\'s going to output\\nsomething, and by definition, because we have outputted\\nit from this function, that thing is going to be in the range, and if we take the set\\nof all of the things that the function could output, that is going to make up the range. So this right over here is\\nthe set of all possible, all possible outputs. All possible outputs. So let\\'s make that a\\nlittle bit more concrete, with an example. So let\\'s say that I have the function f(x) defined as, so once again,\\nI\\'m gonna input x\\'s, and I have my function f,\\nand I\\'m gonna output f(x). And let\\'s say this def... The function definition\\nhere, the thing that tries to figure out, \"okay, given an\\nx, what f(x) do I produce?\", the definition says \"f(x)\\nis going to be equal\" \"to whatever my input is, squared.\" Well, just as a little bit of review, we know what the domain\\nhere is going to be. The domain is the set of all valid inputs. So what are the valid inputs here? Well, I could take any real number and input into this, and I\\ncould take any real number and I can square it, there\\'s\\nnothing wrong with that, and so the domain is all real numbers. All, all real, all real numbers. But what\\'s the range? Maybe I\\'ll do that in a different color just to highlight it. What is going to be the range here, what is the set of all possible outputs? Well if you think about, actually, to help us think about, let\\nme actually draw a graph here. Of what this looks like. What this looks like. So the graph of \"f(x)\\nis equal to x squared\" is going to look something like this. So, it\\'s gonna look, it\\'s going\\nto look something like this. I\\'m obviously hand-drawing\\nit, so it\\'s not perfect. It\\'s gonna be a parabola with a, with a vertex right here at the origin. So this is the graph, this is the graph, \"y is equal to f(x),\" this\\nof course is the x-axis, this of course is the y-axis. So let\\'s think about it, what is the set of all possible outputs? Well in this case, the set\\nof all possible outputs is the set of all possible y\\'s here. Well, we see, y can take\\non any non-negative value. y could be zero, y could one,\\ny could be pi, y could be e, but y cannot be negative. So the range here is, the range... We could, well we could\\nsay it a couple of ways, we could say, \"f(x)\",\\nlet me write it this way. \"f(x) is a member of the real numbers\" \"such that, is such that\\nf(x) is greater than\" \"or equal to zero.\" We could write it that\\nway, if we wanted to write it in a less mathy notation, we could say that \"f(x) is going to be\" \"greater than or equal to zero.\" f(x) is not going to be negative, so any non-negative number, the set of all non-negative numbers, that is our range. Let\\'s do another example of this, just to make it a little bit,\\njust to make it a little bit, a little bit clearer. Let\\'s say that I had,\\nlet\\'s say that I had g(x), let\\'s say I have g(x),\\nI\\'ll do this in white, let\\'s say it\\'s equal\\nto \"x squared over x.\" So we could try to\\nsimplify g(x) a little bit, we could say, \"look, if I have x squared\" \"and I divide it by x, that\\'s gonna,\" \"that\\'s the same thing as\\ng(x) being equal to x.\" \"x squared over x\" is x,\\nbut we have to be careful. Because right over here, we have to, in our domain, x cannot be equal to zero. If x is equal to zero,\\nwe get zero over zero, we get indeterminate form. So in order for this function\\nto be the exact same function, we have to put that,\\n\\'cause it\\'s not obvious now from the definition, we have to say, \"x cannot be equal to zero.\" So g(x) is equal to x for any x as long as x is not equal to zero. Now these two function\\ndefinitions are equivalent. And we could even graph it. We could graph it, it\\'s going to look, I\\'m gonna do a quick and\\ndirty version of this graph. It\\'s gonna look something like, this. It\\'s gonna have a slope of one, but it\\'s gonna have a hole right at zero, \\'cause it\\'s not defined at zero. So it\\'s gonna look like this. So the domain here, the domain of g is going to be, \"x is a\\nmember of the real numbers\" \"such that x does not equal zero,\" and the range is actually\\ngoing to be the same thing. The range here is going to be, we could say \"f(x) is a\\nmember of the real numbers\" \"such that f(x) does not equal zero.\" \"f(x) does not equal zero.\" So the domain is all real\\nnumbers except for zero, the range is all real\\nnumbers except for zero. So the big takeaway here is\\nthe range is all the pos... The set of all possible\\noutputs of your function. The domain is the set of all valid inputs into your function. ',\n",
       " '8.5.4': \"The function f of x is graphed. What is its domain? So the way it's graphed\\nright over here, we could assume that this\\nis the entire function definition for f of x. So for example, if\\nwe say, well, what does f of x equal when x\\nis equal to negative 9? Well, we go up here. We don't see it's graphed here. It's not defined for x\\nequals negative 9 or x equals negative 8 and 1/2 or\\nx equals negative 8. It's not defined for\\nany of these values. It only starts getting defined\\nat x equals negative 6. At x equals negative 6,\\nf of x is equal to 5. And then it keeps\\ngetting defined. f of x is defined for x all\\nthe way from x equals negative 6 all the\\nway to x equals 7. When x equals 7, f\\nof x is equal to 5. You can take any x value\\nbetween negative 6, including negative\\n6, and positive 7, including positive\\n7, and you just have to see-- you\\njust have to move up above that number,\\nwherever you are, to find out what the value of\\nthe function is at that point. So the domain of this\\nfunction definition? Well, f of x is\\ndefined for any x that is greater than or\\nequal to negative 6. Or we could say negative 6\\nis less than or equal to x, which is less than\\nor equal to 7. If x satisfies this\\ncondition right over here, the function is defined. So that's its domain. So let's check our answer. Let's do a few more of these. The function f of x is graphed. What is its domain? Well, exact similar argument. This function is not defined\\nfor x is negative 9, negative 8, all the way down or all the way\\nup I should say to negative 1. At negative 1, it\\nstarts getting defined. f of negative 1 is negative 5. So it's defined for negative\\n1 is less than or equal to x. And it's defined all the\\nway up to x equals 7, including x equals 7. So this right over\\nhere, negative 1 is less than or equal to x\\nis less than or equal to 7, the function is\\ndefined for any x that satisfies this double\\ninequality right over here. Let's do a few more. The function f of x is graphed. What is its range? So now, we're not\\nthinking about the x's for which this\\nfunction is defined. We're thinking about\\nthe set of y values. Where do all of the\\ny values fall into? Well, let's see. The lowest possible y value\\nor the lowest possible value of f of x that we get\\nhere looks like it's 0. The function never goes below 0. So f of x-- so 0 is less\\nthan or equal to f of x. It does equal 0 right over\\nhere. f of negative 4 is 0. And then the highest y\\nvalue or the highest value that f of x obtains in this\\nfunction definition is 8. f of 7 is 8. It never gets above 8, but it\\ndoes equal 8 right over here when x is equal to 7. So 0 is less than f of x, which\\nis less than or equal to 8. So that's its range. Let's do a few more. This is kind of fun. The function f of x is graphed. What is its domain? So once again, this function\\nis defined for negative 2. Negative 2 is less than or\\nequal to x, which is less than or equal to 5. If you give me an x anywhere\\nin between negative 2 and 5, I can look at this graph to see\\nwhere the function is defined. f of negative 2 is negative 4. f of negative 1 is negative 3. So on and so forth,\\nand I can even pick the values in\\nbetween these integers. So negative 2 is less than or\\nequal to x, which is less than or equal to 5. \",\n",
       " '8.6.1': \"- [Instructor] We're asked\\nto determine for each x-value whether it is in the domain of f or not. And they have our definition\\nof f of x up here. So pause this video and see\\nif you can work through this before we do it together. All right, so just as a bit of a review, if x is in the domain of our function, that means that if we input\\nour x into our function, when we are going to get a\\nlegitimate output f of x. But if for whatever reason\\nf isn't defined at x or it gets some kind of undefined state, well, then x would not be in the domain. So let's try these different values. Is x equal to negative\\nfive in the domain of f? Well, let's see what happens if we try to evaluate f of negative five. Well, then in the numerator,\\nwe get negative five plus five. Every place where we see an x, we replace it with a negative five. So it's negative five plus five, over negative five minus\\nthree, which is equal to in our numerator, we get zero, and in our denominator,\\nwe get negative eight. Now, at first you see the zero, and you might get a little bit worried, but it's just a zero in the numerator, so this whole thing just\\nevaluates to a zero, which is a completely legitimate output. So x equals negative\\nfive is in the domain. What about x equals zero? Is that in the domain? Pause the video. See if you can figure that out. Well, f of zero is going to be equal to in our numerator, we have zero plus five, and in our denominator,\\nwe have zero minus three. Well, that's just going to\\nget us five in the numerator and negative three in the denominator. This would just be negative 5/3. But this is a completely\\nlegitimate output. So the function is\\ndefined at x equals zero, so it's in the domain for sure. Now what about x equals three? Pause the video and\\ntry to figure that out. Well, I'll do that up here. f of three is going to be equal to what? And you might already\\nsee some warning signs as to what's going to happen\\nhere in the denominator, but I'll just evaluate the whole thing. In the numerator, we get three plus five. In the denominator, we\\nget three minus three. So this is going to be\\nequal to eight over zero. Now what is eight divided by zero? Well, we don't know. This is one of those fascinating\\nthings in mathematics. We haven't defined what happens when something is divided by zero. So three is not in the domain. The function is not defined\\nthere, not in domain. Let's do another example. Determine for each x-value whether it is in the domain of g or not. So pause this video and try to work through\\nall three of these. So first of all, when x\\nequals negative three, do we get a legitimate g of x? So let's see. g of negative three, if\\nwe try to evaluate this, that's going to be the square root of three times negative three, which is equal to the square\\nroot of negative nine. Well, with just a principle\\nsquare root like this, we don't know how to evaluate this. So this is not in the domain. What about when x equals zero? Well, g of zero is going to be equal to the square root of three times zero, which is equal to the square root of zero, which is equal to zero, so that gave us a legitimate result. So that is in the domain. Now what about g of two, or x equals two? Does that give us a legitimate g of two? Well, g of two is going to\\nbe equal to the square root of three times two, which is\\nequal to the square root of six which is a legitimate output. So x equals two is in the domain. Let's do one last example. So we're told, this h\\nof x right over here, and once again, we have\\nto figure out whether these x-values are in the domain or not. Pause this video and see if\\nyou can work through that. All right, well, let's\\njust first think about h of negative one. What's that going to be equal to? Negative one, every place we see an x, we're going to replace\\nit with a negative one, minus five, squared. Well, this is going to be\\nequal to negative six squared, negative six squared, which\\nis equal to positive 36, which is a very legitimate output, and so this is definitely in the domain. What about five? So h of five is going to be equal to five minus five squared. Now you might be getting worried 'cause you're seeing a zero here, but it's not like we're\\ntrying to divide by zero. We're just squaring zero, which is completely legitimate. So zero squared is just a zero, and so h of five is very much defined. So this is in the domain. Now what about h of 10? Well, h of 10 is going to be\\nequal to 10 minus five squared, which is equal to five\\nsquared, which is equal to 25. Once again, it's a very legitimate output. So the function is definitely\\ndefined for x equals 10, and we're done. \",\n",
       " '8.6.2': \"- [Instructor] In this video, we're gonna do a few examples finding domains of functions. So let's say that we\\nhave the function f of x is equal to x plus five over x minus two. What is going to be the domain of this function? Pause this video and\\ntry to figure that out. All right, now let's do it together. Now the domain is the set of all x values that if we input it into this function, we're going to get a legitimate output. We're going to get a legitimate f of x. And so what's a situation\\nwhere we would not get a legitimate f of x? Well, if we input an x value that makes this denominator equal to zero, then we're going to divide by zero and that's going to be undefined. And so we could say that the domain, the domain here is all real values of x, such that x minus two does not equal zero. Now typically, people\\nwould not want to just see that such that x minus\\ntwo does not equal zero, and so we can simplify this a little bit so that we just have an\\nx on the left hand side. So if we add two to both sides of this, we would get, actually,\\nlet me just do that. Let me add two to both sides. So x minus two not equaling zero is the same thing as x not equaling two, and you could have done\\nthat in your head, as well. If you wanted to keep x\\nminus two from being zero, x just can't be equal to two, and so typically, people\\nwould say that the domain here is all real values of x such that x does not equal two. Let's do another example. Let's say that we're told that g of x is equal to the principle\\nroot of x minus seven. What's the domain in this situation? What's the domain of g of x? Pause the video and\\ntry to figure that out. Well, we could say that domain, the domain is going to\\nbe all real values of x such that, are we going to have to put any constraints on this? Well when does a principle\\nroot function break down? Well if we tried to\\nfind the principle root, the square root of a negative number, well, that would then break down, and so x minus seven, whatever we have under the radical here needs to be greater than or equal to zero, so such that x minus seven needs to be greater than or equal to zero. Now another way to say\\nthat is if we add seven to both sides of that, that would be saying that\\nx needs to be greater than or equal to seven, so let me just write it that way. So such that x is greater than or equal to seven. So all I did is I said, all right, where could this thing break down? Well, if I get x values\\nwhere this thing is negative, we're in trouble, so x needs to be greater, x minus seven, whatever we have in this, under the radical needs to be greater than or equal to zero, and so if you say that x minus seven needs to be greater than or equal to zero, you add seven to both sides. You get x needs to be greater than or equal to positive seven. Let's do one last example. Let's say we're told that h of x is equal to x minus five squared. What's the domain here? So let me write this down. The domain is all real values of x. Now are we going to have to\\nconstrain this a little bit? Well, is there anything\\nthat would cause this to not evaluate to a defined value? Well, we can square any value. To give me any real\\nnumber and if I square it, I'm gonna just get another real number, and so x minus five can\\nbe equal to anything, and so x can be equal to anything. So here, the domain is\\nall real values of x. We didn't have to constrain it in any way like we did the other two. The other two, when\\nyou deal with something in the denominator that\\ncould be equal to zero, then you've got to make\\nsure that doesn't happen 'cause that would get\\nyou an undefined value and similarly, for a radical, you can't take the\\nsquare root of a negative and so we would, once again, have to constrain on that. \",\n",

Which number type is more appropriate\\nfor the domain of the function? They tell us whether it's integers or real numbers.\\nSo we just need to remind ourselves. The domain of a function, that's a\\nset of all the inputs for which the function is defined.

And let's see.\\nDefine the interval of the domain. So t. Let's see, the t would be defined up to 2 days\\nbefore she bought the plant. So I would say that t is equal to negative 2, all the way to \\n98 days. And t could be equal to negative 2. That would be\\n2 days before she bought it, or as high as 98. So let's think about it.\\nSo the interval -- I would include, I would include negative 2.\\nI would include the low point, so that's why I'm\\nusing the bracket. If I wanted t to be greater than, not greater than or equal\\nto, I would do a parentheses. But since t could be equal to negative 2, I'm gonna use the brackets. And at the high end, it's 98, and we're going to include 98. So I'm\\ngonna put the brackets there as well. So t would be a member of\\nreal numbers such that it is a member of this\\n-- of this interval right over here. So negative t-- t could\\nbe negative 2 but -- right I would say negative 2 is going to be less than\\nor equal to t, which is going to be less than or equal to 98. Let's check our answer.

Which number type is more appropriate\\nfor the domain of the function? So just to remind ourselves, what is the domain of a function? A domain is a set of all inputs over which the function is\\ndefined. So it is the set of all b's. It is the set of\\nall inputs over which p of b will produce a\\ndefined response So let's think about it. Is it integers or\\nreal numbers? So I could buy -- b could be 0 candy bars, 1 candy bars, 2 candy bars, all up to 400 candy bars. Could I -- Could I have a fractional can-- \\nCould be b 0.372 of a candy bar? Well, this is a normal candy shop. It's -- each candy bar is gonna be in its own packet. It's going to be in a discrete chunk. You're not going to be able to buy\\n0.372 of a candy bar. You can either buy a one\\nmore or none more, so you buy your 1, 2, 3 all the way up to 400.

I can actually buy 0 candy bars so I'm\\ngonna put a bracket.

       " '8.6.5': '- [Voiceover] This right\\nover here is a screenshot from a Khan Academy exercise, and it says, \"Mason stands on the 5th\\nstep of a vertical ladder. \"The ladder has 15 steps,\\nand the height difference \"between consecutive steps is 0.5 meters. \"He is thinking about moving\\nup, down, or staying put.\" Let me draw this ladder that Mason is on. It\\'s a vertical ladder, that\\'s one side of the ladder, this is the other side of the ladder, and it has 15 steps. Let me see if I can draw that. This is the first one, two, three, four. I\\'m gonna run out of space, I need to make \\'em closer together. It\\'s gonna be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. 15 steps. Let me make sure it\\'s even. The top and the bottom, and the distance between each of these, I guess you could say, steps,\\nor the rungs of the ladder, are half a meter. This distance right\\nover here is 0.5 meters. And it says that he\\'s on the 5th step of this vertical ladder. He\\'s on the 5th step, One, two, three, four, five. This is where he is right\\nnow. He\\'s on this 5th step. And he\\'s thinking about moving up, or down, or staying put. \"Let h of n denote the\\nheight above the ground h \"of Mason\\'s feet (measured in meters) \"after moving n steps (if Mason went \"down the ladder, n is negative.)\" All right, h of n. Denote the height above the ground after moving n steps. Make sure we understand this. If I were to say h of zero, what is that going to be? Well, h of zero means that\\nhe\\'s moved zero steps. He\\'s moved zero steps,\\nhe\\'s still going to be on this 5th step of the ladder. And so how high is he going to be? If he\\'s on the 5th step\\nof a vertical ladder... I\\'m assuming that there\\'s\\n0.5 from the ground. This is the ground right over here. He is one, two, three, four, five steps, each of \\'em is half a meter. Five times 0.5 is going to give us 2.5 meters, so h of zero is 2.5 meters. If I said h of one, that means he goes up. H of one means he goes up one step. Here, n would be equal to one. If he goes up one step, h of one, he\\'s going to half a meter higher, so it\\'s going to be equal to three meters. We could keep doing that for\\na bunch of different inputs. Let me write that, that\\'s going\\nto be equal to three meters. But anyway, that\\'s not what\\nthey\\'re asking us about. They\\'re saying, \"Which number\\ntype is more appropriate \"for the domain of the function?\" The domain, just as\\nreviewed, that\\'s the set of numbers that we could\\ninput into the function and get a valid output. And it\\'s clear here, see, we have to pick between integers or real numbers. Well, n, which is our input, that\\'s the number of\\nsteps he goes up or down. It could be positive or negative, but we\\'re not gonna talk about half steps. Then he\\'ll put his foot\\nin the air, right over. He has to take integer\\nvalued steps up or down. Or, I guess, he\\'s taking\\ninteger valued steps, if it\\'s positive it\\'s up,\\nif it\\'s negative it\\'s down, if it\\'s zero that means he\\'s staying put. If n is zero, that means he\\'s staying put. It\\'s not real numbers. He can\\'t move pi steps from where he is. He can\\'t move square root of\\ntwo steps from where he is. He can\\'t even move 0.25 steps, then he\\'d put his foot in the air. This is definitely going\\nto be about the integers, not the real numbers. This function right over\\nhere, the valid inputs, I want to be able to input an integer. In fact, it\\'s not even all integers, because he can\\'t go down\\nan arbitrary amount. In fact, he can\\'t go up an\\narbitrary amount either. The domain is going to\\nbe a subset of integers. Then they say, \"Define the\\ninterval of the domain.\" And we have these little toggles here... to define the interval of the domain. And let\\'s see, the lowest value for n, he can go as far as one, two, three, four, five steps down. In that case, n would be\\nequal to negative five. And then the highest value for n is if he takes one, two,\\nthree, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 steps up. And so that would be n is equal to 10. The interval of the domain, and actually I just copy and pasted this onto my scratch pad, n can be as low as negative\\nfive, and as high as 10, and it can include them as well, so I\\'m gonna use brackets. My domain would include negative five. If it didn\\'t include negative five, I would put a parentheses,\\nbut I could put brackets here, and I could put brackets there as well. Just for fun, let me actually input it into the actual exercise. I\\'m saying integers, and I\\'m as low, and I can go down five steps, and I can go up 10 steps, and 10 is also included in my interval. Then I can check my\\nanswer, and I got it right. ',\n",
       " '8.7.1': \"Determine whether the\\npoints on this graph represent a function. Now, just as a\\nrefresher, a function is really just an association\\nbetween members of a set that we call the domain\\nand members of the set that we call a range. So if I take any member of\\nthe domain, let's call that x, and I give it to the\\nfunction, the function should tell me what member of\\nmy range is associated with it. So it should point\\nto some other value. This is a function. It would not be a\\nfunction if it says, well, it could point to y. Or it could point to z. Or maybe it could point\\nto e or whatever else. This would not be a function. So this right over\\nhere not a function, because it's not clear if\\nyou input x what member of the range you're\\ngoing to get. In order for it\\nto be a function, it has to be very clear. For any input into\\nthe function, you have to be very clear\\nthat you're only going to get one output. Now, with that out of\\nthe way, let's think about this function that\\nis defined graphically. So the domains,\\nthe valid inputs, are the x values where\\nthis function is defined. So for example, it tells us\\nif x is equal to negative 1-- if we assume that this\\nover here is the x-axis and this is the\\ny-axis-- it tells us, when x is equal to negative\\n1, we should output. Or y is going to be equal to 3. So one way to write\\nthat mapping is you could say, if you\\ntake negative 1 and you input it into\\nour function-- I'll put a little f box right over\\nthere-- you will get the number 3. This is our x. And this is our y. So that seems reasonable. Negative 1 very clear\\nthat you get to 3. Let's see what happens\\nwhen we go over here. If you put 2 into the function,\\nwhen x is 2, y is negative 2. Once again, when x\\nis 2 the function associates 2 for x, which\\nis a member of the domain. It's defined for 2. It's not defined for 1. We don't know what our\\nfunction is equal to at 1. So it's not defined there. So 1 isn't part of the domain. 2 is. It tells us when\\nx is 2, then y is going to be equal to negative 2. So it maps it or associates\\nit with negative 2. That doesn't seem too\\ntroublesome just yet. Now, let's look over here. Our function is also\\ndefined at x is equal to 3. Our function associates or maps\\n3 to the value y is equal to 2. That seems pretty\\nstraightforward. And then we get to x\\nis equal to 4, where it seems like this thing\\nthat could be a function is somewhat defined. It does try to\\nassociate 4 with things. But what's interesting here\\nis it tries to associate 4 with two different things. All of a sudden in this\\nthing that we think might have been a\\nfunction, but it looks like it might\\nnot be, we don't know. Do we associate 4 with 5? Or do we associate\\nit with negative 1? So this thing right over\\nhere is actually a relation. You can have one member of\\nthe domain being related to multiple members\\nof the range. But if you do have\\nthat, then you're not dealing with a function. So once again, because of\\nthis, this is not a function. It's not clear that when\\nyou input 4 into it, should you output 5? Or should you output negative 1? And sometimes there's something\\ncalled the vertical line test that tells you whether\\nsomething is a function. When it's graphically defined\\nlike this, you literally say, OK, when x is 4, if\\nI draw a vertical line, do I intersect the function\\nat two places or more? It could be two or more places. And if you do, that means that\\nthere's two or more values that are related to that\\nvalue in the domain. There's two or more\\noutputs for the input 4. And if there are two or more\\noutputs for that one input, then you're not dealing\\nwith a function. You're just dealing\\nwith a relation. A function is a special\\ncase of a relation. Or you could view it as\\na well-behaved relation. \",\n",
       " '8.7.2': \"In the following graph,\\nis y a function of x? So in order for y to\\nbe a function of x, for any x that you input into\\nthe function, any x for which the function is defined. So let's say we have\\ny is equal to f of x. So we have our little\\nfunction machine. It should spit out\\nexactly one value of y. If it spits out multiple values\\nof y, we don't know what f of x is going to be equal to. It could be equal to any of\\nthose possible values for y. So let's see if, for this\\ngraph, whether for a given x it spits out exactly one y. Well, the function\\nseems to be only defined so the domain of this function\\nis x is equal to negative 2. That's the only place where\\nwe have a definition for it. And if we try to\\ninput negative 2 into this little black\\nbox, what do we get? Do we get exactly one thing? No. If we put in negative 2\\nhere, we could get anything. The point negative 2,\\n9 is on this relation. Negative 2, 8 is\\non this relation. Negative 2, 7; negative 2,\\n7.5; negative 2, 3.14159-- they're all on these. So if you put a negative 2 into\\nthis relation, essentially, you actually get an\\ninfinite set of values. It could be 9. It could be 3.14. It could be 8. It could be negative 8. You get an infinite\\nnumber of results.

       " '8.7.3': \"We're asked to look at\\nthe table below. From the information given,\\nis there a functional relationship between each person\\nand his or her height? So a good place to start is\\njust think about what a functional relationship means. Now, there's definitely\\na relationship. They say, hey, if you're\\nJoelle, you're 5-6. If you're Nathan, you're 4-11. If you're Stewart,\\nyou're 5-11. That is a relationship. Now, in order for it to be a\\nfunctional relationship, for every instance or every example\\nof the independent variable, you can only have one\\nexample of the value of the function for it. So if you say if this is a\\nheight function, in order for this to be a functional\\nrelationship, no matter whose name you put inside of the\\nheight function, you need to only be able to get one value. If there were two values\\nassociated with one person's name, it would not be a\\nfunctional relationship. So if I were to ask you what\\nis the height of Nathan? Well, you'd look at the table\\nand say, well, Nathan's height is 4 foot 11. There are not two heights\\nfor Nathan. There is only one height. And for any one of these people\\nthat we can input into the function, there's only one\\nheight associated with them, so it is a functional\\nrelationship. We can even see that\\non a graph. Let me graph that out for you. Let's see, the highest height\\nhere is 6 foot 1. So if we start off with one\\nfoot, two feet, three feet, four feet, five feet,\\nand six feet. And then if I were to plot the\\ndifferent names, the different people that I could put into our\\nheight function, we have-- I'll just put the first letters\\nof their names. We have Joelle, we have Nathan,\\nwe have Stewart, we have LJ, and then we have\\nTariq right there. So lets plot them. So you have Joelle, Joelle's\\nheight is 5-6, so 5-6 is right about there. Then you have Nathan. Let me do it in a\\ndifferent color. Nathan's height is 4-11. We will plot to him\\nright over there. Then you have Stewart. Stewart's height is 5-11. He is pretty close\\nto six feet. So Stewart's height-- I made him\\nlike six feet; let me make it a little lower-- is 5-11. Then you have LJ. LJ's height is 5-6. So you have two people with a\\nheight of 5-6, but that's OK, as long as for each person\\nyou only have one height. And then finally, Tariq\\nis 6 foot 1. He's the tallest guy here. Tariq is right up here\\nat 6 foot 1. So notice, for any one of the\\ninputs into our function, we only have one value, so this is\\na functional relationship. Now, you might say OK, well,\\nisn't everything a functional relationship? No! If I gave you the situation, if\\nI also wrote here-- let's say the table was like this and\\nI also wrote that Stewart is 5 foot 3 inches. If this was our table, then\\nwe would no longer have a functional relationship because\\nfor the input of Stewart, we would have\\ntwo different values. If we were to graph this, we\\nhave Stewart here at 5-11, and then all of a sudden, we would\\nalso have Stewart at 5-3. Now, this doesn't make a lot of\\nsense, so we would plot it right over here. So for Stewart, you would have\\ntwo values, and so this wouldn't be a valid functional\\nrelationship because you wouldn't know what value to give\\nif you were to take the height of Stewart. In order for this to be a\\nfunction, there can only be one value for this. You don't know in this situation\\nwhen I add this, whether it's 5-3 or 5-11. Now, this wasn't the case, so\\nthat isn't there and so we know that the height of Stewart\\nis 5-11 and this is a functional relationship. I think to some level, it might\\nbe confusing, because it's such a simple idea. Each of these values can\\nonly have one height associated with it. That's what makes\\nit a function. If you had more than one height\\nassociated with it, it would not be a function. \",\n",

So if we say y is a function\\nof x, in order for this to be a function for any x that\\nyou input into this function, you must get exactly one y.

For orders $20 or\\nmore, shipping is $7. Can the dollar\\namount of the order be represented as a\\nfunction of shipping costs? So they're saying,\\ncan the dollar amount of the order-- so can\\nthe amount of order be represented as a\\nfunction of shipping-- let me do that in\\nthat blue color costs. So if we have the shipping\\ncosts as an input, will that map to exactly--\\nfor a given input, will we get exactly one output\\nfor the amount of order? In order for this to be\\nrepresented as a function, we have to input a shipping\\ncost, a shipping cost where this relationship\\nis defined. We need to input\\na shipping cost, put it into our relationship,\\nand get exactly one dollar amount of the order in order\\nfor this to be a function. If we get multiple dollar\\namounts of the order, then the relationship, well,\\nit's still a relationship, but it's not going\\nto be a function. So let's think about it. What are the\\npossible inputs here? Well, there's only two\\npossible shipping costs. Shipping costs are\\neither going to be $4, or they're going to be $7. So let's think\\nabout what happens when we input $4 in\\nas a shipping cost. So if we input $4\\ninto our relationship, so we input $4 into our\\nlittle potential function box, so $4 into it,\\nwhat is the output? What is going to be the\\namount of the order? Well, if the shipping cost is\\n$4, the amount of the order just has to be\\nanything less than $20. So it could have been $1. It could have been $1.50. It could've been $7. It literally can take\\non any value up to $20. So it could even be $19.99. We could do a similar\\nthing if we input 7 into this relationship. If 7 was-- and I could put\\nliterally an infinite number of numbers. It could be a million dollars. So if I input 7 into\\nthis relationship that we're trying to test\\nwhether it's a function, if 7 is the shipping costs,\\nthen the order we just know is over $20, $20 or more. So it could be $20. It could be $800. It could be $1 million. There's actually an\\ninfinite number of values that it could take\\non right over here.

       " '8.8.1': \"So right over here I've\\ngraphed the function y is equal to f of x. I've graphed over this interval. It looks like it's between\\n0 and some positive value. And I want to think about the\\nmaximum and minimum points on this. So we've already talked a little\\nbit about absolute maximum and absolute minimum\\npoints on an interval. And those are pretty obvious. We hit a maximum\\npoint right over here, right at the beginning\\nof our interval. It looks like when\\nx is equal to 0, this is the absolute maximum\\npoint for the interval. And the absolute minimum\\npoint for the interval happens at the other endpoint. So if this a, this is b,\\nthe absolute minimum point is f of b. And the absolute\\nmaximum point is f of a. And it looks like\\na is equal to 0. But you're probably\\nthinking, hey, there are other interesting\\npoints right over here. This point right over\\nhere, it isn't the largest. We're not taking on--\\nthis value right over here is definitely not\\nthe largest value. It is definitely not\\nthe largest value that the function takes\\non in that interval. But relative to the\\nother values around it, it seems like a\\nlittle bit of a hill. It's larger than the other ones. Locally, it looks like a\\nlittle bit of a maximum. And so that's why this\\nvalue right over here would be called-- let's\\nsay this right over here c. This is c, so this is\\nf of c-- we would call f of c is a relative\\nmaximum value. And we're saying relative\\nbecause obviously the function takes on the other values\\nthat are larger than it. But for the x values\\nnear c, f of c is larger than all of those. Similarly-- I can\\nnever say that word. Similarly, if this point\\nright over here is d, f of d looks like a relative\\nminimum point or a relative minimum value. f of d is a relative minimum\\nor a local minimum value. Once again, over\\nthe whole interval, there's definitely\\npoints that are lower. And we hit an absolute\\nminimum for the interval at x is equal to b. But this is a relative\\nminimum or a local minimum because it's lower\\nthan the-- if we look at the x values around d,\\nthe function at those values is higher than when we get to d. So let's think about,\\nit's fine for me to say, well, you're at a\\nrelative maximum if you hit a larger\\nvalue of your function than any of the\\nsurrounding values. And you're at a\\nminimum if you're at a smaller value than any\\nof the surrounding areas. But how could we write\\nthat mathematically? So here I'll just give\\nyou the definition that really is just\\na more formal way of saying what we just said. So we say that f of\\nc is a relative max, relative maximum\\nvalue, if f of c is greater than or\\nequal to f of x for all x that-- we could say in a\\ncasual way, for all x near c. So we could write it like that. But that's not too\\nrigorous because what does it mean to be near c? And so a more rigorous\\nway of saying it, for all x that's within an\\nopen interval of c minus h to c plus h, where h is\\nsome value greater than 0. So does that make sense? Well, let's look at it. So let's construct\\nan open interval. So it looks like for\\nall of the x values in-- and you just have to\\nfind one open interval. There might be many open\\nintervals where this is true. But if we construct\\nan open interval that looks something like that,\\nso this value right over here is c plus h. That value right\\nover here c minus h. And you see that\\nover that interval, the function at c,\\nf of c is definitely greater than or equal to\\nthe value of the function over any other part\\nof that open interval. And so you could\\nimagine-- I encourage you to pause the video,\\nand you could write out what the more formal definition\\nof a relative minimum point would be. Well, we would just\\nwrite-- let's take d as our relative minimum. We can say that f of d is\\na relative minimum point if f of d is less\\nthan or equal to f of x for all x in an\\ninterval, in an open interval, between d minus h and d plus\\nh for h is greater than 0. So you can find\\nan interval here. So let's say this is d plus h. This is d minus h. The function over that\\ninterval, f of d is always less than or equal to\\nany of the other values, the f's of all of these\\nother x's in that interval. And that's why we say that\\nit's a relative minimum point. So in everyday\\nlanguage, relative max-- if the function takes\\non a larger value at c than for the x values around c. And you're at a\\nrelative minimum value if the function takes\\non a lower value at d than for the\\nx values near d. \",\n",
       " '8.8.2': \"- [Instructor] We're asked to mark all the relative extremum\\npoints in the graph below. So pause the video and see\\nif you can have a go at that, just try to maybe look at the screen and, in your head see if you can\\nidentify the relative extrema. So now let's do this together. So there's two types of relative extrema. You have your relative maximum points, and you have your relative minimum points. And a relative maximum\\npoint or relative minimum, they're relatively easy\\n(laughing) to spot out visually. You will see a relative maximum point as the high point on a hill, and the hill itself\\ndoesn't even have to be the highest hill. For example the curve\\ncould go at other parts of the domain of the function, could go to higher values. It could also look like\\nthe peak of a mountain, and once again since we're talking about the relative maximum, this mountain peak doesn't\\nhave to be the highest mountain peak. There could be higher mountains, and actually each of these peaks, each of these peaks would\\nbe a relative maximum point. Now relative minima are the opposite. They would be the bottom of your valleys. So that's a relative minimum point. This right over here is\\na relative minimum point, even if there are other\\nparts of the function that are lower. Now there's also an edge\\ncase for both relative maxima and relative minima, and that's where the graph is flat. So if you have parts\\nof your function where it's just constant, these points would actually be both. For example, if this is our x-axis right over here, that's our x-axis, if this is our y-axis right over there, and if this is x equals c, if you construct an\\nopen interval around c, you notice that the value\\nof our function at c, f of c, is at least as large as the values of the function around it. And it is also at least as small as the values of the function around it, so this point would also be considered a relative minimum point. But that's an edge case that\\nyou won't encounter as often. So with that primer out of the way, let's identify the relative extrema. So first the relative maximum points. Well that's a top of a\\nhill right over there, this is the top of a hill. You might be tempted to look\\nat that point and that point, but notice, at this point right over here, if you go to the right, you have values that are higher than it. So it's really not at the top of a hill. And right over if you go to the left, you have values that are higher than it, so it's also not the top of a hill. And what about the\\nrelative minimum points? Well this one right over here\\nis a relative minimum point. This one right over here is\\na relative minimum point. And this one over here is a relative minimum point. Now let's do an example\\ndealing with absolute extrema. So here we're told to\\nmark the absolute maximum and the absolute minimum points in the graph below. So once again, pause this video and see if\\nyou can have a go at this. So you have an absolute maximum point at let's say x equals c if and only if, so I'll write iff for if and only if, f of c is greater than or equal to f of x for all the x's in\\nthe domain of the function. And you have an absolute minimum at x equals c if and only if, iff, f of c is less than or equal to f of x for all the x's over the domain. So another way to think about it is, absolute maximum point is the high point. So over here, that is the\\nabsolute maximum point. And then the absolute\\nminimum point is interesting because in this case, it would be actually one of, it would happen at one of\\nthe endpoints of our domain. So that is our absolute max, and this right over here is our absolute, absolute min. Now once again there is an edge case that you will not see too frequently. So for example, if this function did something like this, so if it went up like this, and then it just stayed flat like this, then this would no longer be an absolute maximum point. But any of these points\\nin this flat region, because they are at least\\nas high as any other points on our entire curve, any of those could be considered\\nabsolute maximum points. But we aren't dealing with\\nthat edge case in this example, and you're less likely to see that. And so in most problems, it's pretty easy to pick out. Because the absolute\\nhighest point on the curve will often be your absolute maximum, and the absolute lowest\\npoint on your curve will be your absolute minimum. \",\n",
       " '8.9.1': \"- [Voiceover] What I\\nhope to do in this video is look at this graph y is equal to f of x and think about the intervals where this graph is positive or negative and then think about the intervals when this graph is\\nincreasing or decreasing. So first let's just think\\nabout when is this function, when is this function positive? Well positive means that the value of the function is greater than zero. It means that the value\\nof the function this means that the function is\\nsitting above the x-axis. So it's sitting above the x-axis in this place right over here that I am highlighting in\\nyellow and it is also sitting above the x-axis over here. And if we wanted to, if we wanted to write those intervals mathematically. Well let's see, let's say that this point, let's say that this point\\nright over here is x equals a. Let's say that this right\\nover here is x equals b and this right over here is x equals c. Then it's positive, it's\\npositive as long as x is between a and b. At x equals a or at x equals b the value of our function is zero but it's positive when x is between a and b, a and b or if x is greater than c. X is, we could write it\\nthere, c is less than x or we could write that\\nx is greater than c. These are the intervals when\\nour function is positive. Let me write this, f of x, f of x positive when x is in this\\ninterval or this interval or that interval. So when is f of x negative? Let me do this in another color. F of x is going to be negative. Well, it's gonna be negative\\nif x is less than a. So this is if x is less than\\na or if x is between b and c then we see that f of\\nx is below the x-axis. F of x is down here so this\\nis where it's negative. So here or, or x is between\\nb or c, x is between b and c. And I'm not saying less than or equal to because at b or c the value of\\nthe function f of b is zero, f of c is zero. That's where we are actually\\nintersecting the x-axis. So that was reasonably straightforward. Now let's ask ourselves\\na different question. When is the function\\nincreasing or decreasing? So when is f of x, f of x increasing? Well increasing, one way to\\nthink about it is every time that x is increasing then\\ny should be increasing or another way to think\\nabout it, you have a, you have a positive rate of\\nchange of y with respect to x. We could even think about it as imagine if you had a tangent line\\nat any of these points. If you had a tangent line at\\nany of these points the slope of that tangent line is\\ngoing to be positive. But the easiest way for\\nme to think about it is as you increase x you're\\ngoing to be increasing y. So where is the function increasing? Well I'm doing it in blue. So it's increasing right until we get to this point right over\\nhere, right until we get to that point over there\\nthen it starts decreasing until we get to this\\npoint right over here and then it starts increasing again. It starts, it starts increasing again. So let me make some more labels here. So let's say that this,\\nthis is x equals d and that this right over here, actually let me do that in green color, so let's say this is x equals d. Now it's not a, d, b but you\\nget the picture and let's say that this is x is equal to, x is equal to, let me redo it a little\\nbit, x is equal to e. X is equal to e. So when is this function increasing? Well it's increasing if x is\\nless than d, x is less than d and I'm not gonna say\\nless than or equal to 'cause right at x equals\\nd it looks like just for that moment the\\nslope of the tangent line looks like it would be,\\nit would be constant. We're going from increasing to decreasing so right at d we're neither\\nincreasing or decreasing. But then we're also increasing,\\nso if x is less than d or x is greater than e,\\nor x is greater than e. And where is f of x decreasing? So f of x, let me do this\\nin a different color. When is, let me pick a\\nmauve, so f of x decreasing, decreasing well it's going\\nto be right over here. It's gonna be right between d and e. Between x equals d and x equals e but not exactly at those points 'cause at both of those points you're neither increasing nor decreasing but you see right over\\nhere as x increases, as you increase your x\\nwhat's happening to your y? If you go from this point\\nand you increase your x what happened to your y? Your y has decreased. You increase your x, your y has decreased, you increase your x, y has decreased, increase x, y has decreased all the way until this point over here. So f of x is decreasing\\nfor x between d and e. So hopefully that gives\\nyou a sense of things. Notice, these aren't the same intervals. That we are, the intervals\\nwhere we're positive or negative don't perfectly coincide with when we are increasing or decreasing. So it's very important to\\nthink about these separately even though they kinda sound the same. \",\n",

And then as we go to 8 hours later, the temperature is at Zero degrees Celsius and then it hits a, it hits at least a relative maximum point or at least from what we see it could even be a Global Maximum point but based on what we see, it's definitely a relative maximum point 14 hours into this measurement at time equals 14 and then the temperature starts to go down again. So let's see, so in other words it is t hours after midnight, so this is this is at midnight This is going to be at 8:00 a.m.. This is going to be at noon and this is going to be at 2:00 p.m. And so on and so forth, but anyway. The feature, Y-intercept. So the y-intercept is right over here And we see when lowercase t when time is zero, zero hours after midnight the temperature in New York City is Negative 3 degrees Celsius So it was negative 3 degrees Celsius, at the beginning of the day Yeah, that's a true statement and especially if you consider the beginning of the day, the true beginning of the day is right at midnight so That's that one. The y-intercept tells us this true statement So positive or negative interval and these questions are a little bit tricky because you don't have to use It's the positive or the negative interval It doesn't have to be both, so if either the positive or negative interval helps you with one of these other two statements So let's see. It was getting warmer between 2:00 a.m.. and 2:00 p.m.. The temperature was above zero between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m. So let's see. If we're talking about positive or negative intervals, so we're not talking about increasing or decreasing We're talking about positive or negative intervals, so we have a negative interval Sorry, we have a negative interval from time equals zero to time equals eight What do I mean by negative interval is the temperature is negative. It goes, it's below zero And then from, time, from eight hours from 8 a.m. To what is this this would be noon, this would be 8 p.m.. From 8 a.m.. to 8 p.m. Or the 20th hour if you're taking in military time, so to speak. We see that our temperature is positive and then it dips down to negative again. So a positive or negative interval tells us when our temperature was above or below zero. And we can see we have this positive interval where the temperature was above zero between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m. So we're only using the positive interval this interval right over here where the function is positive? That means that the temperature was above zero degrees Celsius between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m. So once again we don't- It's saying either the positive or the negative interval helped us make the statement. In this case it was only the positive interval helped us make this statement, and then finally we have increasing or decreasing interval. And it was getting warmer between 2 a.m.. and 2 p.m.. It was getting warmer between 2 a.m. Which is right over here. So we see that the function is increasing as t increases so does the temperature, all the way to 2 p.m. And that, right of there, is an increasing interval. So once again we're not using an increasing and a decreasing interval, we're just using the increasing interval, the decreasing interval isn't helping us to make the statement, but the increasing interval is helping us. It's letting us make the statement. It was getting warmer between 2:00 a.m.. And 2:00 p.m. From here to here or between 2:00 a.m.. and 2:00 p.m. We see that the function itself is increasing that is an increasing Increasing interval and we got it, right \",\n",
       " '8.10.2': \"Mr. Theisen is honing his\\ndeadly three-point precision on the basketball court. For one of his shots,\\nthe height of the ball in feet as a function of\\nhorizontal distance, in feet, y of x-- so here y\\nis a function of x. So the height must\\nbe y because that's the thing that is a\\nfunction of something else. So this right over\\nhere is height. So our y-axis is going\\nto represent height. And it is a function of x. So x must represent\\nhorizontal distance because height is a function\\nof horizontal distance. So this right over here\\nis horizontal distance. Now, it's plotted below. Mr Theisen is standing\\nat x equals 0. So he's standing\\nright over here. This is Mr. Theisen, as I\\ndraw my best attempt to draw a little stick figure\\nversion of Mr. Theisen. That's not even an acceptable\\nstick figure right over there. So this is Mr. Theisen, and\\nhe's standing at x equals 0. And at x equals 0, he is\\nshooting a basketball. And you see from the\\nfunction right over here that where the graph\\nintersects the y-axis, that tells us that's essentially\\nthe height of the ball when x is equal 0, where it's\\nwhere Mr. Theisen is standing. And if we look at\\nthis, this looks like it's 2, 4, 6 feet high. So that's really the\\ninitial position of the ball when Mr. Theisen is\\nabout to let go of it. Then he lets go of\\nit, and the ball goes in this\\nparabolic trajectory. It increases, increases,\\nincreasing, increases. It looks like it hits a maximum\\npoint right around there, roughly. That looks like it's\\nat about 16 feet. And then it starts to go down. And right over\\nhere-- and this looks like it's about,\\nlet's see, 22, 24, 26 feet out-- it looks\\nlike it hit something. And considering that\\nsomething is 10 feet high, it's reasonable to assume\\nthat the thing that it hits is the goal. And especially\\nbecause the question states that he has deadly\\nthree-point precision, we can assume it's not\\ncrazy that he actually makes the goal. And so that's where\\nit goes into the net. And then the net forces\\nthe ball to go down at a much steeper trajectory. And this is exactly, of\\ncourse, 10 feet high, the height of the goal. Now let's see which of\\nthese interpretations are consistent with\\nthe interpretation that we just did. The ball is released\\nfrom Mr. Theisen's hand at a height of 6 feet. Well, that looks exactly right. When x is equal to 0,\\nthe ball is 6 feet. And not only is\\nthat right, but that is the significance of the\\ny-intercept of this function. The y-intercept\\nis the value of y, the height when x is equal to 0. So that is indeed\\nthe significance of the y-intercept. Let's look at\\nthese other things. Mr. Theisen is shooting the\\nbasketball from 26 feet away. Well, that's right. He's at x equals 0. The goal is at 26 feet away. But that's not the significance\\nof the y-intercept. That would be the\\nsignificance of where we saw this little point here\\nwhere the ball dropped down at a steeper angle. The rim of the basketball\\nhoop is 10 feet high. Once again, that's true. You can look at it. You can see it right over there. But that's not the significance\\nof the y-intercept. The maximum height that the\\nball reaches is 16 feet. Well, once again, that\\nis true, but that's the significance of this\\nmaximum point on the curve. That's not the significance\\nof the y-intercept. So we'll go with\\nthis first choice. \",\n",
       " '8.11.1': \"- So we have different definitions for d of t on the left and the right and let's say that d is\\ndistance and t is time, so this is giving us our\\ndistance as a function of time, on the left, it's equal to 3t plus one and you can see the graph\\nof how distance is changing as a function of time here is a line and just as a review from algebra, the rate of change of a line, we refer to as the slope of a\\nline and we can figure it out, we can figure out, well,\\nfor any change in time, what is our change in distance? And so in this situation, if we're going from time\\nequal one to time equal two, our change in time,\\ndelta t is equal to one and what is our change in distance? We go from distance is\\nequal to four meters, at time equals one, to distance in seven\\nmeters at time equal two and so our change in distance\\nhere is equal to three and if we wanna put our units, it's three meters for\\nevery one second in time and so our slope would be\\nour change in our vertical divided by our change in our horizontal, which would be change in\\nd, delta d over delta t, which is equal to three over one or we could just write that\\nas three meters per second and you might recognize this as a rate, if you're thinking about\\nyour change in distance over change in time,\\nthis rate right over here is going to be your speed. This is all a review of\\nwhat you've seen before and what's interesting about a line, or if we're talking\\nabout a linear function, is that your rate does\\nnot change at any point, the slope of this line\\nbetween any two points is always going to be three, but what's interesting about\\nthis function on the right is that is not true, our rate of change is constantly changing and we're going to study\\nthat in a lot more depth, when we get to differential calculus and really this video's a little bit of a foundational primer\\nfor that future state, where we learn about differential calculus and the thing to appreciate here is think about the instantaneous\\nrate of change someplace, so let's say right over there, if you ever think about\\nthe slope of a line, that just barely touches this graph, it might look something like that, the slope of a tangent line and then right over here, it looks like it's a little bit steeper and then over here, it looks\\nlike it's a little bit steeper, so it looks like your rate of change is increasing as t increases. As I mentioned, we will build the tools to later think about\\ninstantaneous rate of change, but what we can start to think about is an average rate of change, average rate of change, and the way that we think about\\nour average rate of change is we use the same tools, that\\nwe first learned in algebra, we think about slopes of secant lines, what is a secant line? Well, we talk about this in geometry, that a secant is something\\nthat intersects a curve in two points, so let's\\nsay that there's a line, that intersects at t equals\\nzero and t equals one and so let me draw that\\nline, I'll draw it in orange, so this right over here is a secant line and you could do the\\nslope of the secant line as the average rate of change from t equals zero to t equals one, well, what is that average\\nrate of change going to be? Well, the slope of our\\nsecant line is going to be our change in distance\\ndivided by our change in time, which is going to be equal to, well, our change in time is one second, one, I'll put the units here, one second and what is our change in distance? At t equals zero or d of zero is one and d of one is two, so our distance has\\nincreased by one meter, so we've gone one meter in one second or we could say that our\\naverage rate of change over that first second from t equals zero, t equals one is one meter per second, but let's think about what it is, if we're going from t equals two to t equals three. Well, once again, we can\\nlook at this secant line and we can figure out its slope, so the slope here,\\nwhich you could also use the average rate of change from t equals two to t equals three, as I already mentioned, the rate of change seems\\nto be constantly changing, but we can think about\\nthe average rate of change and so that's going to\\nbe our change in distance over our change in time, which is going to be equal\\nto when t is equal to two, our distance is equal to five, so one, two, three, four, five, so that's five right over there and when t is equal to three,\\nour distance is equal to 10, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,\\nso that is 10 right over there, so our change in time, that's\\npretty straightforward, we've just gone forward one\\nsecond, so that's one second and then our change in\\ndistance right over here, we go from five meters to\\n10 meters is five meters, so this is equal to five meters per second and so this makes it very clear, that our average rate\\nof change has changed from t equals zero, t equals one to t equals two to t equals three, our average rate of change is higher on this second interval,\\nthan on this first one and as you can imagine, something very interesting to think about is what if you were to take the slope of the secant line of\\ncloser and closer points? Well, then you would get closer and closer to approximating that\\nslope of the tangent line and that's actually what we\\nwill do when we get to calculus. \",\n",
       " '8.11.2': \"Over which interval does y\\nof x have an average rate of change of negative 4? So average rate of change,\\nif you think about it, you are literally just\\naveraging for example, in this bowl section\\nright over here. The slope is really,\\nreally steep. It gets less steep. It's a very negative slope,\\nit gets less negative. Less negative slope is 0 here. Then it gets positive, more\\npositive, and more positive, and more positive. But when you get to this\\npoint right over here, you see you got to\\nwhere you started from. One you could say the\\nnet change has been 0. And any interval over which\\nthe net change has been 0 also tells you that the average rate\\nof change is going to be 0. So you could view that\\nthe average rate of change is really the slope\\nof the line that connects the two endpoints\\nof your interval. So another way of asking\\nover which interval does y of x have an average\\nrate of change of negative 4 is, can you come\\nup with an interval where the slope between the\\nendpoints of the interval is negative 4? So let's see the\\nchoices they give us. This first interval is x is\\nbetween negative 1 and 1. So x is between negative 1. So this is x is negative 1. When x is equal to negative 1,\\ny of x is all the way over here. y of negative 1 is equal to 7. And then when x is equal to 1,\\nour graph is down over here. y of 1 is negative 1. So what is the slope\\nof the line that connects the endpoints\\nof those two points? So what is the\\nslope of this line? Because the slope of\\nthis line, the line that connects the endpoints\\nof my interval, that is going to be the\\naverage rate of change over this interval. And you see very clearly\\nthat the slope here, the rate of change of y with\\nrespect to x is negative 4. Every time we move one\\nahead in the x direction, we move down four\\nin the y direction. Move one ahead in\\nthe x direction, we move down four\\nin the y direction. So the average rate of\\nchange over this interval is negative 4. So we didn't have to even\\nlook at anything else, that one will work. \",\n",
       " '8.11.3': \"What is the average\\nrate of change of y of x over the\\ninterval negative 5 is less than x is\\nless than negative 2? So this is x is\\nequal to negative 5. When x is equal to negative\\n5, y of x is equal to 6. And when x is equal to negative\\n2, y of x is equal to 0. So to figure out the\\naverage rate of change, so the average rate\\nof change, of y of x, with respect--\\nand we can assume it's with respect to x-- let me\\nmake that a little bit neater-- this is going to\\nbe the change in y of x over that interval over the\\nchange of x of that interval. And the shorthand for change\\nis this triangle symbol, delta. Delta y-- I'll just write y. I could write delta y of x. It's delta y. Change in y over\\nour change in x. That's going to be our\\naverage rate of change over this interval. So how much did y change\\nover this interval? So y went from a 6 to a 0. So let's say that we\\ncan kind of view this as our endpoint right over here. So this is our end. This is our start. And we could have done\\nit the other way around. We would get a\\nconsistent result. But since this is\\nhigher up on the list, let's call this the start. And the x is a lower value. We'll call that our start. This is our end. So we start at 6. We end at 0. So our change in y is\\ngoing to be negative 6. We went down by 6\\nin the y direction. It's negative 6. You could say that's 0 minus 6. And our change in x, well,\\nwe are at negative 5, and we go up to negative 2. We increased by 3. So when we increased x by\\n3, we decreased y of x by 6. Or if we want to simplify\\nthis right over here, negative 6 over 3 is the\\nsame thing as negative 2. So our average\\nrate of change of y of x over the interval from\\nnegative 5 to negative 2 is negative 2. Every time, on\\naverage, x increased 1, y went down by negative 2. \",\n",
       " '8.12.1': \"Let T of T, so capital T of lowercase T denote the temperature capital T in Windhoek, Namibia measured in degrees Celsius when it's T lowercase T hours after midnight on a given day. The table below lists a few selected values of the function. Alright, when it's 6 hours after midnight our temperature is 19 degrees Celsius Nine hours after midnight or 9 a.m. 25 degrees Celsius. 13 hours after midnight, which is the same thing as 1 p.m. Our temperature is 31 degrees Celsius. When did the temperature increase faster? So this is between 6 & 9 a.m.. So 6 & 9 a.m.. 9 a.m.. and 1 p.m. So that's between these two points, or did the temperature increase at the same rate over both intervals? Well if we want to figure out the rate of increase- so let's see rate of temperature change temperature change Well this is going to be equal to, our change in temperature capital T, over our change in time. This triangle, that's the Greek letter Delta, represents change in. So change in temperature over change in time. So let's think about what this rate of temperature change is, between these different intervals. So between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.. So let me really see Change in temperature over change in time So what was our change in temperature? Our temperature went up, by 6 degrees Celsius. Let me just write it here 6 degrees Celsius. And what is our change in time? Our time went up by 3 hours, plus 3 hours. So you're going to have a change of 6 degrees Celsius, positive change of 6 degrees Celsius over a positive change, we've Gone 3 hours into the future, Over 3 hours we increased our temperature by 6 degrees or you could say it's an average rate of change of 6 divided by 3 is 2 degrees Celsius, per hour. Notice, I'm just keeping the unit's the same degrees Celsius per hour, so that's the rate of change between 6 a.m. And 9:00 a.m. Now let's ask ourselves the same question between 9:00 a.m.. and 1:00 p.m.. So our change in temperature over change in time What is our change in temperature? Well our temperature goes up from 25 to 31 degrees Celsius. That's another 6 degrees Celsius. But it's no longer 3 hours to go from 9 hours after minute to 13 hours after midnight We're now doing it over 4 hours. So Plus 4 hours. So 6 degrees Celsius over 4 hours and We actually don't even have to calculate you see that you've had you've had the same change But you've had to do it over more hours So this is a lower Rate of change the temperature is increasing slower here. It took it four hours to increase 6 degrees Celsius well over here it took it only 3 hours. So immediately you might recognize that this is going to be faster. If you increase 6 degrees Celsius over 3 hours that's faster than increasing 6 degrees Celsius Over 4 hours. But just to make the comparison a little bit clearer Let's actually just do the math here. 6 divided by 4 well that's going to be 1.5 1.5 degrees Celsius per hour. Here you can make the direct comparison. 2 degrees Celsius per hour is faster than 1.5 degrees Celsius per hour. So that's why we liked this choice up here \",\n",

It's actually quite large, so let me zoom out a little bit. And we can see that at time zero her height is seven hundred meters and then as time increases, as we move to the right her height is decreasing. And her height is decreasing at faster and faster rates as we move to the right so her- her- the rate of decline of her height is quite steep as we approach ten seconds after she jumps And then we can see all of a sudden, then we can see all of a sudden her rate of decline slows down She's still declining as -as we move forward in time, but she's declining at a slower rate. And so we can say she's declining at a --- or she is --- her height is changing at a less negative rate It's -It's quite a negative rate right over here --- seems roughly a fairly negative rate but then it becomes a less negative rate right over here her height is changing at a less negative rate and it makes sense that this is when she deploys the parachute, so after 10 seconds she deploys the parachute so she jumps at 0 seconds, 10 seconds she deploys the parachute. Alright so let's see what they're asking --- actually asking us. They say Complete the following sentence Between 3 seconds and 8 seconds after Teresa jumped, her height decreased, on average, by approximately blank meters per second. So between 3 seconds, and 8 seconds, so at 3 seconds --- so time is 3 right over there So, Let's see what H(3) is. what is her height at 3 seconds and I'm just looking\\nat a graph so I'm going to have to Ballpark it so at 3 seconds at 3 seconds\\nher height looks pretty close it's pretty close we just have to approximate\\nit so her height at the height after 3 seconds it looks like it's about halfway\\nbetween 600 and 700 so it looks like it's about 650 meters and then we care\\nbetween 3 seconds and 8 seconds so our height at 8 seconds let's look at that\\nat 8 seconds let's see this looks about halfway it looks about halfway between\\n350 between 350 and 400 so I'll say her height at 8 seconds actually since I'm\\napproximating it let me put a little squiggly equal sign here her height\\nafter 8 seconds looks like it's approximately 300 and looks\\napproximately 375 meters 375 meters so what is her average rate of change her\\nheight decreased on average by approximately so we what we want to do\\nis we forgot to figure out the average rate of change which you could view as\\nthe slope of the line that connects these two points the slope of this line\\nis going to be her average rate of change so let's think about that her\\naverage rate of change her change in height over the change in time for that\\ninterval well her change in height after at 8 seconds she is at let me write it\\nthis way her height at 8 seconds - her height at 3 seconds so this is going to\\nbe her change in height and the change in time is 8 seconds she finishes at 8\\nseconds - where she started or the interval that we care about starting at\\n3 seconds and so H of 8 we already said this is approximately 375 H of 3 this is\\n650 and then of course 8 minus 3 is going to be equal to 5\\nI just want emphasize this is just her average rate of change for approximate\\naverage rate of change over this interval as we as we go from 3 to 8\\nseconds our height goes from H of 3 to H of 8 so this is going to be let's see\\n375 - 650 let's see if it was 375 - 675 it would\\nbe negative 300 and so this is going to be but then we're not subtracting 675\\nwe're subtracting 650 so it's going to be 25 it's going to be 25 more so this\\nis going to be negative 275 over 5 let me make sure I did that math right let\\nme make sure I did that math right so it's 375 - 650 is\\nnegative 275 does that make sense let's see 275 plus 375 would be 2 650\\nyeah that is right all right so let's just figure out what this is so 5 I'll\\njust figure out what 5 goes into 275 and then we can remember the negative 5 goes\\ninto 27 5 times 5 times 5 is 25 subtract we get a to bring down to 5 5\\ngoes into 25 five times and then we're not going to have a remainder so this is\\ngoing to be equal to negative 55 negative 55 and the unit's our height is\\ngiven in meters so this part up here this is in meters up here meters per\\nsecond so her change in height or average change in height over or the\\naverage rate of change of height over this five seconds over this five seconds\\nis negative 55 meters per second one way to think about it the slope right over\\nhere the slope is equal to negative 55 now it might be tempting to just\\nwrite negative 55 right over here but let's just think about whether that\\nwould be right between 3 seconds and 8 seconds after Teresa jumped her height\\ndecreased on average by approximately negative 55 meters per second and\\ndecrease is important because they're already saying that it's decreased when\\nthis negative is telling us that we're decreasing we're decreasing at a rate of\\n55 meters per second our average rate of change is a decrease our average rate of\\nhigh a change of height over time is a decrease of 55 meters per second well\\nthe negative is already saying the decrease so we're not decreasing at a\\nnegative rate of change we would be decreasing at 55 meters per second so\\nlet me just write it 55 meters per second if they asked if they asked her\\nheight if we asked her height if we if they asked the average change of height\\naverage rate of change let me write this the average rate of change of change of\\nH over or let me say of H from 3 seconds 3 seconds\\nto 8 seconds well now this would be negative 55\\nmeters per second but when they're saying that her height decrease that's\\nre taking the negative into consideration they're saying it's\\ndefinitely decreasing that's what the negatives already telling us it's\\ndecreasing by a rate of 55 meters per second hopefully that makes some sense \",\n",
       " '8.13.1': \"Let's think about what\\nfunctions really do, and then we'll think about the idea of\\nan inverse of a function. So let's start with a pretty\\nstraightforward function. Let's say f of x is\\nequal to 2x plus 4. And so if I take f of 2, f of 2\\nis going to be equal to 2 times 2 plus 4, which is 4\\nplus 4, which is 8. I could take f of 3, which\\nis 2 times 3 plus 4, which is equal to 10. 6 plus 4. So let's think about it\\nin a little bit more of an abstract sense. So there's a set of things that\\nI can input into this function. You might already be\\nfamiliar with that notion. It's the domain. The set of all of the things\\nthat I can input into that function, that is the domain. And in that domain, 2 is\\nsitting there, you have 3 over there, pretty much you could\\ninput any real number into this function. So this is going to be all\\nreal, but we're making it a nice contained set here just\\nto help you visualize it. Now, when you apply the\\nfunction, let's think about it means to take f of 2. We're inputting a number, 2,\\nand then the function is outputting the number 8. It is mapping us from 2 to 8. So let's make another set here\\nof all of the possible values that my function can take on. And we can call that the range. There are more formal ways to\\ntalk about this, and there's a much more rigorous discussion\\nof this later on, especially in the linear algebra playlist,\\nbut this is all the different values I can take on. So if I take the number 2 from\\nour domain, I input it into the function, we're getting\\nmapped to the number 8. So let's let me draw that out. So we're going from 2 to\\nthe number 8 right there. And it's being done\\nby the function. The function is\\ndoing that mapping. That function is mapping\\nus from 2 to 8. This right here, that\\nis equal to f of 2. Same idea. You start with 3, 3 is being\\nmapped by the function to 10. It's creating an association. The function is mapping\\nus from 3 to 10. Now, this raises an\\ninteresting question. Is there a way to get back from\\n8 to the 2, or is there a way to go back from\\nthe 10 to the 3? Or is there some\\nother function? Is there some other function,\\nwe can call that the inverse of f, that'll take us back? Is there some other\\nfunction that'll take us from 10 back to 3? We'll call that the inverse\\nof f, and we'll use that as notation, and it'll take\\nus back from 10 to 3. Is there a way to do that? Will that same inverse of f,\\nwill it take us back from-- if we apply 8 to it-- will\\nthat take us back to 2? Now, all this seems very\\nabstract and difficult. What you'll find is it's\\nactually very easy to solve for this inverse of f, and I think\\nonce we solve for it, it'll make it clear what\\nI'm talking about. That the function takes you\\nfrom 2 to 8, the inverse will take us back from 8 to 2. So to think about that, let's\\njust define-- let's just say y is equal to f of x. So y is equal to f of x,\\nis equal to 2x plus 4. So I can write just y is equal\\nto 2x plus 4, and this once again, this is our function. You give me an x,\\nit'll give me a y. But we want to go the\\nother way around. We want to give you\\na y and get an x. So all we have to do is\\nsolve for x in terms of y. So let's do that. If we subtract 4 from both\\nsides of this equation-- let me switch colors-- if we subtract\\n4 from both sides of this equation, we get y minus 4 is\\nequal to 2x, and then if we divide both sides of this\\nequation by 2, we get y over 2 minus 2-- 4 divided by 2\\nis 2-- is equal to x. Or if we just want to write it\\nthat way, we can just swap the sides, we get x is equal to\\n1/2y-- same thing as y over 2-- minus 2. So what we have here is\\na function of y that gives us an x, which is\\nexactly what we wanted. We want a function of these\\nvalues that map back to an x. So we can call this-- we could\\nsay that this is equal to-- I'll do it in the same color--\\nthis is equal to f inverse as a function of y. Or let me just write it\\na little bit cleaner. We could say f inverse as a\\nfunction of y-- so we can have 10 or 8-- so now the range is\\nnow the domain for f inverse. f inverse as a function of y\\nis equal to 1/2y minus 2. So all we did is we started\\nwith our original function, y is equal to 2x plus 4, we\\nsolved for-- over here, we've solved for y in terms of x--\\nthen we just do a little bit of algebra, solve for x in terms\\nof y, and we say that that is our inverse as a function of y. Which is right over here. And then, if we, you know, you\\ncan say this is-- you could replace the y with an a, a b,\\nan x, whatever you want to do, so then we can just\\nrename the y as x. So if you put an x into this\\nfunction, you would get f inverse of x is equal\\nto 1/2x minus 2. So all you do, you solve for x,\\nand then you swap the y and the x, if you want to\\ndo it that way. That's the easiest way\\nto think about it. And one thing I want to point\\nout is what happens when you graph the function\\nand the inverse. So let me just do a\\nlittle quick and dirty graph right here. And then I'll do a bunch of\\nexamples of actually solving for inverses, but I really\\njust wanted to give you the general idea. Function takes you from the\\ndomain to the range, the inverse will take you from that\\npoint back to the original value, if it exists. So if I were to graph these--\\njust let me draw a little coordinate axis right here,\\ndraw a little bit of a coordinate axis right there. This first function, 2x plus 4,\\nits y intercept is going to be 1, 2, 3, 4, just like that, and\\nthen its slope will look like this. It has a slope of 2, so it will\\nlook something like-- its graph will look-- let me make it a\\nlittle bit neater than that-- it'll look something like that. That's what that\\nfunction looks like. What does this\\nfunction look like? What does the inverse function\\nlook like, as a function of x? Remember we solved for x,\\nand then we swapped the x and the y, essentially. We could say now that y is\\nequal to f inverse of x. So we have a y-intercept\\nof negative 2, 1, 2, and now the slope is 1/2. The slope looks like this. Let me see if I can draw it. The slope looks-- or the line\\nlooks something like that. And what's the\\nrelationship here? I mean, you know, these look\\nkind of related, it looks like they're reflected\\nabout something. It'll be a little bit more\\nclear what they're reflected about if we draw the\\nline y is equal to x. So the line y equals\\nx looks like that. I'll do it as a dotted line. And you could see, you have\\nthe function and its inverse, they're reflected about\\nthe line y is equal to x. And hopefully, that\\nmakes sense here. Because over here, on\\nthis line, let's take an easy example. Our function, when you take\\n0-- so f of 0 is equal to 4. Our function is mapping 0 to 4. The inverse function, if\\nyou take f inverse of 4, f inverse of 4 is equal to 0. Or the inverse function is\\nmapping us from 4 to 0. Which is exactly\\nwhat we expected. The function takes us from the\\nx to the y world, and then we swap it, we were swapping\\nthe x and the y. We would take the inverse. And that's why it's reflected\\naround y equals x. So this example that I just\\nshowed you right here, function takes you from 0 to 4-- maybe I\\nshould do that in the function color-- so the function takes\\nyou from 0 to 4, that's the function f of 0 is 4, you see\\nthat right there, so it goes from 0 to 4, and then\\nthe inverse takes us back from 4 to 0. So f inverse takes us\\nback from 4 to 0. You saw that right there. When you evaluate 4 here,\\n1/2 times 4 minus 2 is 0. The next couple of videos we'll\\ndo a bunch of examples so you really understand how to solve\\nthese and are able to do the exercises on our\\napplication for this. \",\n",
       " '8.13.2': 'You may by now be familiar with the notion of evaluating a function\\nwith a particular value, so for example,\\nif this table is our function definition, if someone were to say,\\n\"Well, what is f of -9?\" you could say, okay, if we input -9\\ninto our function, if x is -9, this table tell us\\nthat f of x is going to be equal to 5. You might already have experience\\nwith doing composite functions, where you say, f of f of -9 plus 1. So this is interesting,\\nit seems very daunting, but you say, well we know\\nwhat f of -9 is, this is going to be 5, so it\\'s going to be f of 5 plus 1. So this is going to be equal to f of 6, and if we look at our table,\\nf of 6 is equal to -7. So all of that is review so far, but what I want to now do is\\nstart evaluating the inverse of functions. This function f is invertable, because it\\'s a one-to-one mapping\\nbetween the xs and the f of xs. No two xs map to the same f of x,\\nso this is an invertable function. With that in mind,\\nlet\\'s see if we can evaluate something like f inverse of 8. What is that going to be? I encourage you to pause the video\\nand try to think about it. So f of x, just as a reminder\\nof what functions do, f of x is going to map from this domain,\\nfrom a value in its domain to a corresponding value in the range. So this is what f does,\\nthis is domain... and this right over here is the range. Now f inverse, if you pass it,\\nthe value and the range, it\\'ll map it back\\nto the corresponding value in the domain. But how do we think about it like this? Well, f inverse of 8,\\nthis is whatever maps to 8, so if this was 8, we\\'d have to say,\\nwell, what mapped to 8? We see here f of 9 is 8, so f inverse of 8\\nis going to be equal to 9. If it makes it easier,\\nwe could construct a table, where I could say x and f inverse of x, and what I\\'d do is swap\\nthese two columns. f of x goes from -9 to 5,\\nf inverse of x goes from 5 to -9. All I did was swap these two.\\nNow we\\'re mapping from this to that. So f inverse of x is going to map\\nfrom 7 to -7. Notice, instead of mapping\\nfrom this thing to that thing, we\\'re now going to map\\nfrom that thing to this thing. So f inverse is going to map\\nfrom 13 to 5. It\\'s going to map from -7 to 6. It\\'s going to map from 8 to 9, and it\\'s going to map from 12 to 11. Looks like I got all of them, yep. So all I did was swap these columns. The f inverse maps from this column\\nto that column. So I just swapped them out.\\nNow it becomes a little clearer. You see it right here, f inverse of 8,\\nif you input 8 into f inverse, you get 9. Now we can use that\\nto start doing fancier things. We can evaluate something like\\nf of f inverse of 7. f of f inverse of 7. What is this going to be? Let\\'s first evaluate f inverse of 7. f inverse of 7 maps from 7 to -7. So this is going to be f\\nof this stuff in here, f inverse of 7, you see,\\nis -7. And then to evaluate the function,\\nf of -7 is going to be 7. And that makes complete sense. We mapped from f inverse of 7\\nto -7 and evaluating the function of that,\\nwent back to 7. So let\\'s do one more of these\\njust to really feel comfortable with mapping back-and-forth\\nbetween these two sets, between applying the function\\nand the inverse of the function. Let\\'s evaluate f inverse\\nof f inverse of 13. f inverse of 13. What is that going to be? I encourage you to pause the video\\nand try to figure it out. What\\'s f inverse of 13? That\\'s, looking at this table right here,\\nf inverse goes from 13 to 5. You see it over here, f went from 5 to 13,\\nso f inverse is going to go from 13 to 5. So, f inverse of 13 is going to be 5, so this is the same thing\\nas f inverse of 5. And f inverse of 5? -9.\\nSo this is going to be equal to -9. Once again, f inverse goes\\nfrom 5 to -9. So at first when you start doing\\nthese functions and inverse of functions it looks a little confusing,\\nhey, I\\'m going back and forth, but you just have to remember a function maps from one set of numbers\\nto another set of numbers. The inverse of that function\\ngoes the other way. If the function goes from 9 to 8,\\nthe inverse is going to go from 8 to 9. So one way to think about it is,\\nyou just switch these columns. Hopefully, that clarifies\\nmore things than it confuses. ',\n",
       " '8.13.3': \"This right over here is our understanding inverses of functions\\nexercise on Khan Academy. It's a good exercise to make sure\\nyou understand inverses of functions. It's an interactive one\\nwhere we can move this line around and it tells us 'the graph of h(x)\\nis the green', so that's this dotted green line,\\n'the dashed line segment shown below'. So that's this. 'Drag the endpoints of the segment below\\nto graph h inverse of (x). There's a couple of ways to tackle it. Perhaps the simplest one\\nis we say, okay, look, h(x), what does h(x)\\nmap from and to? So h(x), this point\\nshows that h(x), if you input -8 into h of (x),\\nh of -8 is 1, so it's mapping from -8 to 1. Well, the inverse of that, then,\\nshould map from 1 to -8. So let's put that point on the graph,\\nand let's go on the other end. On the other end of h of x, we see that when you input 3 into h of x,\\nwhen x is equal to 3, h of x is equal to -4. So this point shows us\\nthat it's mapping from 3 to -4. So the inverse of that would map\\nfrom -4 to 3. If you input -4 it should output 3. Since we took\\nthe two end points of this line and found the inverse mapping of it, what I have just done here\\nis that I have graphed the inverse. Another way to think about the inverse is if you were to draw the line y = x, these things should be reflections\\naround the line y =x because one way to think about it is,\\nyou're swapping the xs for the ys. If you were to draw the line y = x, if you flipped it around,\\nthe line y = x, the green line, you would actually get the old line. This would flip over there\\nand this would flip over there. But either way, we're done.\\nWe have graphed h inverse of x. \",\n",
       " '8.13.4': \"So we have f of x is equal to\\nnegative x plus 4, and f of x is graphed right here on\\nour coordinate plane. Let's try to figure out\\nwhat the inverse of f is. And to figure out the inverse,\\nwhat I like to do is I set y, I set the variable y, equal to f\\nof x, or we could write that y is equal to negative x plus 4. Right now, we've solved\\nfor y in terms of x. To solve for the inverse,\\nwe do the opposite. We solve for x in terms of y. So let's subtract 4\\nfrom both sides. You get y minus 4 is\\nequal to negative x. And then to solve for x, we can\\nmultiply both sides of this equation times negative 1. And so you get negative\\ny plus 4 is equal to x. Or just because we're always\\nused to writing the dependent variable on the left-hand side,\\nwe could rewrite this as x is equal to negative y plus 4. Or another way to write it\\nis we could say that f inverse of y is equal\\nto negative y plus 4. So this is the inverse function\\nright here, and we've written it as a function of y, but we\\ncan just rename the y as x so it's a function of x. So let's do that. So if we just rename this y as\\nx, we get f inverse of x is equal to the negative x plus 4. These two functions\\nare identical. Here, we just used y as the\\nindependent variable, or as the input variable. Here we just use x, but they\\nare identical functions. Now, just out of interest,\\nlet's graph the inverse function and see how it\\nmight relate to this one right over here. So if you look at it,\\nit actually looks fairly identical. It's a negative x plus 4. It's the exact same function. So let's see, if we have-- the\\ny-intercept is 4, it's going to be the exact same thing. The function is\\nits own inverse. So if we were to graph it,\\nwe would put it right on top of this. And so, there's a couple of\\nways to think about it. In the first inverse function\\nvideo, I talked about how a function and their inverse--\\nthey are the reflection over the line y equals x. So where's the line\\ny equals x here? Well, line y equals\\nx looks like this. And negative x plus 4 is\\nactually perpendicular to y is equal to x, so when you reflect\\nit, you're just kind of flipping it over, but it's\\ngoing to be the same line. It is its own reflection. Now, let's make sure that\\nthat actually makes sense. When we're dealing with the\\nstandard function right there, if you input a 2,\\nit gets mapped to a 2. If you input a 4, it\\ngets mapped to 0. What happens if you\\ngo the other way? If you input a 2, well, 2\\ngets mapped to 2 either way, so that makes sense. For the regular function,\\n4 gets mapped to 0. For the inverse function,\\n0 gets mapped to 4. So it actually makes\\ncomplete sense. Let's think about\\nit another way. For the regular function-- let\\nme write it explicitly down. This might be obvious to\\nyou, but just in case it's not, it might be helpful. Let's pick f of 5. f of 5 is equal to negative 1. Or we could say, the function f\\nmaps us from 5 to negative 1. Now, what does f inverse do? What's f inverse of negative 1? f inverse of negative 1 is 5. Or we could say that f maps\\nus from negative 1 to 5. So once again, if you think\\nabout kind of the sets, they're our domains and our ranges. So let's say that this is\\nthe domain of f, this is the range of f. f will take us from\\nto negative 1. That's what the\\nfunction f does. And we see that f inverse takes\\nus back from negative 1 to 5. f inverse takes us back\\nfrom negative 1 to 5, just like it's supposed to do. Let's do one more of these. So here I have g of x is equal\\nto negative 2x minus 1. So just like the last problem,\\nI like to set y equal to this. So we say y is equal to g\\nof x, which is equal to negative 2x minus 1. Now we just solve for x. y plus 1 is equal\\nto negative 2x. Just added 1 to both sides. Now we can divide both sides of\\nthis equation by negative 2, and so you get negative y over\\n2 minus 1/2 is equal to x, or we could write x is equal to\\nnegative y over 2 minus 1/2, or we could write f inverse as a\\nfunction of y is equal to negative y over 2 minus 1/2, or\\nwe can just rename y as x. And we could say that f inverse\\nof-- oh, let me careful here. That shouldn't be an f. The original function was\\ng , so let me be clear. That is g inverse of y is equal\\nto negative y over 2 minus 1/2 because we started with a\\ng of x, not an f of x. Make sure we get our\\nnotation right. Or we could just rename the y\\nand say g inverse of x is equal to negative x over 2 minus 1/2. Now, let's graph it. Its y-intercept\\nis negative 1/2. It's right over there. And it has a slope\\nof negative 1/2. Let's see, if we start at\\nnegative 1/2, if we move over to 1 in the positive direction,\\nit will go down half. If we move over 1 again, it\\nwill go down half again. If we move back-- so\\nit'll go like that. So the line, I'll try my\\nbest to draw it, will look something like that. It'll just keep going, so it'll\\nlook something like that, and it'll keep going in\\nboth directions. And now let's see if this\\nreally is a reflection over y equals x. y equals x looks\\nlike that, and you can see they are a reflection. If you reflect this guy, if you\\nreflect this blue line, it becomes this orange line. But the general idea, you\\nliterally just-- a function is originally expressed, is\\nsolved for y in terms of x. You just do some algebra. Solve for x in terms of y, and\\nthat's essentially your inverse function as a function of y,\\nbut then you can rename it as a function of x. \",\n",
       " '9.1.1': \"What I want to do in this\\nvideo is familiarize ourselves with the notion of a sequence. And all a sequence is is\\nan ordered list of numbers. So for example, I could\\nhave a finite sequence-- that means I don't have an\\ninfinite number of numbers in it-- where, let's say, I\\nstart at 1 and I keep adding 3. So 1 plus 3 is 4. 4 plus 3 is 7. 7 plus 3 is 10. And let's say I only have these\\nfour terms right over here. So this one we would\\ncall a finite sequence. I could also have an\\ninfinite sequence. So an example of an\\ninfinite sequence-- let's say we start at\\n3, and we keep adding 4. So we go to 3, to 7, to 11, 15. And you don't always have\\nto add the same thing. We'll explore fancier sequences. The sequences where you\\nkeep adding the same amount, we call these\\narithmetic sequences, which we will also\\nexplore in more detail. But to show that\\nthis is infinite, to show that we keep this\\npattern going on and on and on, I'll put three dots. This just means we're going to\\nkeep going on and on and on. So we could call this\\nan infinite sequence. Now, there's a bunch\\nof different notations that seem fancy for\\ndenoting sequences. But this is all they refer to. But I want to make us\\ncomfortable with how we can denote sequences and\\nalso how we can define them. We could say that\\nthis right over here is the sequence a sub k\\nfor k is going from 1 to 4, is equal to this\\nright over here. So when we look\\nat it this way, we can look at each of these as\\nthe terms in the sequence. And this right over here\\nwould be the first term. We would call that a sub 1. This right over here\\nwould be the second term. We'd call it a sub 2. I think you get the\\npicture-- a sub 3. This right over here is a sub 4. So this just says, all of the\\na sub k's from k equals 1, from our first term, all\\nthe way to the fourth term. Now, I could also define it\\nby not explicitly writing the sequence like this. I could essentially do\\nit defining our sequence as explicitly using kind of a\\nfunction notation or something close to function notation. So the same exact\\nsequence, I could define it as a sub k from k equals 1 to\\n4, with-- instead of explicitly writing the numbers\\nhere, I could say a sub k is equal to some function of k. So let's see what happens. When k is 1, we get 1. When k is 2, we get 4. When k is 3, we get 7. So let's see. When k is 3, we added 3 twice. Let me make it clear. So this was a plus 3. This right over\\nhere was a plus 3. This right over\\nhere is a plus 3. So whatever k is,\\nwe started at 1. And we added 3 one less\\nthan the k term times. So we could say that this\\nis going to be equal to 1 plus k minus 1\\ntimes 3, or maybe I should write 3 times k\\nminus 1-- same thing. And you can verify\\nthat this works. If k is equal to 1, you're\\ngoing to get 1 minus 1 is 0. And so a sub 1 is going to be 1. If k is equal to 2, you're going\\nto have 1 plus 3, which is 4. If k is equal to 3, you\\nget 3 times 2 plus 1 is 7. So it works out. So this is one way to explicitly\\ndefine our sequence with kind of this function notation. I want to make it clear--\\nI have essentially defined a function here. If I wanted a more\\ntraditional function notation, I could have written\\na of k, where k is the term that\\nI care about. a of k is equal to 1\\nplus 3 times k minus 1. This is essentially\\na function, where an allowable input,\\nthe domain, is restricted to positive integers. Now, how would I denote this\\nbusiness right over here? Well, I could say that\\nthis is equal to-- and people tend to use a. But I could use the notation\\nb sub k or anything else. But I'll do a again-- a sub k. And here, we're going\\nfrom our first term-- so this is a sub 1,\\nthis is a sub 2-- all the way to infinity. Or we could define it-- if we\\nwanted to define it explicitly as a function-- we could write\\nthis sequence as a sub k, where k starts at the first\\nterm and goes to infinity, with a sub k is equaling--\\nso we're starting at 3. And we are adding\\n4 one less time. For the second term,\\nwe added 4 once. For the third term,\\nwe add 4 twice. For the fourth term,\\nwe add 4 three times. So we're adding 4 one less\\nthan the term that we're at. So it's going to be\\nplus 4 times k minus 1. So this is another\\nway of defining this infinite sequence. Now, in both of these\\ncases, I defined it as an explicit function. So this right over\\nhere is explicit. That's not an attractive color. Let me write this in. This is an explicit function. And so you might\\nsay, well, what's another way of defining\\nthese functions? Well, we can also define\\nit, especially something like an arithmetic sequence, we\\ncan also define it recursively. And I want to be clear-- not\\nevery sequence can be defined as either an explicit\\nfunction like this, or as a recursive function. But many can,\\nincluding this, which is an arithmetic\\nsequence, where we keep adding the same\\nquantity over and over again. So how would we do that? Well, we could also--\\nanother way of defining this first sequence,\\nwe could say a sub k, starting at k equals\\n1 and going to 4 with. And when you define a\\nsequence recursively, you want to define what your\\nfirst term is, with a sub 1 equaling 1. You can define every other term\\nin terms of the term before it. And so then we\\ncould write a sub k is equal to the previous term. So this is a sub k minus 1. So a given term is equal\\nto the previous term. Let me make it clear-- this is\\nthe previous term, plus-- in this case, we're\\nadding 3 every time. Now, how does this make sense? Well, we're defining\\nwhat a sub 1 is. And if someone says, well,\\nwhat happens when k equals 2? Well, they're saying, well, it's\\ngoing to be a sub 2 minus 1. So it's going to\\nbe a sub 1 plus 3. Well, we know a sub 1 is 1. So it's going to be\\n1 plus 3, which is 4. Well, what about a sub 3? Well, it's going to be\\na sub 2 plus 3. a sub 2, we just calculated as 4. You add 3. It's going to be 7. This is essentially\\nwhat we mentally did when I first wrote out the\\nsequence, when I said, hey, I'm just going to start with 1. And I'm just going to add 3\\nfor every successive term. So how would we do this one? Well, once again, we could\\nwrite this as a sub k. Starting at k, the\\nfirst term, going to infinity with-- our\\nfirst term, a sub 1, is going to be 3, now. And every successive\\nterm, a sub k, is going to be the previous\\nterm, a sub k minus 1, plus 4. And once again, you start at 3. And then if you want\\nthe second term, it's going to be the\\nfirst term plus 4. It's going to be 3 plus 4. You get to 7. And you keep adding 4. So both of these,\\nthis right over here is a recursive definition. We started with\\nkind of a base case. And then every term is\\ndefined in terms of the term before it or in terms\\nof the function itself, but the function for\\na different term. \",\n",
       " '9.1.2': \"What I want to do in this\\nvideo is familiarize ourselves with a very common\\nclass of sequences. And this is\\narithmetic sequences. And they are usually\\npretty easy to spot. They are sequences where each\\nterm is a fixed number larger than the term before it. So my goal here is to figure\\nout which of these sequences are arithmetic sequences. And then just so that\\nwe have some practice with some of the\\nsequence notation, I want to define them\\neither as explicit functions of the term you're looking for,\\nthe index you're looking at, or as recursive definitions. So first, given that\\nan arithmetic sequence is one where each successive\\nterm is a fixed amount larger than the previous one, which of\\nthese are arithmetic sequences? Well let's look at this\\nfirst one right over here. To go from negative 5 to\\nnegative 3, we had to add 2. Then to go from negative 3 to\\nnegative 1, you have to add 2. Then to go from negative\\n1 to 1, you had to add 2. So this is clearly an\\narithmetic sequence. We're adding the same\\namount every time. And there are several ways that\\nwe could define the sequence. We could say it's a sub n. And you don't always\\nhave to use k. This time I'll use n\\nto denote our index. From n equals 1 to infinity\\nwith-- and there's two ways we could define it. We could either\\ndefine it explicitly, or we could define\\nit recursively. So if we wanted to\\ndefine it explicitly, we could write a sub n is equal\\nto whatever the first term is. In this case, our first\\nterm is negative 5. It's equal to negative\\n5 plus-- we're going to add 2 one less\\ntimes than the term we're at. So for the second\\nterm, we add 2 once. For the third term,\\nwe add 2 twice. For the fourth term,\\nfrom our base term, we added 2 three times. So we're going to add 2. We're going to add positive\\n2 one less than the index that we're looking\\nat-- n minus 1 times. So this is an\\nexplicit definition of this arithmetic sequence. If I wanted to write\\nit recursively, I could say a sub 1 is\\nequal to negative 5. And then each successive term,\\nfor a sub 2 and greater-- so I could say a sub n is equal\\nto a sub n minus 1 plus 3. Each term is equal to the\\nprevious term-- oh, not 3-- plus 2. So this is for n is\\ngreater than or equal to 2. So either of these\\nare completely legitimate ways of defining\\nthe arithmetic sequence that we have here. We can either define\\nit explicitly, or we could define\\nit recursively. Now let's look at this sequence. Is this one arithmetic? Well, we're going from 100. We add 7. 107 to 114, we're adding 7. 114 to 121, we are adding 7. So this is indeed an\\narithmetic sequence. So just to be\\nclear, this is one, and this is one right over here. And we could write that this\\nis the sequence a sub n, n going from 1 to infinity\\nof-- and we could just say a sub n, if we want\\nto define it explicitly, is equal to 100 plus\\nwe're adding 7 every time. And then each term-- the\\nsecond term we added 7 once. Third term-- we add 7 twice. So for the nth term, we're\\ngoing to add 7 n minus 1 times. So this is an explicit\\ndefinition of it, but we could also\\ndo it recursively. So just to be clear, this is\\none definition where we write it like this, or we\\ncould write a sub n, from n equals 1 to infinity. And in either case\\nI should write with. And if I want to\\ndefine it recursively, I could say a sub\\n1 is equal to 100. And then, for anything larger\\nthan 1, for any index above 1, a sub n is equal to the\\nprevious term plus 7. And so we're done. This is another\\nway of defining it. So in general, if you\\nwanted a generalizable way to spot or define an\\narithmetic sequence, you could say an\\narithmetic sequence is going to be of the form\\na sub n-- if we're talking about an infinite one--\\nfrom n equals 1 to infinity. If you want to\\ndefine it explicitly, you could say a sub n is\\nequal to some constant, which would essentially\\nthe first term. It would be some\\nconstant plus some number that your incrementing--\\nor I guess this could be a negative\\nnumber, or decrementing by-- times n minus 1. So this is one way to define\\nan arithmetic sequence. In this case, d was 2. In this case, d is 7. That's how much you're\\nadding by each time. And in this case, k is negative\\n5, and in this case, k is 100. The other way, if you\\nwanted to the right the recursive way of defining an\\narithmetic sequence generally, you could say a sub\\n1 is equal to k, and then a sub n is\\nequal to a sub n minus 1. A given term is equal\\nto the previous term plus d for n greater\\nthan or equal to 2. So once again, this is explicit. This is the recursive\\nway of defining it. And we would just\\nwrite with there. Now the last question I have\\nis is this one right over here an arithmetic sequence? Well, let's check it out. We start at 1. Then we add 2. Then we add 3. So this is an immediate\\ngiveaway that this is not an arithmetic sequence. Now we are adding 4. We're adding a different\\namount every time. So this, first of all,\\nthis is not arithmetic. This is not an\\narithmetic sequence. But how could we define\\nthis, since we're trying to define our sequences? Let's say we wanted to\\ndefine it recursively. So we could say, this is\\nequal to a sub n, where n is starting at 1 and\\nit's going to infinity, with-- we'll say our base\\ncase-- a sub 1 is equal to 1. And then for n is 2\\nor greater, a sub n is going to be equal to what? So a sub 2 is the previous\\nterm plus 2. a sub 3 is the previous\\nterm plus 3. a sub 4 is the previous term plus 4. So it's going to be the\\nprevious term plus whatever your index is. So this looks close,\\nbut notice here we're changing the amount\\nthat we're adding based on what our index is. We're adding the amount of\\nindex to the previous term. And so this is for n is\\ngreater than or equal to 2. Well for an arithmetic\\nsequence, we're adding the same\\namount regardless of what our index is. Here we're adding\\nthe index itself. So this one is not\\narithmetic, but it's an interesting\\nsequence nonetheless. \",\n",
       " '9.1.3': \"- [Voiceover] We're told\\nthe first four terms of an arithmetic sequence are given. So it goes from negative\\neight to negative 14 to negative 20 to negative 26. What is the fifth term in the sequence? So we just need to\\nfigure out the next term. Well, in arithmetic sequence, each successive term is\\nseparated by the same amount. So when we go from negative\\neight to negative 14, we went down by six and\\nthen we go down by six again to go to negative 20 and\\nthen we go down by six again to go to negative 26, and\\nso we're gonna go down by six again to get to negative 32. Negative 32. Let's do a couple more of these. The first five terms of\\nthe sequence are given. What is the sixth term? Let's see, to go from two to negative one, you subtracted three. Two minus three is negative one. Negative one minus three is negative four. Negative four minus\\nthree is negative seven. Negative seven minus three is negative 10. And so negative 10 minus\\nthree is negative 13. So hopefully that gives\\nyou the hang of things. \",\n",
       " '9.1.4': \"- [Voiceover] All right, we're told that the\\narithmetic sequence a-sub-i is defined by the formula where\\nthe ith term in the sequence is going to be 4 plus 3 times i minus 1. What is a-sub-20? And so a-sub-20 is the\\n20th term in the sequence and I encourage you to pause the video and figure out what is the 20th term? Well, we can just think\\nabout it like this. A-sub-20, we just use this\\ndefinition of the ith term. Everywhere we see an i,\\nwe would put a 20 in, so it's going to be 4 plus 3 times 20 minus 1, so once again, just to be clear, a-sub-20, where instead of a-sub-i,\\nwherever we saw an i, we put a 20, and now we can just compute\\nwhat this is going to be equal to. This is going to be equal to 4 plus 3 times 20 minus 1 is 19. 3 times 19, let's see, 3 times 19 is 57, right? It's 30 plus 27, yep. This is 57, and 4 plus 57 is equal to 61, so the 20th term in\\nthis arithmetic sequence is going to be 61. Let's do another one of these. And here, they've told us\\nthe arithmetic sequence a-sub-i is defined by the formula a-sub-1, they gave us the first term, and they say, every other term, so a-sub-i, they're defining\\nit in terms of the previous terms, so a-sub-i is going\\nto be a-sub-i minus 1 minus 2, so this is actually a\\nrecursive definition of our arithmetic sequence. Let's see what we can make of this, so a-sub-5, a-sub-5 is going to be equal to, we'll use this second line right here, a-sub-5 is going to be equal to a-sub-4 minus 2. Well, we don't know what\\na-sub-4 is just yet, so let's try to figure that out. So we could say that a-sub-4 is equal to, well if we use the second line again, it's going to be a-sub-3, minus 2. We still don't know what a-sub-3 is. I'll keep switching colors\\n'cause it looks nice. A-sub-3 is going to be equal to a-sub-3 minus 1, so a-sub-2 minus 2. We still don't know what a-sub-2 is, and so, we could write, a-sub-2 is equal to a-sub-2 minus 1, so that's a-sub-1 minus 2. Now, luckily we know what a-sub-1 is. A-sub-1 is negative 7. A-sub-1 is negative 7, so if this is negative 7, then a-sub-2 is negative 7 minus 2, which is equal to negative 9. Well that starts helping us out because if a-sub-2 is negative 9, if this is negative 9, then a-sub-3 is negative 9 minus 2, which is equal to negative 11. Well now that we know that\\na-sub-3 is negative 11, so this is negative 11, we could figure out a-sub-4 is negative 11 minus 2, which is equal to negative 13. And we're almost there. We know a-sub-4, the fourth term in this\\narithmetic sequence is negative 13, so, we can now, so if this is negative 13, a-sub-5 is going to be a-sub-4, which is negative 13 minus 2, which is equal to negative 15, so the fifth term in the sequence is negative 15. And we're all done. \",\n",
       " '9.1.5': \"- [Instructor] We are\\ntold b of one is equal to negative seven, and b of n is equal to b of n minus one plus\\n12, and they're asking us to find the fourth term in the sequence. So what we have up here, which you could use a function definition, it's really defining\\nthe terms of a sequence. Especially if are to input\\nwhole numbers in here, it's the index on your sequence. What we really wanna do\\nis, we wanna figure out what is b of four going to be equal to? Well if we just blindly apply this, we would say all right b of four, so be of n, is equal to\\nb of n minus one plus 12, so it's gonna be b of\\nfour minus one plus 12. Well four minus one is just three, so it's going to be equal\\nto b of three plus 12. All I did is said okay, well\\nwe're not trying to figure out, or we're not immediately\\ntrying to figure out what b of one is. We're trying to figure\\nout what b of four is, so n is equal to four, so b\\nof four is going to be equal to b of four minus one,\\nor b of three, plus 12. To evaluate this, we have to\\nfigure out what b of three is, so let's write that down. That's what's fun about\\na recursive definition. You have to keep recursing\\nbackwards, so b of three. Well if n is three, that's\\ngoing to be equal to b of, now n minus one is two, b of two plus 12. We don't know what b of two\\nis, so let's keep going. We need to figure out b of two. If we use the same definition,\\nb of two is going to be equal to b of two minus one plus\\n12, so b of two minus one. That's b of one plus 12, but\\nwe don't know what b of one is, so let's figure that out. B of one is equal to, well\\nhere we can finally use this top clause, so b of one\\nis equal to negative seven. Now we can go and fill everything back in. If b of one is equal to negative\\nseven, then we know that this right over here is negative seven, and now we can figure out\\nthat b of two is equal to negative seven plus 12\\nwhich is equal to five. If b of two is equal to\\nfive, well then this is equal to five right over here,\\nand then now we know that b of three is equal to five plus 12 which is equal to 17. If we know that b of three is equal to 17, then we're ready to calculate\\nwhat b of four is going to be. B of four is now, it's b of three, which we figured out was 17 plus 12 which is equal to 29, and we are done. \",\n",
       " '9.2.1': \"- [Voiceover] g is a function that describes an arithmetic sequence. Here are the first few\\nterms of the sequence. So let's say the first term is four, second term is 3 4/5, third term is 3 3/5, fourth term is 3 2/5. Find the values of the\\nmissing parameters A and B in the following recursive\\ndefinition of the sequence. So they say the nth term is going to be equal to A if n is equal to one and it's going to be\\nequal to g of n minus one plus B if n is greater than one. And so I encourage you to pause this video and see if you could figure out what A and B are going to be. Well, the first one to figure out, A is actually pretty straightforward. If n is equal to one, if n is equal to one, the first term when n equals one is four. So A is equal to four. So we could write this as g of n is equal to four if n is equal to one. And now let's think about the second line. The second line is interesting. It's saying it's going to be\\nequal to the previous term, g of n minus one. This means the n minus oneth term, plus B, will give you the nth term. Let's just think about what's happening with this arithmetic sequence. When I go from the first\\nterm to the second term, what have I done? Looks like I have subtracted 1/5, so minus 1/5, and then it's an arithmetic sequence so I should subtract or add\\nthe same amount to every time, and I am, I'm subtracting 1/5, and so I am subtracting 1/5. And so one way to think about it, if we were to go the other way, we could say, for example, that g of four is equal to g of three minus 1/5, minus 1/5. You see that right over here. g of three is this. You subtract 1/5, you get g of four. You see that right over there and of course I could have written this like g of four is equal to g of four minus one minus 1/5. So if you look at this way, you could see that if I'm\\ntrying to find the nth term, it's gonna be the n minus oneth term plus negative 1/5, so B is negative 1/5. Once again, if I'm trying\\nto find the fourth term, if n is equal to four, I'm not gonna use this first case 'cause this has to be for n equals one, so if n equals four, I\\nwould use the second case, so then it would be g of four minus one, it would be g of three minus 1/5. And so we could say g of n is equal to g of n minus one, so the term right before that minus 1/5 if n is greater than one. But for the sake of this problem, we see that A is equal to four and B is equal to negative 1/5. \",\n",
       " '9.2.2': 'So we see here in this table, that for given \"n\\'s\", when \"n\" is one, \"f\" of \"n\" is 12, when\\n\"n\" is 2, \"f\" of \"n\" is 5, and when \"n\" is three, \"f\"\\nof \"n\" is negative two, when \"n\" is four, \"f\"\\nof \"n\" is negative nine. And so one way to think about it is this function \"f\" is defining a sequence where the first term\\nof this sequence is 12. The second term of this sequence is five. The third term of this\\nsequence is negative two. The fourth term of the\\nsequence is negative nine. And it goes on, and on, and on. And you might notice that\\nit\\'s a arithmetic sequence. We start with a 12, and\\nthen the next term... What have we done? We\\'ve subtracted seven. Now to go from the second\\nto the third term... What do we do? We subtract seven. So each term is seven less\\nthan the term before it. Now with that out of the\\nway, see if you can define this function of \"n.\" If you\\ncan define it explicitly. So figure out a function definition. So I want to figure out\\n\"f\" of \"n\" is equal. I want you to figure out\\nwhat this needs to be so that if you input \"n\" here, it gives you the appropriate \"f\" of \"n.\" So let\\'s think about it a little bit. It\\'s going to be, we could think\\nof it as we\\'re starting at, The first term is going to be 12. But then, we are going to subtract seven. And what are we going to subtract seven? How many times are we\\ngoing to subtract seven? So for the first term, we\\nsubtract seven zero times. And so we just get 12. For the second term,\\nwe subtract seven once. For the third term, we subtract\\nseven twice. One, two times. For the fourth term, we\\nsubtract seven three times. So it looks like whatever term we\\'re on, we\\'re subtracting seven \"n\" minus one, we\\'re subtracting seven\\nwhatever term we\\'re on, that term minus one time. So it\\'s \"n\" minus one times. And let\\'s see if this actually works out. So \"f\" of one is going to\\nbe 12 minus seven times one minus one, that\\'s a zero. So that\\'s all just going to be 12. \"f\" of two is going to be 12 minus seven times two minus one. So it\\'s going to be 12\\nminus seven times one. We\\'re just going to subtract seven once, which is exactly the case. We started at 12, we subtract seven once. \"f\" of three, you can keep testing this. 12 minus, and we should have\\nto subtract seven twice. And we see three minus one, is two times. So we\\'re going to\\nsubtract seven two times. So this looks right on. We\\'ve defined the function explicitly. We\\'ve defined \"f\" explicitly\\nfor this sequence. Let\\'s do another example, here. So in this case, we have some function definitions already here. So you have your sequence, it\\'s kind of viewed in this table. You could view it as the\\nfirst term is negative 100. The next term is negative\\n50, next term is zero, next term is 50. And it\\'s very clear that this is also an arithmetic sequence. We\\'re starting at negative\\n100, and then, we\\'re adding 50. And then we\\'re adding 50, and then we are adding 50. So each term is 50 more\\nthan the term before it. And what I want you to\\ndo is pause the video, and think about which\\nof these definitions of the function \"f\" are correct. And it might be more than one. Alright, so let\\'s think about it. So this definition right over here, one way to think about it is by saying I\\'m going to start at negative 100. And I\\'m going to add\\n50, \"n\" minus one times. Does this make sense? Well, for the first term,\\nif we start at negative 100, we don\\'t want to add 50 at all, we want to add 50 zero\\ntimes, and it works out. Because one minus one is going to be zero. So it checks out for \"n\" equals one. Let\\'s see, for \"n\" equals two,\\nyou start at negative 100, I want to add 50 once. So this should be a one. Two minus one, yup, it\\'s a one! We\\'re adding 50. Whatever this number is, whatever \"n\" is, we\\'re adding 50 one less that number of times. So for here, we\\'re adding 50 twice. When \"n\" is four, we\\'re\\nadding 50 three times. And this one checks out. When \"n\" is four, we\\'re adding 50, four minus one, three times. Negative 100, plus 50 times three. We\\'re adding 50 three times, adding 50 one, two, three times. Well that gives you\\n50. So I like this one. Now let\\'s see about this one over here. Negative 150 plus 50 \"n.\" Alright, that\\'s one way\\nof saying, so let\\'s see If \"n\" is equal to one,\\nit\\'s going to be negative... Actually, let me draw\\na table for this one. So if we have \"n\" and we have \"f\" of \"n.\" This is going to be for this\\ncharacter right over here. So if \"n\" is one, it\\'s going\\nto negative 150, plus 50. Which is negative 100,\\nyup that checks out. When \"n\" is two, we get negative 150, plus 50 times two, which is going to be... This is 100, and there\\'s negative 150, this is going to be negative 50. When \"n\" is three, and\\nthat checks out, of course. When \"n\" is three, you get negative 150, plus 50, times three,\\nwhich is equal to zero. This checks out. This one over here is going to work. And you might say, \"Well, hey, these formulas look different.\" Well you can algebraically manipulate them to see that they\\'re the exact same thing. If you were to take this first one, it\\'s negative 100, plus,\\nlet\\'s distribute this 50, plus 50 \"n\", plus 50 \"n\", minus 50. Well, negative 100, minus\\n50, that\\'s negative 150. And then you have plus 50 \"n.\" So these are algebraically the exact same definition for our function. Now what about this one here? Negative 100 plus 50\\n\"n\", does this one work? Let\\'s see, when \"n\" is equal to one, this would be negative 100\\nplus 50, which is negative 50. Well no, this doesn\\'t work. We need to get a negative 100 here. So this one is not, not correct. ',\n",
       " '9.2.3': \"- [Instructor] We are\\nasked what is the value of the 100th term in this sequence, and the first term is 15, then nine, then three, then negative three. So let's write it like this in a table. So if we have the term, just so we have things straight, and then we have the value, and then we have the value of the term. I'll do a nice little table here. So our first term we saw is 15. Our second term is nine. Our third term is three. I'm just really copying this down, but I'm making sure we associate\\nit with the right term. And then our fourth term, our fourth term is negative three. And they wanna ask, they want us to figure\\nout what the 100th term of this sequence is going to be. So let's see what's happening here, if we can discern some type of pattern. So we went from the first\\nterm to the second term, what happened? 15 to nine, looks like\\nwe went down by six. It's always good to\\nthink about just how much the numbers changed by. That's always the\\nsimplest type of pattern. So we went down by six, we subtracted six. Then to go from nine to three, well we subtracted six again. We subtracted six again. And then to go from\\nthree to negative three, well we, we subtracted six again. We subtracted six again. So it looks like every term, you subtract six. So the second term is going to be six less than the first term. The third term is going to be 12 minus from the first term, or six subtracted twice. So in the third term, you subtract a six twice. In the fourth term, you subtract six three times. So whatever term you're looking at, you subtract six one less\\nthan that many times. Let me write this down just so, notice when your first term, you have 15 and you don't\\nsubtract six at all, or you could say you\\nsubtract six zero times. So you could say this is 15 minus six times or let me\\nwrite it better this way, minus zero times six. That's what that first\\nterm is right there. What's the second term? This is 15, it's just we just subtracted six once, or you could say minus one times six. Or you could say plus\\none times negative six, either way, we're\\nsubtracting the six once. Now what's happening here? This is 15, this is 15 minus two times negative six, or sorry minus two times six, minus two times six. We're subtracting a six twice. What's the fourth term? This is 15 minus, we're subtracting the six\\nthree times from the 15, so minus three times six. So if you see the pattern here, when our term, when we\\nhave our fourth term, we have the term minus one right there, the fourth term we have a three, the third term we have a two, the second term we have a one. So if we had the nth term, if we just had the nth term here, what's this going to be? It's going to be 15 minus, you see it's going to\\nbe n minus one right here, right when n is four,\\nn minus one is three. When n is three, n minus one is two. When n is two, n minus one is one. When n is one, n minus one is zero. So we're going to have, this term right here is n minus one, so minus n minus one times six. So if you wanna figure out the\\n100th term of this sequence, I didn't even have to write\\nit in this general term, you could just look at this pattern. It's going to be, and I'll do it in pink, the 100th term in our sequence, I'll continue our table\\ndown, is gonna be what? It's going to be 15 minus 100 minus one, which is 99, times six, right? I just followed the pattern. One, you had a zero here,\\ntwo, you had a one here, three, you had a two here, 100, you're gonna have a 99 here. So let's just calculate what this is. What's 99 times six? So 99 times six, actually you could do this in your head. You could say that's going to be six less than 100 times six, which is 600, and six less is 594. But if you didn't wanna do it that way, you just do it the old-fashioned way. Six times nine is 54, carry the five. Nine times six or six times nine is 54. 54 plus five is 594. So this right here is 594, and then to figure out what 15, so we wanna figure out, we wanna figure out what 15 minus 594 is, and this can sometimes be confusing, but the way I always\\nprocess this in my head is I say that this is the exact same thing as the negative of 594 minus 15. And if you don't believe me, distribute out this negative sign. Negative one times 594 is negative 594, negative one times\\nnegative 15 is positive 15. So these two statements are equivalent. This is much easier for\\nmy brain to understand. So what's 594 minus 15? You should do it, we\\ncould do this in our head. 594 minus 14 would be 580, and then 580 minus one more would be 579. So that right there is 579, and then we have this negative\\nsign sitting out there. So our the 100th term in our sequence will be negative 579. \",\n",
       " '9.2.4': \"- So I have a function here, h of n, and let's say that it explicitly defines the terms of a sequence. Let me make a little... Let me make a quick table here. We have n, and then we have h of n. When n is equal to one,\\nh of n is negative 31, minus seven times one minus one, which is going to be... This is just going to be zero, so it's going to be negative 31. When n is equal to two,\\nit's going to be negative 31 minus seven times two minus one, so two minus one. This is just going to be one, so it's negative 31 minus seven, which is equal to negative 38. When n is equal to three, it's gonna be negative 31 minus seven times three minus one, which is just two, so we're gonna subtract seven twice. It's gonna be negative 31 minus 14, which is equal negative 45. What do we see happening here? We're starting at negative 31, and then we keep subtracting, we keep subtracting negative seven. We keep subtracting\\nnegative seven from that. In fact we subtract negative\\nseven one less than the term... We subtract negative seven one less times than the term we're dealing with. If we're dealing with the third term we subtract negative seven twice. If we're dealing with the second term we subtract negative seven once. This is all nice, but what I want you to\\ndo now is pause the video and see if you can define\\nthis exact same sequence. The sequence here is you\\nstart at negative 31, and you keep subtracting negative seven, so negative 38, negative 45. The next one is gonna be negative 52, and you go on and on and on. You keep subtracting negative seven. Can we define this sequence in terms of a recursive function? Why don't you have a go at that. Let's try to define it in\\nterms of a recursive function. Let's just call that g of n, so g of n. In some ways a recursive\\nfunction is easier, because you can say okay look. The first term when n is equal to one, if n is equal to one,\\nlet me just write it, If n is equal to one, if n is equal to one, what's g of n gonna be? It's gonna be negative 31, negative 31. And if n, if n is greater than\\none and a whole number, so this is gonna be defined\\nfor all positive integers, and whole, and whole number, it's just going to be the previous term, so g of n minus one minus seven, minus seven. We're saying hey if we're just picking an arbitrary term we just have to look at the previous term and then subtract, and\\nthen subtract seven. It all works out nice and easy, because you keep looking at previous, previous, previous terms all the way until you\\nget to the base case, which is when n is equal to one, and you can build up back from that. You get this exact same sequence. Let's do another example, but let's go the other way around. Here we have a, we have a sequence defined recursively, and I want to create a function that defines a sequence explicitly. Let's think about this. One way to think about it, this sequence, when n is equal to one it starts at 9.6, and then every term is the previous term minus 0.1. The second term is gonna\\nbe the previous term minus 0.1, so it's gonna be 9.5. Then you're gonna go to 9.4. Then you're gonna go to 9.3. We could keep going on and on and on. If we want, we could\\nmake a little table here, and we could say this is n, this is h of n, and you see when n is equal to one, h of n is 9.6. When n is equal to two, we're now in this case over here, it's gonna h of two minus one, so it's gonna be h of one minus 0.1. It's just gonna be this minus 0.1, which is going to be 9.5. When h is three, it's gonna be h of two, h of two minus 0.1, minus 0.1. H of two is right over here. You subtract a tenth you're gonna get 9.4, exactly what we saw over here. Let's see if we can pause the video now and define this... Create a function that\\nconstructs or defines this arithmetic sequence explicitly. Here it was recursively. We wanna define it explicitly. So let's just call it, I don't know, let's just call it f of n. We can say look, it's gonna be 9.6, but we're gonna subtract, we're gonna subtract 0.1 a certain number of times depending on what term\\nwe're talking about. We're gonna subtract 0.1, but how many times are\\nwe gonna subtract it as a function of n? Let's see. If we're talking about the first term we subtract zero times. The second term we subtract one time. The third term we subtract two times. The fourth term we subtract three times. Whatever term we're talking about we subtract that term minus one times. If we're talking about the nth term, we subtracted this\\nvalue n minus one times. You can verify that this is going to work. When n is equal to one this term here is going to be zero, so this whole thing is gonna be zero. You get 9.6. When n is equal to two, two minus one, you subtract 0.1 one time. 9.6 minus 0.1 is 9.5. You could keep doing that. You could draw a table, and evaluate these if you want to. The key thing is your'e starting at 9.6 and you're subtracting 0.1 one fewer times than the\\nterm you're looking at. If you're looking at the if n is equal to, this is n is equal to four, well you're gonna subtract 0.1 three times, and you see that.

       " '9.3.1': \"In this video I want to\\nintroduce you to the idea of a geometric sequence. And I have a ton of more\\nadvanced videos on the topic, but it's really a good place to\\nstart, just to understand what we're talking about\\nwhen someone tells you a geometric sequence. Now a good starting point is\\njust, what is a sequence? And a sequence is, you\\ncan imagine, just a progression of numbers. So for example, and this isn't\\neven a geometric series, if I just said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a sequence of numbers. It's not a geometric sequence,\\nbut it is a sequence. A geometric sequence is a\\nspecial progression, or a special sequence, of numbers,\\nwhere each successive number is a fixed multiple of\\nthe number before it. Let me explain what\\nI'm saying. So let's say my first number is\\n2 and then I multiply 2 by the number 3. So I multiply it\\nby 3, I get 6. And then I multiply 6 times the\\nnumber 3, and I get 18. Then I multiply 18 times the\\nnumber 3, and I get 54. And I just keep going\\nthat way. So I just keep multiplying\\nby the number 3. So I started, if we want to get\\nsome notation here, this is my first term. We'll call it a1 for\\nmy sequence. And each time I'm multiplying\\nit by a common number, and that number is often called\\nthe common ratio. So in this case, a1 is equal to\\n2, and my common ratio is equal to 3. So if someone were to tell\\nyou, hey, you've got a geometric sequence. a1 is equal to 90 and your\\ncommon ratio is equal to negative 1/3. That means that the first term\\nof your sequence is 90. The second term is negative\\n1/3 times 90. Which is what? That's negative 30, right? 1/3 times 90 is 30, and then you\\nput the negative number. Then the next number is going\\nto be 1/3 times this. So negative 1/3 times this. 1/3 times 30 is 10. The negatives cancel out,\\nso you get positive 10. Then the next number is going\\nto be 10 times negative 1/3, or negative 10/3. And then the next number is\\ngoing to be negative 10/3 times negative 1/3 so it's going\\nto be positive 10/3. And you could just keep going\\non with this sequence. So that's what people talk\\nabout when they mean a geometric sequence. I want to make one little\\ndistinction here. This always used to confuse me\\nbecause the terms are used very often in the\\nsame context. These are sequences. These are kind of a progression\\nof numbers. 2, then 6, then 18, 90, then\\nnegative 30, then 10, then negative 10/3. Then, I'm sorry, this is\\npositive 10/9, right? Negative 1/3 times negative\\n10/3, negatives cancel out. Right. 10/9. Don't want to make\\na mistake here. These are sequences. You might also see the\\nword a series. And you might even see\\na geometric series. A series, the most conventional\\nuse of the word series, means a sum\\nof a sequence. So for example, this is\\na geometric sequence. A geometric series would be 90\\nplus negative 30, plus 10, plus negative 10/3, plus 10/9. So a general way to view\\nit is that a series is the sum of a sequence. I just want to make that clear\\nbecause that used to confuse me a lot when I first learned\\nabout these things. But anyway, let's go back to\\nthe notion of a geometric sequence, and actually do a word\\nproblem that deals with one of these. So they're telling us that Anne\\ngoes bungee jumping off of a bridge above water. On the initial jump, the cord\\nstretches by 120 feet. So on a1, our initial\\njump, the cord stretches by 120 feet. We could write it this way. We could write, jump, and then\\nhow much the cord stretches. So on the initial jump,\\non jump one, the cord stretches 120 feet. Then it says, on the next\\nbounce, the stretch is 60% of the original jump, and then\\neach additional bounce stretches the rope 60% of\\nthe previous stretch. So here, the common ratio, where\\neach successive term in our sequence is going to be\\n60% of the previous term. Or it's going to be 0.6 times\\nthe previous term. So on the second jump, we're\\ngoing to start 60% of that, or 0.6 times 120. Which is equal to what? That's equal to 72. Then on the third jump, we're\\ngoing to stretch 0.6 of 72, or 0.6 times this. So it would be 0.6 times\\n0.6 times 120. Notice, over here, so on the\\nfourth jump we're going to have 0.6 times 0.6 times\\n0.6 times 120. 60% of this jump, so every\\ntime we're 60% of the previous jump. So if we wanted to make a\\ngeneral formula for this, just based on the way we've defined\\nit right here. So the stretch on the nth\\njump, what would it be? So let's see, we start at 120\\ntimes 0.6 to the what? To the n minus 1. How did I get this? Let me write this a\\nlittle bit here. So this is equal to 0.6,\\nactually let me write the 120 first. This is equal to 120\\ntimes 0.6 to the n minus 1. How did I get that? Well we're defining the first\\njump as stretching 120 feet. So when you put n is equal to 1\\nhere, you get 1 minus 1, 0. So you have 0.6 to the\\n0th power, and you've just got a 1 here. And that's exactly what happened\\non the first jump. Then on the second jump, you put\\na 2 minus 1, and notice 2 minus 1 is the first\\npower, and we have exactly one 0.6 here. So I figured it was n minus 1\\nbecause when n is 2, we have one 0.6, when n is 3, we have\\ntwo 0.6's multiplied by themselves. When n is 4, we have 0.6\\nto the third power. So whatever n is, we're taking\\n0.6 to the n minus 1 power, and of course we're multiplying\\nthat times 120. Now and the question they also\\nask us, what will be the rope stretch on the 12th bounce? And over here I'm going\\nto use the calculator. and actually let me correct\\nthis a little bit. This isn't incorrect, but\\nthey're talking about the bounce, and we could call the\\njump the zeroth bounce. Let me change that. This isn't wrong, but I think\\nthis is where they're going with the problem. So you can view the initial\\nstretch as the zeroth bounce. So instead of labeling it jump,\\nlet me label it bounce. So the initial stretch is the\\nzeroth bounce, then this would be the first bounce, the second bounce, the third bounce. And then our formula becomes\\na lot simpler. Because if you said the stretch\\non nth bounce, then the formula just becomes 0.6\\nto the n times 120, right? On the zeroth bounce, that was\\nour original stretch, you get 0.6 to the 0, that's\\n1 times 120. On the first bounce, 0.6 to\\nthe 1, one 0.6 right here. 0.6 times the previous\\nstretch, or the previous bounce. So this has it in terms of\\nbounces, which I think is what the questioner wants us to do. So what about the 12th bounce? Using this convention\\nright there. So if we do the 12th bounce,\\nlet's just get our calculator out. We're going to have 120 times\\n0.6 to the 12th power. And hopefully we'll get order\\nof operations right, because exponents take precedence over\\nmultiplication, so it'll just take the 0.6 to the\\n12th power only. And so this is equal\\nto 0.26 feet. So after your 12th bounce,\\nshe's going to be barely moving. She's going to be moving about\\n3 inches on that 12th bounce. Well, hopefully you found\\nthis helpful. And I apologize for the slight\\ndivergence here, but I actually think on some level\\nthat's instructive. Because you always have to make\\nsure that your n matches well with what your\\nresults are. So when I talked about\\nyour first jump, I said, OK this is 1. And then I had 0.6 to\\nthe zeroth power, so I did n minus 1. But then when I relabeled things\\nin terms of bounces, this was the zeroth bounce. This makes sense that this is\\n0.6 to the zeroth power. This is the first bounce,\\nso this would be 0.6 to the first power. Second bounce, 0.6 to\\nthe second power. It made our equation a\\nlittle bit simpler. Anyway, hopefully you found\\nthat Interesting. \",\n",
       " '9.3.2': \"- [Voiceover] So we're told\\nthat the first four terms of a geometric sequence are given. So they give us the first four terms. And they say what is the\\nfifth term in the sequence. And like always pause the video and see if you can come\\nup with the fifth term. Well what we have to remind ourselves is for a geometric sequence\\neach successive term is the previous term\\nmultiplied by some number. And that number we call the common ratio. So let's think about it. To go from negative 1/32,\\nthat's the first term to 1/8, what do we have to multiply by? What do we have to multiply by? Let's see. We're going to multiply, it's going to be multiplied by a negative since we went from a\\nnegative to a positive. So we're going to multiply by negative and there's going to be a one over let's see to go from a 32 to an eight, actually it's not going to be a one over. It's going to be, this is\\nfour times as large as that. It's going to be negative four. Negative 1/32 times negative\\nfour is positive 1/8. Just to make that clear. Negative 1/32 times negative four that's the same thing\\nas times negative four over one. It's going to be positive. Negative times a negative is a positive. Positive four over 32. Which is equal to 1/8. Now let's see if that holds up. So to go from 1/8 to negative 1/2 we once again would\\nmultiply by negative four. Negative four times 1/8 is negative 4/8, which is negative 1/2 and so then we multiply\\nby negative four again. So, let me make it clear. We're multiplying by\\nnegative four each time. You multiply by negative four again, you get to positive two. Because negative four over negative two, you can do it that way, is positive two. And so to get the fifth\\nterm in the sequence, we would multiply by negative four again. And so two times negative\\nfour is negative eight. Negative four is the common ratio for this geometric sequence. But just to answer the question, What is the fifth term? It is going to be negative eight. \",\n",
       " '9.3.3': \"- [Voiceover] The geometric\\nsequence A sub I is defined by the formula and so they\\ntell us that the Ith term is going to be equal to three\\ntimes negative one fourth to the I minus one power. So given that, what is A sub five, the fifth term in the sequence? So pause the video and try to figure out what is A subscript five? Alright, well, we can\\njust use this formula. A... A sub five is going to be... is everywhere I see an\\nI or a place with a five is going to be equal to three\\ntimes negative one fourth to the five minus one power. Well that's equal to three\\ntimes negative one fourth to the fourth power. Well that's going to be equal to... lets see, we're raising\\nit to an even power so it's going to give us a positive value since we're gonna be\\nmultiplying the negative an even number of times so\\nit's gonna be a positive value so it's gonna be three times... let's see, one to the one fourth is- oh, one to the fourth power is just one, and then four to the fourth power... let's see, four squared is 16, so four squared times four\\nsquared is four to the fourth so it's 16 times 16 is 256. 256. And once again I know\\nit's going to be positive because I'm multiplying a\\nnegative times itself four times, or I'm multiplying four\\nnegatives together, so that's going to give\\nme a positive value. So I get three over 256. And we're done. That's the fifth term in our sequence. Positive three over 256. \",\n",
       " '9.3.4': \"- [Voiceover] The\\ngeometric sequence a sub i, is defined by the formula\\nwhere the first term, a sub one is equal to negative 1/8, and then every term after\\nthat is defined as being, so a sub i is going to be two\\ntimes the term before that. A sub i is two times a sub i, minus one. What is a sub four, the\\nfourth term in the sequence? Pause the video, and see\\nif you can work this out. Well there's a couple of ways\\nthat you could tackle this. One is to just directly\\nuse these formulas. We could say that a sub four, well that's going to be\\nthis case right over here. A sub four is going to be\\nequal to two times a sub three. Well, a sub three, if we\\ngo and use this formula, is going to be equal\\nto two times a sub two. Each term is equal to two\\ntimes the term before it. Then we go back to this formula again, and say a sub two is going\\nto be two times a sub one. Two times a sub one. Lucky for us, we know that\\na sub one is negative 1/8. It's going to be two times negative 1/8, which is equal to negative 1/4. Negative 1/4. So this is negative 1/4. Two times negative 1/4,\\nis equal to negative 2/4, or negative 1/2. A sub four is two times a sub three. A sub three is negative 1/2. So this is going to be\\ntwo times negative 1/2, which is going to be\\nequal to negative one. So that's one way to solve it. Another way to think about it is, look, we have our initial term. We also know our common ratio. We know each successive term is two times the term before it. So we could explicitly, this is a recursive definition\\nfor our geometric series. We could explicitly write it as a sub i is going to be equal to our\\ninitial term negative 1/8. Then we're going to multiply it by two. We're going to multiply it\\nby two, i minus one times. So we could say times two,\\nto the i minus oneth power. Let's make sure that makes sense. A sub one, based on this formula, a sub one would be negative 1/8, times two to the one minus one. Two to the zeroeth power. So that makes sense. That would be negative 1/8. Based on this formula, a sub two would be negative 1/8, times two to the two minus one. So two to the first power. We're going to take our initial term, and multiply it by two, once. Which is exactly right. A sub two is negative 1/4. So we want to find the\\nfourth term in the sequence, we could just say well,\\nusing this explicit formula, we could say a sub four,\\nis equal to negative 1/8, times two to the four, minus one. Two to the four, minus one power. So this is equal to negative 1/8, times two to the third power. This is negative 1/8 times eight. Negative 1/8 times eight,\\nwhich is equal to negative one. You might be a little bit,\\na toss up on which method you want to use, but for\\nsure this second method, right over here where we'd come\\nup with an explicit formula once we know the initial term, and we know the common ratio, this would be way easier, if\\nyou were trying to find say, the 40th term. Because doing the 40th term\\nrecurs to be like this, would take a lot of time,\\nand frankly, a lot of paper. \",\n",
       " '9.4.1': \"- [Voiceover] So, this table here where you're given a bunch of Ns, N equals one, two, three, four, and we get the corresponding G of N. And one way to think about\\nit is that this function, G, defines a sequence where N\\nis the term of the sequence. So for example, we could\\nsay this is the same thing as the sequence where\\nthe first term is 168, second term is 84, third term is 42, and fourth term is 21,\\nand we keep going on, and on, and on. Now, let's think about what\\ntype of a sequence this is. If we think of it as starting at 168, and how do we go from 168 to 84? Well, one way, you could\\nsay we subtract at 84, but another way to think about it is you multiply it by one half. So, times one half. And then to go from 84 to 42, you multiply by one half again. Times one half. And to go from 42 to 21, you\\nmultiply by one half again. So, this right over here\\nis a geometric series. We're starting at a term\\nand every successive term is the previous term\\ntimes, it's often called the common ratio, times one half. So, how can we write G\\nof N, how can we define this explicitly in terms of N? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about how to do that. So, construct a, so,\\nif I say G of N equals, think of a function\\ndefinition that describes what we've just seen here starting at 168, and then multiplying\\nby one half every time you add a new term. Well, one way to think\\nabout it is we start at 168, and then we're gonna multiply by one half, we're gonna multiply by one\\nhalf a certain number of times. So, we could view the exponent\\nas the number of times we multiply by one half. And how many times are we\\ngonna multiply by one half? The first term, we multiply\\nby one half zero times. The second term, we multiply\\nby one half one time. Third term, we multiply\\nby one half two times. Fourth term, we multiply\\nby one half three times. So, the figure, it seems\\nlike whatever term we're on, we're multiplying by one half,\\nthat term minus one times. And you can see that this works. If N is equal to one, you're going to have one minus one, that's just gonna be zero. One half to the zero's just one. So, you're just gonna get a 168. If N is two, well, two minus one, you're gonna multiply\\nby one half one time, which you see right over here, N is three, you're gonna multiply by one half twice. Three minus two is, or,\\nthree minus one is two. You're gonna multiply by one half twice, and you see that right over there. So, this feels like a really\\nnice explicit definition for this geometric series. And you can think of it in other ways, you could write this\\nas G of N is equal to, let's see, one way you could write it, as, you could write it as 168,\\nand I'm just algebraically manipulating it over\\ntwo to the N minus one. Another way you could think about it is, well, let's use our exponent\\nproperties a little bit, we could say G of N is\\nequal to, let's see, one half to the N minus\\none, that's the same thing as one half, let me write this. It's equal to 168. Lemme do this in a different color. So, this part right over\\nhere is the same thing as one half to the N. So, times one half to\\nthe N, times one half to the negative one. One half to the negative one. Well, one half to the negative one is just two, is just two, so, this is times two. So, we could rewrite this whole thing as 168 times two is what? 336? 336, did I do that right? 160 times two would be 320, plus 16, two times eight, so yeah, 336. And then times one half to the N. Times one half to the N. So, these are equivalent statements. This one makes a little\\nbit more intuitive sense, it kinda jumps out at you,\\nyou're starting at 168 and you're multiplying by one half. Whatever term you are minus one times. But this is algebraically\\nequivalent to this, to our original one. But, can we also define\\nG of N recursively? And I encourage you to pause\\nthe video and try to do that. In a lot of ways, the recursive definition is a little bit more straight\\nforward, so let's do that. G, well, I'll make the\\nrecursive function a different, well, I got, I'll stick\\nwith G of N since it's on this table right over here. G of N is equal to, and so, let's see, if we're going to, when N equals one, if N is equal to one,\\nwe're starting at 168. 168, and if N is greater than one and a whole number, so, if N, so, we're, this is gonna be defined\\nover all positive integers, and whole number, what are we gonna do? Well, we're gonna take\\none half and multiply it times the previous term. So, it's gonna be one half\\ntimes G of N minus one. And you can verify that this works. If N is equal to one, we\\njust go right over here, it's gonna be 168. G of two is gonna be\\none half times G of one, which is, of course, 168. so, 168 times one half is 84. G of three is gonna be\\none half times G of two, which it is, G of three is\\none half times G of two. So, this is how we would define, this is the explicit\\ndefinition of this sequence, this is a recursive function\\nto define this sequence. \",\n",
       " '9.4.2': \"So I have the function g\\nof x is equal to 9 times 8 to the x minus 1 power. And it's defined for\\nx being a positive-- or if x is a positive-- integer. If x is a positive integer. So we could say the\\ndomain of this function, or all the valid inputs\\nhere are positive integers. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\\non and on and on. So this is an explicitly\\ndefined function. What I now want to do is to\\nwrite a recursive definition of this exact same function. That given an x, it'll give\\nthe exact same outputs. So let's first just try\\nto understand the inputs and outputs here. So let's make a little table. Let's make a table here. And let's think\\nabout what happens when we put in various x's\\ninto this function definition. So the domain is\\npositive integers. So let's try a couple of them. 1, 2, 3, 4. And then see what the\\ncorresponding g of x is. g of x. So when x is equal\\nto 1, g of x is 9 times 8 to the\\n1 minus 1 power, 9 times 8 to the 0\\npower, or 9 times 1. So g of x is going to be just 9. When x is 2, what's\\ngoing to happen? It'll be 9 times 8\\nto the 2 minus 1. So that's the same thing as\\n9 times 8 to the 1st power. And that's just going\\nto be 9 times 8. So that is 72. Actually let me just\\nwrite it that way. Let me write it\\nas just 9 times 8. 9 times 8. Then when x is equal to\\n3, what's going on here? Well this is going\\nto be 3 minus 1 is 2. So it's going to be 8 squared. So it's going to be\\n9 times 8 squared. So we could write that\\nas 9 times 8 times 8. I think you see a little\\nbit of a pattern forming. When x is 4, this is going to be\\n8 to the 4 minus 1 power, or 9 to the 3rd power. So that's 9 times\\n8 times 8 times 8. So this gives a\\ngood clue about how we would define\\nthis recursively. Notice, if our first term,\\nwhen x equals 1 is 9, every term after that is 8\\ntimes the preceding term. Is 8 times the preceding term. 8 times the preceding term. 8 times the preceding term. So let's define that as\\na recursive function. So first define our base case. So we could say\\ng of x-- and I'll do this is a new color\\nbecause I'm overusing the red. I like the blue. g of x. Well we can define\\nour base case. It's going to be equal\\nto 9 if x is equal to 1. g of x equals 9 if x equals 1. So that took care of\\nthat right over there. And then if it\\nequals anything else it equals the previous g of x. So if we're looking at--\\nlet's go all the way down to x minus 1, and then an x. So if this entry right over\\nhere is g of x minus 1, however many times\\nyou multiply the 8s and we have a 9 in front,\\nso this is g of x minus 1. We know that g of x-- we know\\nthat this one right over here is going to be the previous\\nentry, g of x minus 1. The previous entry times 8. So we could write\\nthat right here. Times 8. So for any other\\nx other than 1, g of x is equal to the previous\\nentry-- so it's g of-- I'll do that in a blue color--\\ng of x minus 1 times 8. If x is greater than 1, or\\nx is integer greater than 1. Now let's verify that\\nthis actually works. So let's draw\\nanother table here. So once again, we're\\ngoing to have x and we're going to have g of x. But this time we're going to\\nuse this recursive definition for g of x. And the reason\\nwhy it's recursive is it's referring to itself. In its own definition, it's\\nsaying hey, g of x, well if x doesn't equal 1 it's going\\nto be g of x minus 1. It's using the function itself. But we'll see that it\\nactually does work out. So let's see... When x is equal to 1, so g\\nof 1-- well if x equals 1, it's equal to 9. It's equal to 9. So that was pretty\\nstraightforward. What happens when x equals 2? Well when x equals 2, this\\ncase doesn't apply anymore. We go down to this case. So when x is equal\\nto 2 it's going to be equivalent\\nto g of 2 minus 1. Let me write this down. It's going to be equivalent\\nto g of 2 minus 1 times 8, which is the same thing\\nas g of 1 times 8. And what's g of 1? Well g of 1 is right over here. g of 1 is 9. So this is going to\\nbe equal to 9 times 8. Exactly what we got over here. And of course this was\\nequivalent to g of 2. So let me write this. This is g of 2. Let me scroll over\\na little bit so I don't get all scrunched up. So now let's go to 3. Let's go to 3. And right now I'll\\nwrite g of 3 first. So g of 3 is equal\\nto-- we're going to this case-- it's equal\\nto g of 3 minus 1 times 8. So that's equal\\nto g of 2 times 8. Well what's g of 2? Well g of 2, we already\\nfigured out is 9 times 8. So it's equal to 9 times 8--\\nthat's g of 2-- times 8 again. And so you see we get\\nthe exact same results. So this is the recursive\\ndefinition of this function. \",\n",
       " '9.5.1': \"- [Voiceover] Mohamed\\ndecides to track the number of leaves on the tree in\\nhis backyard each year. The first year, there were 500 leaves. Each year thereafter, the number of leaves was 40% more than the year before. Let n be a positive integer,\\nand let f of n denote the number of leaves on\\nthe tree in Mohamed's back yard in the nth year\\nsince he started tracking it. The expression f of n defines a sequence. What kind of sequence is f of n? So, some of you might be able to think about this in your head. Each successive year we're growing by 40%, that's the same thing\\nas multiplying by 1.4. Each successive term we're multiplying or dividing by the same number. Well, that's going to be geometric. Let's make that a little\\nbit more tangible, just in case. So, let's make a little table here. So, table. So, this is n and this is f of n. So when n is equal to one, the first year, n equals\\none, there were 500 leaves. F of n is 500. Now, when n is equal to two we're going to grow by 40%, which is the same thing as multiplying by 1.4. So 500 times 1.4, let's\\ndo 40% of 500 is 200, so we're going to grow by 200, so we're going to go to 700. Then in year three, we're\\ngoing to grow by 40% of 700, which is 280, so\\nit's going to grow to 980. Notice it's definitely not\\nan arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence, we would be adding or subtracting the same amount every time, but we're not. Here, from 500 to 700, we grew by 200, and then from 700 to 980, we grew by 280. Instead, we're multiplying or dividing by the same amount each time. In this case, we're multiplying by 1.4, by 1.4 each time. So we are clearly geometric. Depending on your answer\\nto the question above, the recursive definition\\nof the sequence can have one of the following two forms. Well this is the arithmetic form, which we know isn't the case,\\nso it's going to be in the geometric form. And then they ask us, what are the values of the parameters A\\nand B for the sequence? So we have our base case\\nhere, f of n is going to be equal to A when n is equal to one. Well, we know that when n equals one, we had 500 leaves on the\\ntree so A, this A over here, is 500, so A is 500, and then if we're not in the base case for any other year, we are going to have,\\nlet's see, it's going to be the previous year, the\\nprevious year times what? It's going to be the\\nprevious year grown by 40%, to grow by 40%, you're\\ngoing to multiply by 1.4 so B is going to be 1.4. You take the previous\\nyear and you multiply by 1.4 for any other year, any year other than n equals one. So, B is equal to 1.4, and we're done. Let's do another example. This is strangely fun. All right, so this says:\\nSeo-Yun hosted a party. She had 50 party favors\\nto give away, and she gave away three party\\nfavors to each of her guests as they arrived at the party. Let n be a positive integer,\\nand let g of n denote the number of party\\nfavors Seo-Yun had before the nth guest arrived. All right, actually, before I\\neven look at these questions, let me make a table here\\nbecause they're saying before the nth guest. I want to make sure I'm\\nunderstanding this properly. So this is n, and then this is going to be g of n, right over here. So, when n is equal to one, when n is equal to one,\\ng of n is going to be, or g of one is going to be\\nthe number of party favors Seo-Yun had before the first guest. Well, before the first guest,\\nshe had 50 party favors. She had 50 party favors. Now, the second guest comes. Now the number of party\\nfavors she had before the second guest, well,\\nshe had to give three to the first guest, so she's now going to have 47 party favors. Now, when n is equal to three, how many party favors did she have before the third guest? Well, she would've had\\nto give party favors to the first and second\\nguest, who each got three. So, she would have 44, and\\nI think you see the pattern. For every time n, when n\\nequals one, g of n is 50, and every time we increase n by one, every time we increment\\nn, we are increasing g of n by plus three, by\\nminus three, I should say because she's giving away\\nparty favors, minus three. Minus three. So because the difference\\nbetween successive terms is the same, we know this\\nis an arithmetic sequence. This is an arithmetic\\nsequence and then they say write an explicit\\nformula for the sequence. So let's think about this. Let's see, g of n is\\ngoing to be equal to... Let's see, we're going to start at 50 then we're going to subtract\\nthree, and let's think, do we subtract three times n or is it...? Let's see, for the first guest, we subtract three zero times. For the second guest,\\nwe subtract three once. For the third guest, we\\nsubtract three twice. So, for the nth guest, we're\\ngoing to subtract three n minus one time. Notice, for the nth guest,\\nwe subtracted three twice. The second guest, subtracted three once. First guest, subtracted three zero times, so this works out. For the first guest, we would\\nsubtract three zero times, and so g of one would be 50. We can see that this is\\nconsistent for all of these. So I could write 50 minus\\nthree times n minus one, and I really recommend\\nmaking the table here just so you make sure\\nyou get the n minus one or the n right and it all gels. \",\n",
       " '9.6.1': '- [Voiceover] So we\\'ve\\ngot the function g here, and what I want you to\\ndo is pause the video and figure out what g of one is, figure out what g of two is, g of three, and g of four. Figure out what all four of these are. All right, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. So g of one, if n is equal to one, well, then we\\'re gonna hit\\nthis case right over here, if n is equal to one, g is equal to four. So that was pretty straightforward. Now, g of two, if n is equal to two, well, two is greater than\\none and it\\'s a whole number, and so we would use this case. And this is interesting, because it\\'s defined in\\nterms of the function, but it\\'s not defined in terms of g of n, but g of n minus one. So if n is two, \\'cause we\\'re\\nevaluating g of two here, this is going to be g of two minus one, or g of one, plus 3.2. Plus 3.2. Well, what\\'s that going to be? Well, g of one, we know is equal to four. We just figured that out. So four plus 3.2, that is 7.2. All right, let\\'s keep going. G of three, we\\'re gonna\\nfall into this case again, because three is greater than\\none and it\\'s a whole number. So this is going to be\\ng of three minus one, or g of two, plus 3.2. Plus 3.2. Well, we know what g of two is. It\\'s 7.2. We just figured that out. It is 7.2. 7.2 plus 3.2 is going to be equal to 10.4. And then g of four,\\nwell, we fall here again. This is gonna be g of three plus 3.2. G of three plus 3.2. What is that going to be equal to? Well, g of three we just\\nfigured out is 10.4. 10.4 plus 3.2 is going to be 13.6. And so what you have here, this is actually quite interesting. You can think of this function g, and we see that it\\'s defined\\nover all positive integers. Because it\\'s defined\\nover positive integers, we could think of it\\nas defining a sequence, and we see what the sequence here is. The first term is four, second term is 7.2, next term is 10.4, next term is 13.6, and it could keep going on and on and on. And what\\'s happening? What\\'s\\nhappening in this sequence? Well, we\\'re starting with four. We\\'re starting with four, and this case of the\\nfunction gave us that. If n is equal to four, if n is equal to one, the function is going to be equal to four, and then for each term after that, you take the previous\\nterm and you add 3.2. So we add 3.2 for the\\nsecond term, we add 3.2, so we just keep adding, we just keep adding 3.2, not .32, 3.2 to get to the next term. Now, we could\\'ve defined it\\nthat way, we could\\'ve said, \"Hey, let\\'s have a sequence\\nwhere the first term is four \"and then we keep adding\\n3.2 to get each next term.\" But this is another\\ninteresting way of defining it. And this way of defining it, where we defined it as\\nan algebraic function, a function that\\'s defined\\nover all positive integers, where we have a base case. And a base case, really, in this case, gave us our first term, and then we have this other case that\\'s defined in terms of the function. Then you have to recurse backwards to eventually get to a base case. We call this a recursive function. Recursive function. So with this example, we\\'re seeing how a recursive function can be used to define an actual sequence. And we went in order here, but you could\\'ve gone\\nthe other way around. If I said, \"Oh, well, what\\'s g of, \"what\\'s g of six?\" Well, you\\'d go into this case, you\\'d say, \"OK, that\\'s going to\\nbe g of five plus 3.2.\" It\\'s gonna be the previous term plus 3.2 if we view it as a sequence. Well, then we\\'re gonna have to figure out what the previous term is. G of five is going to be g of four, g of four plus 3.2, and you would keep going\\nback and back and back, but we\\'ve already figured\\nout what g of four is. It\\'s 13.6, so this is 16.8, and then if g of five is 16.8, 16.8, you add 3.2 there, you would get 20. So you could start at g of\\nsix and keep backing up, all the way until you get to g of one, and then you figure out what that is. You recurse back to your base case, and then you\\'re able to\\nfill in all of the blanks. Let\\'s do a few more examples of this. So we have this function here. So let\\'s say that this defines a sequence. Let\\'s think about what\\nthe first four terms of that sequence are, and once again, I encourage you to pause the\\nvideo and figure that out. All right, let\\'s work through it. So h of one is, well,\\nthey very clearly tell us that\\'s going to be 14. If n is equal to one, h is 14. H of two, well, now we\\'re falling into this case, \\'cause two is greater than\\none and it\\'s a whole number, so it\\'s gonna be 28 over h of one, over h of one. Well, we know h of one is 14, so it\\'s gonna be 28 over\\n14, which is equal to two. Now h of three. H of three, we\\'re gonna\\nfall into this case again. It\\'s gonna be 28, 28 divided by h of two, if we\\'re thinking of this as a sequence, divided by the previous\\nterm in the sequence. So 28 divided by h of two, we know that h of two is equal to, is equal to two. We just figured that out. So we go back to 14,\\nsomething very interesting. I think you see where this is going. H of four is gonna be 28\\ndivided by h of three, 28 divided by h of three, which is 28 divided by, this is h of three right over here, we just figured that out, divided by 14, which is back to two. If we were to think of this as a sequence, we\\'d say, \"All right, let\\'s\\nsee, the first term is 14, \"then we get to two, \"then we go to 14, \"then we get to two.\" So one way to think about this sequence is that we just keep alternating\\nbetween 14 and twos. All of the odd terms\\nof the sequence are 14, all of the even terms\\nof the sequence are two. That\\'s one way to think about it. Or another way to think about it is, we\\'re starting with 14, and each successive term is\\nthe previous term divided, is 28 divided by the previous term. So here, 28 divided by 14 is two. 28 divided by two is 14.\\n28 divided by 14 is two. And we keep going on and on and on, and that\\'s what was actually\\ngoing on right over there. Let\\'s do one more of these. And this one is interesting, because we now have, we now have two base cases. So let\\'s think about this. This is, and actually let\\'s just say we wanted to figure out, we\\nwanted to figure out what, what f of four is. F of four, well, we\\'re\\ngonna fall into this case. Four is greater than two\\nand it\\'s a whole number. It\\'s gonna be f of four minus two, so it\\'s gonna be f of two\\nplus f of four minus one, plus f of three. So f of four is gonna be the sum of the preceding two numbers. All right, so let\\'s figure out what f of three is going to be. F of three, we fall into this case again, it\\'s gonna be f of three\\nminus two is f of one, plus f of three minus one, plus f of two, the sum of the preceding two numbers. So let\\'s figure out what\\nf of two is going to be. Well, now we\\'re not doing the sum of the preceding two numbers anymore. We fall into this base\\ncase. N is now equal to two. It\\'s going to be equal to negative four. And we\\'re gonna have to figure out what f of one is as well. And we see when n is equal to one, f is equal to negative six. We have two base cases right over here. Base cases, cases that aren\\'t defined in terms of the function itself. And you need that, \\'cause otherwise you\\'d\\njust be recursing forever. You would never get to actual numbers. But now we can use these to\\nfill in the values up here. So the sequence is negative six, then we go to negative\\nfour as the second term, and then the third term is\\nthe sum of the previous two. Negative six plus negative\\nfour is negative 10. Negative six plus negative\\nfour is negative 10. And then the fourth term is\\nthe sum of the previous two. We see it right over here. The second term, f of\\ntwo, plus f of three. Negative four plus\\nnegative 10 is negative 14. And we could keep going on\\nand on and on like that. So this right over here is negative 14. So the whole point of this video, you\\'re a little bit familiar\\nwith recursive functions now, and also you can see how these can be used to define actual sequences. ',\n",
       " '9.6.2': \"- [Instructor] The focus\\nof this video is going to be on sequences, which you have hopefully already seen. If you don't know what a sequence is, I encourage you to review\\nthose videos on Khan Academy. But we're going to focus on how we can generate the same sequence with different functions\\nthat have different domains. So let's just start with\\nan example sequence. Let's say we have a sequence. It's a six. You could call that the first term. Some people would call\\nthat the zeroth term, six. And then if that's the first term, the second term is now a 12, then a 24, then a 48, and so on and so forth. And as we'll see, there's\\nmultiple function definitions that could create the sequence. One way to think about it\\nis this is six times one. This is six times two. This is six times four. This is six times eight. So it looks like each term is six times a power of two. Let me make that clear. This one right over here is\\nsix times two to the zero. That's six times one. This one over here is six\\ntimes two to the first. This one over here is\\nsix times two squared, six times four. This right over here is six times two to the third. And so one way to view this is if you view this as the zeroth term. We could define a function, call it a of n, where n is referring to our index or which term in the sequence. And it's equal to six times two, six times two to the n, where n starts at zero, and then it keeps incrementing by one. So it's really all integers\\ngreater than or equal to zero. And it's very important\\nto specify that domain, where n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to zero. You could see what happens\\nif n is not an integer. If you tried to put a 1.5 year or something like that,\\nthen you're not going to get one of the terms in the sequence. And if we don't start at\\nzero, if we started at one, then this would be the\\nfirst term in the sequences, which is not what we want. We want to generate the sequence that I originally wrote down. And obviously, if you started\\nat n equals negative one, then you're gonna get a different\\nvalue for your first term. So this is one way to essentially define or create a function which generates this sequence. But as we'll see, there\\nare other ways to do it. For example, let me do another one. I'll do it in another color. Let's say I have b of n. And let's say I want to, instead of saying, okay, I'm\\ngonna start at n equals zero, and you could kind of view\\nthis as the zeroth term, I want to start at n equals one. So what you could do is, is when you input a one, this\\nessentially becomes a zero. How do I do that? Well, I just subtract one from it. So I could say six times two to the n minus one power, where n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to one. Notice, now when we put\\nn equals one in here, we could maybe call this the first term. We want to generate a six. So what happens? One minus one, we get that zeroth power that we want right over there. And so six times two to\\nthe zero is indeed six. Then when n is equal to two, it's six times two to the two minus one, which is just two to the first power. So it just becomes six times\\ntwo, which is equal to 12. So notice, these are\\ndifferent function definitions with different domains, but they're generating\\nthe exact same sequence. We could also do it recursively. And we've seen this in other videos. We can define a function recursively. We could say, all right, look, it looks like each of these terms in our sequence is\\ntwice the previous term. So we could, if we want a recursive\\ndefinition for the sequence, we can define the first term, or, in this case, we\\ncould say the zeroth term if we want to start at n equals zero. T of zero is equal to six. And then we could say t of n is equal to two times t of n minus one, t of n minus one. And then this is going to be for, or maybe I'll write it this way, where n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to zero. This would also generate the sequence. When you put n equals zero\\nhere, you'll get that term. When you get n equals one, t of one is going to be two times t of one minus one, t of zero. In that case, it'd be t of, or, sorry, it would be two\\ntimes t of zero is six. So two times six, it would get you 12. Now if you wanted it so\\nthat it generates the six when n equals one, you\\ncould do it this way. You could write it, actually, maybe I should\\nhave kept all of that, or I'm gonna have to rewrite all of that. But you could write it this way. Instead of saying t of\\nzero is equal to six, we could write t of one is equal to six. But now we'd have to\\nwrite a different domain, where n still has to be an integer. N is an integer. And now instead of saying n is greater than or equal to zero, now n is greater than or equal to one. So hopefully this video\\nhits the point home that there's multiple ways, either with a traditional, I guess you would say explicit function or a recursive function like this. And even in either of those cases, you could have different domains and different function definitions that generate the same sequence, but you really have to\\nthink about the domain. \",\n",
       " '10.1.1': \"- [Instructor] This right over here is the graph of y is equal\\nto absolute value of x which you might be familiar with. If you take x is equal to negative two, the absolute value of\\nthat is going to be two. Negative one, absolute value is one. Zero, absolute value is zero. One, absolute value is one. So on and so forth. What I wanna do in this video is think about how the\\nequation will change if we were to shift this graph. So in particular, we're\\ngonna first think about what would be the equation\\nof this graph if we shift, if we shift three to the right and then think about how that will change if not only do we shift three to the right but we also shift four up, shift four up, and so once again pause this\\nvideo like we always say and figure out what would the equation be if you shift three to\\nthe right and four up? Alright, now let's do this together. So let's just first\\nshift three to the right and think about how that\\nmight change the equation. So let's just visualize what\\nwe're even talking about. So if we're gonna shift\\nthree to the right, it would look like, it would look like this. So that's what we first wanna\\nfigure out the equation for and so how would we think about it? Well, one way to think about it is, well, something interesting is happening right over here at x equals three. Before, that interesting\\nthing was happening at x equals zero. Now, it's happening at x equals three. And the interesting\\nthing that happens here is that you switch signs\\ninside the absolute value. Instead of taking an\\nabsolute value of a negative, you're now taking the absolute value as you cross this point of a positive and that's why we see a\\nswitch in direction here of this line and so you see the same thing\\nhappening right over here. So at this point right over here, we know that our function, we know that our equation\\nneeds to evaluate out to zero and this is where it's\\ngoing to switch signs and so we say, okay, well, this\\nlooks like an absolute value so it's going to have the form, y is equal to the absolute\\nvalue of something and so you say, okay, if x is three, how do I make that equal to zero? Well, I can subtract three from it. If I say y is equal to the\\nabsolute value of x minus three, well, let's try it out. Let's see if it makes sense. So when x is equal to three, three minus three is zero, absolute value of that is zero. That works out. When x is equal to four, four minus three is one,\\nabsolute value of one is indeed, is indeed one. And if x is equal to two, well, two minus three is negative one but the absolute value of that is one. So once again, I'm showing you this by really trying out numbers, trying to give you a\\nlittle bit of an intuition because that wasn't obvious to\\nme when I first learned this that if I'm shifting to the right which it looks like I'm\\nincreasing an x value but what I would really do is replace my x with an x minus the amount\\nthat I'm shifting to the right but I encourage you to try numbers and think about what's happening here. At this vertex right over here, whatever was in the absolute\\nvalue sign was equaling zero. It's when whatever was in\\nthe absolute value sign is switching from negative\\nsigns to positive signs. So once again, if you\\nshift three to the right, that has to happen at x equals three. So whatever is inside\\nthe absolute value sign has to be equal to zero at\\nx equals three and this, pause this video and\\nreally think about this if it isn't making sense and even as you get more\\nand more familiar with this, I encourage you to try out the numbers. That will give you more,\\ninstead of just memorizing, hey, if I shift to the right, I replace x with x minus\\nthe amount that I shift. Always try out the numbers\\nand try to get an intuition for that why that works. But now, let's start from\\nhere and shift four up and shifting four up is in\\nsome ways a lot more intuitive. So let me do that. Let me shift four up. Alright, so let me move. I'm gonna go up one, two, three and four. I think I got that right. So now I've shifted four up. And just as a reminder\\nof what we've even done, the first part we shifted\\nthree to the right and now we are shifting four up. So now, now we are shifting four up. So before, y equaled zero here but now, y needs to be equal to four. So whatever this was evaluating, do we now have to add four to it? So when we just shifted\\nthree to the right, our equation was y is\\nequal to the absolute value of x minus three but now whatever we were getting before, we now have to add four to it. We're going up in the vertical direction. So we just have to add four. Now, this makes a little bit more sense. If you're shifting in\\nthe vertical direction, if you shift up in the vertical direction, well, you just add a constant\\nby the amount you're shifting. If you shift down in\\nthe vertical direction, well, you would subtract. If we said shift down four, you would subtract four right over here. The less intuitive thing\\nis what we did with x 'cause when you shift to the right, you actually replace your x with x minus the amount that you shifted but once again, try out numbers until it really makes some\\nintuitive sense for you but this is what we would finally get. The equation of this thing right over here is y is equal to the absolute value of x minus three plus four. \",\n",
       " '10.1.2': \"- [Instructor] The graph of y is equal to absolute value of x is reflected across the x-axis and then scaled vertically\\nby a factor of seven. What is the equation of the new graph? So pause the video and see\\nif you can figure that out. Alright, let's work\\nthrough it together now. Now, you might not need\\nto draw it visually but I will just so that\\nwe can all together visualize what is going on. So let's say that's my x-axis and that is my y-axis. y equals the absolute value of x. So for non-negative values of x, y is going to be equal to x. Absolute value of zero is zero. Absolute value of one is one. Absolute value of two is two. So it's gonna look like this. It's gonna have a slope of one and then for negative values, when you take the absolute value, you're gonna take the opposite. You're gonna get the positive. So it's gonna look like this. Let me see if I can draw\\nthat a little bit cleaner. This is a hand drawn\\nsketch so bear with me but hopefully this is familiar. You've seen the graph of y is equal to absolute\\nvalue of x before. Now, let's think about the\\ndifferent transformations. So first, they say is\\nreflected across the x-axis. So for example, if I have some x value right over here, before, I would take\\nthe absolute value of x and I would end up there but now we wanna reflect across the x-axis so we wanna essentially get\\nthe negative of that value associated with that corresponding x and so for example, this x, before, we would get\\nthe absolute value of x but now we wanna flip across the x-axis and we wanna get the negative of it. So in general, what we are doing is we are getting the negative\\nof the absolute value of x. In general, if you're\\nflipping over the x-axis, you're getting the negative. You're scaling the expression\\nor the function by a negative. So this is going to be y\\nis equal to the negative of the absolute value of x. Once again, whatever absolute value of x was giving you before for given x, we now wanna get the negative of it. We now wanna get the negative of it. So that's what reflecting\\nacross the x-axis does for us but then they say scaled\\nvertically by a factor of seven and the way I view that is if\\nyou're scaling it vertically by a factor of seven, whatever y value you got for given x, you now wanna get seven times the y value, seven times the y value for a given x. And so if you think\\nabout that algebraically, well, if I want seven times the y value, I'd have to multiply this thing by seven. So I would get y is\\nequal to negative seven times the absolute value of x and that's essentially\\nwhat they're asking, what is the equation of the new graph, and so that's what it would be. The negative flips us over the x-axis and then the seven scales\\nvertically by a factor of seven but just to understand\\nwhat this would look like, well, you multiply zero times seven, it doesn't change anything but whatever x this is, this was equal to negative x but now we're gonna get\\nto negative seven x. So let's see, two, three,\\nfour, five, six, seven so it'd put it something around that. So our graph is now going to look, is now going to look like this. It's going to be stretched\\nalong the vertical axis. If we were scaling vertically by something that had an\\nabsolute value less than one then it would make the graph less tall. It would make it look, it would make it look wider. Let me make it at least look\\na little bit more symmetric. So it's gonna look something, something like that but the key issue and the reason why I'm\\ndrawing is so you can see that it looks like it's\\nbeing scaled vertically. It's being stretched in\\nthe vertical direction by a factor of seven and the\\nway we do that algebraically is we multiply by seven and the negative here is what\\nflipped us over the x-axis. \",\n",
       " '10.1.3': '- [Instructor] Function\\nG can be thought of as a stretched or compressed version of F of X is equal to\\nthe absolute value of X. What is the equation for G of X? So you can see F of X is equal to the absolute value of X here in blue, and then G of X, not only does it look\\nstressed or compressed, but it also is flipped over the X axis. So like always, pause this video and see if you can up yourself with the equation for G of X. Alright, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. So there\\'s a couple of\\nways we could do it. We could first try to flip F of X, and then try to stretch or compress it, or we could stretch or compress it first, and then try to flip it. Let\\'s actually, let\\'s flip it first, so let\\'s say that we have a function that looks like this. It\\'s just exactly what F of X is, but flipped over the X axis. So it\\'s just flipped over the X axis, so all the values for any given X, whatever Y you used to get, you\\'re not getting the negative of that. So this graph right over here, this would be the graph. I\\'ll call this, Y is equal to the negative absolute value of X. Whatever the absolute value of X would have gotten you before, you\\'re now going to get the negative of the opposite of it. So this is getting us\\ncloser to our definition of G of X. The key here is how do\\nwe appropriately stretch or squeeze this green function? So let\\'s think about what\\'s happening. On this green function, when X is equal to one, the function itself is\\nequal to negative one, but we want it, if we want\\nit to be the same as G, we want it to be equal to negative four. So it\\'s actually four times the value. For a given X, at least for X equals one, G is giving me something\\nfour times the value that my green function is giving. That\\'s not just true for positive Xs. It\\'s also true for negative Xs. You can see it right over here. When X is equal to negative one, my green function gives me negative one, but G gives me negative four. So it\\'s giving me four times the value. It\\'s giving me four\\ntimes the negative value, so it\\'s going even more negative, so what you can see, to\\ngo from the green to G, you have to multiply this\\nthing right over here by four. So that is what essentially\\nstretches it down, stretches it down in\\nthe vertical direction. So we could say that G of X is equal to, it\\'s not negative absolute value of X, negative four times the\\nabsolute value of X. And you could have done it the other way. You could have said,\\n\"Hey, let\\'s first stretch \"or compress F.\" And say, alright, before\\nwe even flip it over, if we were to unflip G, it would look like this. If we were to unflip G, it would look like this. If were to unflip G, so this thing right over here, this thing looks like four times F of X. We could write this as Y is equal to four times F of X, or you could say Y is equal to four times the absolute value of X, and then we have a negative sign. Whatever positive value\\nyou were getting before, you now get the opposite value, and that would flip it\\nover and get you to G, which is exactly what we already got. ',\n",
       " '10.1.4': \"- [Instructor] So we're asked\\nto graph f of x is equal to two times the absolute value\\nof x plus three, plus two. And what they've already graphed for us, this right over here, this is the graph of y is equal\\nto the absolute value of x. So let's do this through a\\nseries of transformations. So the next thing I wanna graph, let's see if we can graph y. Y is equal is to the absolute\\nvalue of x plus three. Now in previous videos\\nwe have talked about it. If you replace your x, with an x plus three, this is going to shift your\\ngraph to the left by three. You could view this as the same thing as y is equal to the absolute\\nvalue of x minus negative three. And whatever you're\\nsubtracting from this x, that is how much you are shifting it. So you're going to shift\\nit three to the left. And we're gonna do that right now and then we're gonna just gonna\\nconfirm that it matches up. That it makes sense. So let's first graph that. Get my ruler tool here. So if we shift three to the left, it's gonna look something like... It's gonna look something like this. So on that... When whatever we have inside the absolute\\nvalue sign is positive, we're going to get\\nessentially, this slope of one. And whenever we have inside the absolute\\nvalue sign is negative, we're gonna have a slope of\\nessentially negative one. So it's going to look... It's going to look like that. And let's confirm whether\\nthis actually makes sense. Below x equals negative three, for x values less than negative three, what we're gonna have here, is this inside of the absolute value sign, is going to be negative and so then we're gonna\\ntake it's opposite value and so that makes sense. That's why you have this\\ndownward line right over here. Now for x is greater than negative three, when you add three to it, you're\\ngonna get a positive value and so that's why you have\\nthis upward sloping line right over here. And at x equals negative three, you have zero inside\\nthe absolute value sign, just as if you didn't shift it, you would have had zero\\ninside the absolute value sign at x equals zero. So hopefully that makes a\\nlittle bit more intuitive sense of why if you replace x, if you replace x with x plus three, and this isn't just true of\\nabsolute value functions, this is true of any function, if you replace x with x plus three, you are going to shift three to the left. All right, now let's keep building. Now let's see if we can graph y is equal to two times the\\nabsolute value of x plus three. So what this is essentially going to do is multiple the slopes by a factor of two. It's going to stretch it\\nvertically by a factor of two. So for x values greater\\nthan negative three, instead of having a slope of one, you're gonna have a slope of two. So let me get my ruler out again and see if I can draw that. So let me put that there. And then, so here instead\\nof a slope of one, I'm gonna have a slope of two. Let me draw that. It's gonna look like\\nthat, right over there. And then instead of having\\na slope of negative one for values less than x\\nequals negative three, I'm gonna have a slope of negative two. Let me draw that right over there. So that is the graph of y is equal to two times the absolute\\nvalue of x plus three. And now to get to the f\\nof x that we care about, we now need to add this two. So now I wanna graph, and\\nwe're in the home stretch, I wanna graph, y is equal to two times the absolute value of\\nx plus three, plus two. Well whatever y value I was getting for this orange function,\\nI now wanna add two to it. So this is just gonna shift\\nit up vertically by two. So instead of... So this is gonna be shifted up by two. This is going to be shifted. Every point is going to shifted up by two or you can think about shifting\\nup the entire graph by two. Here, in the orange function, whatever y value I got\\nfor the black function, I'm gonna have to get two more than that. And so it's going to look... It's going to look like this. So let me see, I'm shifting it up by two. So for x less than negative\\nthree, it'll look like that. And for x greater than negative three, it is going to look like... It is going to look like that. And there you have it. This is the graph of y\\nor f of x is equal to two times the absolute value\\nof x plus three, plus two. And you could've done\\nit in different ways. You could have shifted up two first, then you could have\\nmultiplied by a factor of two, and then you could have shifted, and then, so you could have moved up two first, then you coulda multiplied\\nby a factor of two, then you could've shifted left by three. Or could have multiplied\\nby a factor of two first, shifted up two and then shifted over. So there's multiple, there's three transformations\\ngoing up here. This is an... This is a, let me color them all. So this right over here tells me... This over here says hey, shift left. Shift left by three. This told us, stretch vertically by two. Or essentially multiply the slope by two. Stretch vert by two. And then that last piece, says shift up by two. Shift up by two, which gives us our\\nfinal result for f of x. \",\n",
       " '10.2.1': \"- [Voiceover] By now we're used to seeing functions defined like h(y)=y^2 or f(x)= to the square root of x. But what we're now going to explore is functions that are\\ndefined piece by piece over different intervals\\nand functions like this you'll sometimes\\nview them as a piecewise, or these types of function definitions they might be called a\\npiecewise function definition. Let's take a look at this\\ngraph right over here. This graph, you can see that the function is constant over this interval, 4x. And then it jumps up\\nin this interval for x, and then it jumps back down\\nfor this interval for x. Let's think about how we would write this using our function notation. If we say that this right\\nover here is the x-axis and this is the y=f(x) axis. Then, let's see, our function\\nf(x) is going to be equal to, there's three different intervals. So let me give myself some space for the three different intervals. Now this first interval\\nis from, not including -9, and I have this open circle here. Not a closed in circle. So not including -9 but\\nx being greater than -9 and all the way up to and including -5. I could write that as -9 is less than x, less than or equal to -5. That's this interval, and what is the value of the function\\nover this interval? Well we see, the value\\nof the function is -9. It's a constant -9 over that interval. It's a little confusing because the value of the function is actually also the value of the lower bound on this\\ninterval right over here. It's very important to look at\\nthis says, -9 is less than x, not less than or equal. If it was less than or\\nequal, then the function would have been defined at\\nx equals -9, but it's not. We have an open circle right over there. But now let's look at the next interval. The next interval is\\nfrom -5 is less than x, which is less than or equal to -1. Over that interval, the\\nfunction is equal to, the function is a constant 6. It jumps up here. Sometimes people call this a\\nstep function, it steps up. It looks like stairs to some degree. Now it's very important\\nhere, that at x equals -5, for it to be defined only one place. Here it's defined by this part. It's only defined over here. So that's why it's\\nimportant that this isn't a -5 is less than or equal to. Because then if you put\\n-5 into the function, this thing would be filled in, and then the function would\\nbe defined both places and that's not cool for a function, it wouldn't be a function anymore. So it's very important that when you input - 5 in here, you know which\\nof these intervals you are in. You can't be in two of these intervals. If you are in two of these intervals, the intervals should\\ngive you the same values so that the function maps, from one input to the same output. Now let's keep going. We have this last\\ninterval where we're going from -1 to 9. >From -1 to +9. And x starts off with -1 less than x, because you have an open\\ncircle right over here and that's good because X equals -1 is defined up here, all the way to x is\\nless than or equal to 9. Over that interval, what is\\nthe value of our function? Well you see, the value of\\nour function is a constant -7. A constant -7 and we're done. We have just constructed a piece by piece definition\\nof this function. Actually, when you see this\\ntype of function notation, it becomes a lot clearer why function notation is useful even. Hopefully you enjoyed that. I always find these piecewise\\nfunctions a lot of fun. \",\n",
       " '10.2.2': \"- [Instructor] Consider the\\nfollowing piecewise function and we say f(t) is equal to and they tell us what it's equal to based on what t is, so if t is less than or equal to -10, we use this case. If t is between -10 and -2, we use this case. And if t is greater than or equal to -2, we use this case. And then they ask us what is the value of f(-10)? So t is going to be equal to -10, so which case do we use? So let's see. If t is less than or equal to -10, we use this top case, right over here and t is equal to -10, that's the one that\\nwe're trying to evaluate. So we wanna use this case right over here. So f(-10) is going to be equal to -10, everywhere we see a t here, we substitute it with a -10. - 10 squared minus 5 times, actually I don't have a denominator there, I don't know why I wrote it so high. So it's gonna be -10\\nsquared minus 5 times -10. So let's see. - 10 squared, that's positive 100 and then negative, or subtracting 5 times -10, this is going to be subtracting -50 or you're going to add 50, so this is going to be equal to 150. f(10) is 150, 'cause we used this case up here, 'cause t is -10. Let's do another one of these examples. So, here we have consider the following\\npiecewise function, alright. What is the value of h(-3)? See when h is -3, which case do we use? We use this case if our x\\nis between negative infinity and zero. And -3 is in between\\nnegative infinity and zero, so we're gonna use this\\ncase right over here. If it was positive three, we would use this case. If it was positive 30, we would use this case. So we're going to use the first case again and so for h(-3), we're gonna take -3 to the third power. So let's see. h(-3) is going to be -3 to the third power which is -27. And we're done. That's h(-3). Because we're using this case, you could almost ignore\\nthese second two cases right over here. Let's do one more example. This one's a little bit different. Below is a graph of the step function g(x) so we can see g(x) right over here. It starts when x equals -9, it's at 3, and then it jumps up, and then it jumps down. Match each expression with its value. So g(-3.0001), so -3.0001, so that's right over here and g of that, we see is equal to 3. So this is going to be\\nequal to 3 right over here. g(3.99999) 3.99999, almost 4, so let's draw a dotted line right here, it's gonna be almost 4, well g(3.99999) is going to be 7. We see that right over there. So that is equal to 7. g(4.00001). So g(4) is still 7, but as soon as we go above 4, we drop down over here, so g(4.00001) is going to be -3. I wanna, actually, let's focus\\non that a little bit more. How did I know that? Well I know that g(4) is 7 and not -3 because we have this dot\\nis circled in up here and it's hollow down here. But as soon as we get\\nany amount larger than 4, then the function drops down to this. So 4.0000, as many, just slightly above 4, the value of our function\\nis going to be -3. Now let's do g(9). So g(9), that's when x is 9 and we go down here. You might be tempted to say it's -3, but you see, at this\\npoint right over here, we have an open circle. So that means that while it's not, you can't say that the\\nfunction is -3 right over there and there's no other place\\nwhere we have a filled-in circle for x equals 9 so the function g actually\\nisn't defined at x equals 9. So I'm gonna put undefined\\nright over there. \",\n",
       " '10.2.3': \"- [Voiceover] So, I\\nhave this somewhat hairy function definition here, and I want to see if we can graph it. And this is a piecewise function. It's defined as a different,\\nessentially different lines. You see this right over here,\\neven with all the decimals and the negative signs,\\nthis is essentially a line. It's defined by this line\\nover this interval for x, this line over this interval of x, and this line over this interval of x. Well, let's see if we can graph it. I encourage you, especially\\nif you have some graph paper, to see if you can graph\\nthis on your own first before I work through it. So, let's think about this first interval. When negative 10 is\\nless than or equal to x, which is less than negative two, then our function is defined\\nby negative 0.125x plus 4.75. So this is going to be a\\nline, a downward sloping line, and the easiest way I can\\nthink about graphing it is let's just plot the endpoints\\nhere, and then draw the line. So, when x is equal to 10, sorry, when x is equal to\\nnegative 10, so we would have negative zero, actually\\nlet me write it this way. Let me do it over here where I do the, so we're going to have negative 0.125 times negative 10 plus 4.75. That is going to be equal to, let's see, the negative times a\\nnegative is a positive, and then 10 times this is\\ngoing to be 1.25 plus 4.75. That is going to be equal to six. So, we're going to have the\\npoint negative 10 comma six. And that point, and it\\nincludes, so x is defined there, it's less than or equal to, and then we go all the\\nway to negative two. So, when x is equal to negative\\ntwo, we have negative 0.125 times negative two plus 4.75 is equal to, see negative times negative is positive, two times this is going to be point, is going to be positive 0.25 plus 4.75. It's going to be equal to positive five. Now, we might be tempted,\\nwe might be tempted, to just circle in this dot over here, but remember, this interval\\ndoes not include negative two. It's up to and including,\\nit's up to negative two, not including. So, I'm gonna put a\\nlittle open circle there, and then I'm gonna draw the line. And then I'm gonna draw the line. I am going to draw my best\\nattempt, my best attempt, at the line. Now, let's do the next interval. The next interval, this one's\\na lot more straightforward. We started x equals negative\\ntwo, when x equals negative two negative two plus seven is,\\nnegative two plus seven is five. So, negative two, so\\nnegative two comma five, so it actually includes\\nthat point right over there. So we're actually able to fill it in, and then when x is negative one, negative one plus seven is\\ngoing to be positive six. Positive six, but we're not\\nincluding x equals negative one up to and including, so it's\\ngoing to be right over here. When x is negative one,\\nwe are approaching, or as x approaches negative\\none, we're approaching negative one plus seven is six. So, that's that interval right over there. And now let's look at this last interval. This last interval,\\nwhen x is negative one, you're going to have, well, this is just going\\nto be positive 12 over 11 'cause we're multiplying\\nit by negative one, plus 54 over 11 which\\nis equal to 66 over 11 which is equal to positive six. So, we're able to fill\\nin that right over there, and then when x is equal to 10, you have negative 120 over 11. I just multiplied this times 10, 12 times 10 is 120, and\\nwe have the negative, plus 54 over 11. So this is the same thing. This is going to be, what is this? This is negative 66\\nover 11, is that right? Let's see, if you, yeah,\\nthat is negative 66 over 11, which is equal to negative six. So when x is equal to 10, our function is equal to negative six. And so this one actually\\ndoesn't have any jumps in it. It could've, but we see,\\nso there we have it. We have graphed this function\\nthat has been defined in a piecewise way. \",\n",
       " '10.2.4': \"I have a piecewise defined function here,\\nand my goal is to figure out its domain and its range. So first let's think about the\\ndomain. And just a bit overview, the domain is\\nthe set of all inputs for which our function is defined. \\nAnd over here, an input variable is x, so to think about, it's the set of all\\nthe values that x can take on, and actually have this function be defined,\\nand actually figure out what f of x is. And when we look at this, we see, okay, if 0 is\\nless than x is less than or equal to 2. We're in this clause, it's x crosses 2 and it is greater than 2.\\nWe follow this clause As we approach 6 but right when we get\\nto 6, we fall into this clause right over here, all the way up to and including 11. \\nBut if we get larger than 11, the function is no longer defined. I don't know which of\\nthese to use. And if we're 0 or less, the function is\\nlonger defined as well. So in order for this to be defined, x has\\nto be greater than 0 or if we say 0 is less than x, and you see that part right over there.\\nAnd x has to be less than or equal to 11. and x has to be less then or equal to 11. It's defined for everything in between. \\nAs we, as we see, once again, as we get to 2, we're here.\\nAs we cross 2, between 2 and 6, we're here, and at 6, from 6 to 11 we're over here. So we're defined for all real\\nnumbers in this interval. So our domain is -- actually let me write this all, all real values, are all real all real values. maybe -- Let me write that way.  All real value such\\nthat, such that, 0 is less than x, is less than\\nor equal to 11. So now think about the range.\\nLet's think about the range of this piecewise\\ndefined function. And that's a set of all values that this\\nfunction can actually take on. and this one is, is maybe deceptively\\nsimple because there're only three values that this function can take on. You can take on, f of x can be equal to\\n1. It can be equal to 5, or it could be equal to negative 7. So the range here, we could say that f of x needs to be a member of, \\nthis is just a fancy mathy symbol, just to say this is a member of the set 1, 5, negative 7. f of x is going to take, is going to take on one of these three\\nvalues. Another way to say it is that f of x is going to be equal 1, 5 or negative 7. This is maybe a little less -- a little -- a less a less mathy way, a less precise way of saying the same thing. But one way\\nor another, f of x can only take on one over these three values. \",\n",
       " '10.2.5': \"So we have a piecewise linear function\\nright over here for different intervals of x. g of x is defined by a a line or the line changes depending\\nwhat interval of x we're actually in. And so let's think about its domain, and\\nthen we'll think about its range. So the domain of this, this is a review.\\nThe domain is the set of all inputs for which this function is defined, and our input\\nvariable here is x. This is a set of all x values for which\\nthis function is defined. And we see here. Anything, anything negative 6 or\\nlower, our function isn't defined. If it, if x is negative 6 or or lower than that. I don't --\\nit doesn't, it doesn't fall into one of these three intervals. So there is no definition for it. \\nIt doesn't say hey do this in all other cases for x. It is just saying, look, if x falls into one of these three\\nconditions, apply this. And if x doesn't fall into one of those three\\nconditions, well this function g is just not defined. So, to fall into one of these three, you have\\nto be at least greater than negative 6. So this part right over here, the low end\\nof our domain is defined right over there, so we say, we could say, negative 6 is less than x and I'm leaving --\\nso let's write it here. All real numbers -- actually\\nlet me write this way x, I could write it more math-y. I could say x is a member of the real numbers such that, such that negative 6 is less than x. Negative 6 is less than x and I also think about the upper bound.\\nSo as x goes, I just wanna make sure that we fill in all the gaps between x being a greater than negative 6 and\\nx is less than or equal to 6. So let's see. As we go up to and including negative 3,\\nwe're in this clause. As soon as we cross negative 3, we fall into this clause up to 4, but\\nas soon as we get 4, we're in this clause up to and including 6. So x at the high end is said to be less than\\nor equal to 6, less then or equal to 6. Now another way to say this and kind of less math-y notation is x, x can be any real number, any the real number such that, such that negative 6 is less than x is less than or equal to 6. These two\\nstatements are equivalent. So now let's think about\\nthe range of this function. Let's think about the range, and the range\\nis, this is the set of all inputs , oh sorry, this is the set of all\\noutputs that this function can take on, or all the\\nvalues that this function can take on. And to do that, let's just think about\\nas x goes, but x varies or x can be any values in this\\ninterval. What are the different values\\nthat g of x could take on? Let's think about that. g of x is going\\nto be between what and what? g of x is going to be between what and\\nwhat? g of x is going to be between what and\\nwhat? And it might actually, this might be some\\nequal signs there but I'm gonna worry about that in a second. So when does this thing hit its low\\npoint? o this thing hits, hits its low point when x is as small as possible. An x is\\ngoing to be as small as possible when x is approaching negative 6. So if x were equal to negative 6, it can't\\nequal negative 6 herer but if x is equal to negative 6, then this thing over here\\nwould be equal to negative 6 plus 7, would be, would be 1. So if x is greater than negative 6,  g of x is going to be greater than 1, or another way\\nto think about it is if negative 6 is less than x, then 1 is going to be less than g of x. And the reason I said that is if I put negative 6\\ninto this, negative 6 plus 7 is equal to 1. Now this gonna hit a\\nhigh end when it as large as possible. The largest value in this interval that\\nwe can take on is x being equal to negative 3.\\nSo when x is equal to negative 3, negative 3 plus 7 is equal to 4, positive 4. And it can actually take on\\nthat value because this is less than or equal to, so we can actually take on\\nx equals negative 3 in which case g of x actually\\nwill take on positive 4. So, let' do that for each of these. \\nNow here we have 1 minus x, so this is going to take on\\nits smallest value when x is as large as possible. So the largest value x can approach for,\\nit can't quite take on for, but it's going to approach for. So if x, let's see, if we said x was 4,\\nalthough that's not this clause here, 1 minus x, 1 minus 4 is negative 3. So as long as x is less than 4, then negative 3 is going to be less than g of x. I wanna make sure that makes sense\\nto you because it can be little bit confusing because this takes on its minimum value when x is approaching, or it's\\napproaching its minimum value when x is approaching its, when x is\\napproaching its maximum because we're subtracting it. So if you take the upper end, even though\\nthis doesn't actually include 4, but as we approach for, we could say, OK, 1 negative 4 is negative 3 so that's, so g of x\\nis always going to be greater than that, as well it's going to be\\ngoing to be a less than. Well what happens as we approach x being equal to negative 3? So, 1 minus negative 3 is going to be positive 4. So this is going to be positive\\n4 right over here. And these are both less than, not less\\nthan or equal to because these are both less than right\\nover here. And now let's think about this right over here. So 2x minus 11 is gonna hit its maximum value\\nwhen x is as large as possible. So its maximum value's going to be hit\\nwhen x is equal to 6 So 2 times 6 is 12, minus 11.\\nWell that's going to be 1. So its maximum value's going to be 1.\\nIt's actually going to be able to hit because x can be equal to 6. Its minimum value is going to be when x\\nis equal to 4, and actually can be equal to 4. We have this less than or equal sign right over there.\\nSo 2 times 4 is 8, minus 11 is negative 3. So, g of x in this case\\ncan get as low as negative 3 when x is equal to 4. So now let's think about all of, all of the\\nvalues that g of x can take on. So we could say, we could write this a bunch of ways,\\nwe could write g of x is going to be a member of the real\\nnumbers such that -- let's see. What's the lowest\\nvalue g of x can take on? g of x can get as low as negative 3.\\nIt can even be equal to negative 3. This one just has been greater the\\nnegative 3, but here can be greater than or equal to negative 3. \\nSo negative 3 is less than or equal to g of x, and it\\ncan get as high as, it can get as high as Let's see. It's defined all the way to \\n1 and then -- or I shouldn't say it is defined all the way to 1.\\nIt can take on values up to 1 but it can also take on values beyond 1.\\nIt can take on values all the way up to including 4 over here. So it can take on values up to and including 4. So g of x is a member\\nreal numbers such that negative 3 is less than or equal to g of x\\nis less than or equal to 4. So the set of all values\\nthat g of x can take on between, including and including negative 3 and positive 4. \",\n",
       " '11.1.1': \"- [Narrator] Let's get some practice with our exponent properties, especially when we have integer exponents. So, let's think about what\\nfour to the negative three times four to the fifth power is going to be equal to. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it on your own. Well there's a couple of ways to do this. See look, I'm multiplying two things that have the same base, so this is going to be that base, four. And then I add the exponents. Four to the negative three plus five power which is equal to four\\nto the second power. And that's just a straight\\nforward exponent property, but you can also think about why does that actually make sense. Four to the negative 3 power, that is one over four to the third power, or you could view that as one over four times four times four. And then four to the fifth, that's five fours being\\nmultiplied together. So it's times four times four times four times four times four. And so notice, when you multiply this out, you're going to have five\\nfours in the numerator and three fours in the denominator. And so, three of these in the denominator are going to cancel out with three of these in the numerator. And so you're going to be left with five minus three, or negative three plus five fours. So this four times four is the same thing as four squared. Now let's do one with variables. So let's say that you have A to the negative fourth power times A to the, let's say, A squared. What is that going to be? Well once again, you have the same base, in this case it's A, and so\\nsince I'm multiplying them, you can just add the exponents. So it's going to be A to the\\nnegative four plus two power. Which is equal to A to\\nthe negative two power. And once again, it should make sense. This right over here, that is one over A times A times A times A and then this is times A times A, so that cancels with that,\\nthat cancels with that, and you're still left\\nwith one over A times A, which is the same thing as\\nA to the negative two power. Now, let's do it with some quotients. So, what if I were to ask you, what is 12 to the negative seven divided by 12 to the negative five power? Well, when you're dividing, you subtract exponents if\\nyou have the same base. So, this is going to be equal to 12 to the negative seven minus negative five power. You're subtracting the bottom exponent and so, this is going to\\nbe equal to 12 to the, subtracting a negative is the same thing as adding the positive, twelve to the negative two power. And once again, we just\\nhave to think about, why does this actually make sense? Well, you could actually rewrite this. 12 to the negative seven divided by 12 to the negative five, that's the same thing as\\n12 to the negative seven times 12 to the fifth power. If we take the reciprocal\\nof this right over here, you would make exponent positive and then you would get\\nexactly what we were doing in those previous examples with products. And so, let's just do one more with variables for good measure. Let's say I have X to the\\nnegative twentieth power divided by X to the fifth power. Well once again, we have the same base and we're taking a quotient. So, this is going to be X to\\nthe negative 20 minus five cause we have this one right\\nover here in the denominator. So, this is going to be equal to X to the negative twenty-fifth power. And once again, you could\\nview our original expression as X to the negative twentieth and having an X to the\\nfifth in the denominator dividing by X to the fifth is the same thing as multiplying by X to the negative five. So here you just add the exponents and once again you would get X to the negative twenty-fifth power. \",\n",
       " '11.1.2': '- [Instructor] Do some example, raising exponents or products of exponents to various powers, especially when we\\'re dealing\\nwith integer exponents. So let\\'s say we have three\\nto the negative eight times seven to the third, and we wanna raise that\\nto the negative two power, and I want you to pause this video and see if you could\\nsimplify this on your own. So the key realization here, there\\'s couple of ways\\nthat you can tackle it, but the key thing to realize is if you have the product of two things, and then you\\'re raising that\\nto some type of a exponent, that is going to be the same thing as raising each of these\\nthings to that exponent, and then taking the product. So this is going to be the same thing as three to the negative eight, and then that to the negative two times seven to the third\\nto the negative two, so I\\'ll do seven to the\\nthird right over here. And if I wanna simplify this, three to the negative\\neight to the negative two, we have the other exponent property that if you\\'re raising to an exponent and then raising that whole\\nthing to another exponent, then you can just multiply the exponents. So this is going to be\\nthree to the negative eight times negative two power. Well, negative eight times negative two is positive 16, so this is gonna be\\nthree to the 16th power right over there, and then this part right over here, seven to the third to the negative two. that\\'s gonna be seven to the three times negative two, which is seven to the\\nnegative sixth power. So that is seven to the negative six, and this would be about as\\nmuch as you could simplify. You could rewrite it different ways. Seven to the negative\\nsix is the same thing as one over seven to the sixth, so you could write it\\nlike three to the 16th. We\\'ll use that same shade of blue, three to the 16th over seven to the sixth, but these two are equivalent, and there\\'s other ways that\\nyou could have tackled this. You could have said that this original thing right over here, this is the same thing as, three to the negative eight is the same thing as one\\nover three to the eighth, so you could have said\\nthis is the same thing as seven to the third over three to the eighth, and then you\\'re raising\\nthat to the negative two, in which case you\\'d raise this\\nnumerator to the negative two and the denominator to negative two, but you would have gotten\\nto the exact same place. Let\\'s do another one of these. So let\\'s say that we have got A to the negative two times\\neight to the seventh power, and we wanna raise all of\\nthat to the second power. Well, like before, I can\\nraise each of these things to the second power, so this is the same thing\\nas A to the negative two to the second power times this thing to the second power. Eight to the seventh to the second power, and then here, negative two\\ntimes two is negative four, so that\\'s A to the negative four times, eight to the seven times two is 14, eight to the 14th power. In other videos, we go into more depth about why this should\\nhopefully make intuitive sense. Here you have eight to the seventh times eight to the seventh. Well, you would then\\nadd the two exponents, and you would get to eight to the 14th, so however many times you\\nhave eight to the seventh, you would just keep adding the exponents, or you would multiply by\\nseven that many times. Hopefully that didn\\'t sound too confusing, but the general idea is if you\\nraise something to exponent and then another exponent, you can multiply those exponents. Let\\'s do one more example where we are dealing with quotients, which that first example could have even been perceived as. So let\\'s say we have two to the negative 10 divided by four squared, and we\\'re gonna raise all of\\nthat to the seventh power. Well, this is equivalent\\nto two to the negative 10 raised to the seventh power over four squared raised\\nto the seventh power, so if you have the\\ndifference of two things and you\\'re raising it to some power, that\\'s the same thing as a numerator raised to that power divided by the denominator\\nraised to that power. Well, what\\'s our numerator going to be? Well, we\\'ve done this drill before. It\\'d be two to the negative\\n10 times seventh power, so this would be equal to two\\nto the negative 70th power, and then in the denominator, four to the second power, then that raised to the seventh power. Well, two times seven is 14, so that\\'s going to be four to the 17th power. Now, we actually could think about simplifying this even more. There\\'s multiple ways that\\nyou could rewrite this, but one thing you could\\ndo is say, \"Hey, look, \"four is a power of two.\" So you could rewrite this as this is equal to two to the\\nnegative 70th power over, instead of writing four to the 17th power, why did I write the 17th power? It should be four to the 14th power. Let me correct that. Instead of writing four to the 14th power, I instead could write, so this is two, get the colors right. This is two to the negative 70th over, instead of writing four, I could write two squared\\nto the 14th power. Four is the same thing as two squared, and so now I can rewrite this whole thing as two to the negative 70th power over, well, two to the second, and then that to the 14th, well, that\\'s two to the 28th power, two to the 28th power. And so can I simplify this even more? Well, this is going to be equal to two to the, if I\\'m taking a quotient\\nwith the same base, I can subtract the exponent. So it\\'s gonna be negative 70. It\\'s going to be negative 70 minus 28th power, minus 28, and so this is going to simply two to the negative 98th power, and that\\'s another way of\\nviewing the same expression. ',\n",
       " '11.2.1': \"- [Voiceover] If you're\\nwatching a movie and someone is attempting to do fancy\\nmathematics on a chalkboard, you'll almost always see a\\nsymbol that looks like this. This radical symbol. And this is used to show the square root and we'll see other\\ntypes of roots as well, but your question is, well, what does this thing actually mean? And now that we know a\\nlittle bit about exponents, we'll see that the square\\nroot symbol or the root symbol or the radical is not\\nso hard to understand. So, let's start with an example. So, we know that three to\\nthe second power is what? Three squared is what? Well, that's the same\\nthing as three times three and that's going to be equal to nine. But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the nine, and we said, well, what times\\nitself is equal to nine? We already know that answer is three, but how could we use a\\nsymbol that tells us that? So, as you can imagine,\\nthat symbol is going to be the radical here. So, we could write the\\nsquare root of nine, and when you look at\\nthis way, you say, okay, what squared is equal to nine? And you would say, well,\\nthis is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, three. And I want you to really look at these two equations right over here, because this is the essence\\nof the square root symbol. If you say the square root of nine, you're saying what times\\nitself is equal to nine? And, well, that's going to be three. And three squared is equal\\nto nine, I can do that again. I can do that many times. I can write four, four\\nsquared, is equal to 16. Well, what's the square\\nroot of 16 going to be? Well, it's going to be equal to four. Let me do it again. Actually, let me start\\nwith the square root. What is the square root of 25 going to be? Well, this is the number that\\ntimes itself is going to be equal to 25 or the number,\\nwhere if I were to square it, I'd get to 25. Well, what number is that, well, that's going to be equal to five. Why, because we know that\\nfive squared is equal to, five squared is equal to 25. Now, I know that there's a nagging feeling that some of you might be having, because if I were to take negative three, and square it, and square\\nit I would also get positive nine, and the same\\nthing if I were to take negative four and I were\\nto square the whole thing, I would also get positive\\n16, or negative five, and if I square that I\\nwould also get positive 25. So, why couldn't this thing\\nright over here, why can't this square root be positive\\nthree or negative three? Well, depending on who you talk to, that's actually a reasonable\\nthing to think about. But when you see a\\nradical symbol like this, people usually call\\nthis the principal root. Principal root. Principal, principal square root. Square root. And another way to think\\nabout it, it's the positive, this is going to be the\\npositive square root. If someone wants the\\nnegative square root of nine, they might say something like this. They might say the negative,\\nlet me scroll up a little bit, they might say something like the negative square root of nine. Well, that's going to be\\nequal to negative three. And what's interesting\\nabout this is, well, if you square both sides\\nof this, of this equation, if you were to square both\\nsides of this equation, what do you get? Well negative, anything negative\\nsquared becomes a positive. And then the square root\\nof nine squared, well, that's just going to be nine. And on the right-hand side,\\nnegative three squared, well, negative three times\\nnegative three is positive nine. So, it all works out. Nine is equal, nine is equal to nine. And so this is an\\ninteresting thing, actually. Let me write this a little\\nbit more algebraically now. If we were to write, if we were to write the principal root of nine is equal to x. This is, there's only one\\npossible x here that satisfies it, because the standard convention, what most mathematicians\\nhave agreed to view this radical symbol as, is that this is a principal square root, this\\nis the positive square root, so there's only one x here. There's only one x that\\nwould satisfy this, and that is x is equal to three. Now, if I were to write x\\nsquared is equal to nine, now, this is slightly different. X equals three definitely satisfies this. This could be x equals\\nthree, but the other thing, the other x that satisfies this is x could also be\\nequal to negative three, 'cause negative three squared\\nis also equal to nine. So, these two things,\\nthese two statements, are almost equivalent,\\nalthough when you're looking at this one, there's two\\nx's that satisfy this one, while there's only one x\\nthat satisfies this one, because this is a positive square root. If people wanted to write\\nsomething equivalent where you would have two\\nx's that could satisfy it, you might see something like this. Plus or minus square root\\nof nine is equal to x, and now x could take on positive\\nthree or negative three. \",\n",
       " '11.2.2': \"We're asked to find the\\nsquare root of 100. Let me write this down bigger. So the square root is this\\nbig check-looking thing. The square root of 100. When you see it like this,\\nthis means the positive square root. If you're familiar with negative\\nnumbers, you know that there's also a negative\\nsquare root, but when you just see this symbol, that means\\nthe positive square root. So let's think about what\\nthis is saying. This is asking us find the\\nnumber, the positive number, that when I multiply that number\\nby itself, I get 100. So what number when I multiply\\nit by itself do I get 100? Well, let's see, if I multiply\\n9 by itself, that's only going to be 81. If I multiply 10 by itself,\\nthat is 100. So this is equal to-- and let\\nme write it this way. Normally, you could\\nskip this step. But you could write this as\\nthe square root of-- and instead of 100, 100 is the same\\nthing as 10 times 10. And then you know, the square\\nroot of something times itself, that's just going\\nto be that something. This is just equal to 10. So the square root\\nof 100 is 10. Or another way you could write,\\nI guess, this same truth is that 10 squared, which\\nis equal to 10 times 10, is equal to 100. \",\n",
       " '11.2.3': \"- Let's see if we can solve the equation P squared is equal to 0.81. So how could we think about this? Well one thing we could\\ndo is we could say, look if P squared is equal to 0.81, another way of expressing\\nthis is, that well, that means that P is going to be equal\\nto the positive or negative square root of 0.81. Remember if we just wrote\\nthe square root symbol here, that means the principal root, or just the positive square root. But here P could be positive\\nor negative, because if you square it, if you square\\neven a negative number, you're still going to\\nget a positive value. So we could write that P is equal to the plus or minus square root of 0.81, which kind of helps us, it's another way of expressing the same,\\nthe same, equation. But still, what could P be? In your brain, you might\\nimmediately say, well okay, you know if this was P\\nsquared is equal to 81, I kinda know what's going on. Because I know that nine\\ntimes nine is equal to 81. Or we could write that nine\\nsquared is equal to 81, or we could write that nine is equal to the principal root of 81. These are all, I guess,\\nsaying the same truth about the universe, but what about 0.81? Well 0.81 has two digits behind,\\nto the right of the decimal and so if I were to\\nmultiply something that has one digit to the right of\\nthe decimal times itself, I'm gonna have something with two digits to the right of the decimal. And so what happens if I\\ntake, instead of nine squared, what happens if I take 0.9 squared? Let me try that out. Zero, I'm gonna use a different color. So let's say I took 0.9 squared. 0.9 squared, well that's going to be 0.9 times 0.9, which is going to be equal to? Well nine times nine is 81,\\nand I have one, two, numbers to the right of the decimal,\\nso I'm gonna have two numbers to the right of\\nthe decimal in the product. So one, two. So that\\nindeed is equal to 0.81. In fact we could write\\n0.81 as 0.9 squared. So we could write this,\\nwe could write that P is equal to the plus or\\nminus, the square root of, instead of writing 0.81, I could write that as 0.9 squared. In fact I could also write\\nthat as negative 0.9 squared. Cause if you put a negative\\nhere and a negative here, it's still not going to change the value. A negative times a negative\\nis going to be a positive. I could, actually I would\\nhave put a negative there, which would have implied a negative here and a negative there. So either of those are going to be true. But it's going to work out for us because we are taking the\\npositive and negative square root. So this is going to be, P is going to be equal\\nto plus or minus 0.9. Plus or minus 0.9, or we could write it that P is equal to 0.9, or P could be equal to negative 0.9. And you can verify that, you would square either of\\nthese things, you get 0.81. \",\n",
       " '11.2.4': \"- [Voiceover] We already know a little bit about square roots. For example, if I were to tell you that seven squared is equal to 49, that's equivalent to saying that seven is equal to the square root of 49. The square root essentially unwinds taking the square of something. In fact, we could write it like this. We could write the square root of 49, so this is whatever number times itself is equal to 49. If I multiply that number times itself, if I square it, well I'm going to get 49. And that's going to be\\ntrue for any number, not just 49. If I write the square root of X and if I were to square it, that's going to be equal to X and that's going to be true for any X for which we can evaluate the square root, evaluate the principle root. Now typically and as you advance in math you're going to see that this will change, but typically you say,\\nokay if I'm going to take the square root of something,\\nX has to be non-negative. X has to be non-negative. This is going to change\\nonce we start thinking about imaginary and complex numbers, but typically for the\\nprinciple square root, we assume that whatever's\\nunder the radical, whatever's under here, is\\ngoing to be non-negative because it's hard to square a number at least the numbers that we know about, it's hard to square them\\nand get a negative number. So for this thing to be\\ndefined, for it to make sense, it's typical to say\\nthat, okay we need to put a non-negative number in here. But anyway, the focus of this video is not on the square root, it's\\nreally just to review things so we can start thinking\\nabout the cube root. And as you can imagine,\\nwhere does the whole notion of taking a square of something\\nor a square root come from? Well it comes from the notion of finding the area of a square. If I have a square like this\\nand if this side is seven, well if it's a square, all the\\nsides are going to be seven. And if I wanted to find the area of this, it would be seven times\\nseven or seven squared. That would be the area of this. Or if I were to say, well what is if I have a square, if I have, and that doesn't look\\nlike a perfect square, but you get the idea, all the\\nsides are the same length. If I have a square with area X. If the area here is X, what are the lengths of\\nthe sides going to be? Well it's going to be square root of X. All of the sides are\\ngoing to be the square root of X, so it's going to be the square root\\nof X by the square root of X and this side is going to\\nbe the square root of X as well and that's going to be\\nthe square root of X as well. So that's where the term\\nsquare root comes from, where the square comes from. Now what do you think cube root? Well same idea. If I have a cube. If I have a cube. Let me do my best attempt at\\ndrawing a cube really fast. If I have a cube and a\\ncube, all of it's dimensions have the same length so this\\nis a two, by two, by two cube, what's the volume over here. Well the volume is going to\\nbe two, times two, times two, which is two to the\\nthird power or two cubed. This is two cubed. That's why they use the word cubed because this would be the volume of a cube where each of its sides have length two and this of course is\\ngoing to be equal to eight. But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the cube? What if we started with this volume? What if we started with a cube's volume and let's say the volume\\nhere is eight cubic units, so volume is equal to eight and we wanted to find\\nthe lengths of the sides. So we wanted to figure out what X is cause that's X, that's X, and that's X. It's a cube so all the\\ndimensions have the same length. Well there's two ways that\\nwe could express this. We could say that X times X times X or X to the third power is equal to eight or we could use the cube root symbol, which is a radical with a\\nlittle three in the right place. Or we could write that X is equal to, it's going to look very\\nsimilar to the square root. This would be the square root of eight, but to make it clear,\\nthey were talking about the cube root of eight, we would write a little three over there. In theory for square root, you could put a little two over here, but that'd be redundant. If there's no number here, people just assume that\\nit's the square root. But if you're figuring out the cube root or sometimes you say the third root, well then you have to say, well you have to put this\\nlittle three right over here in this little notch in the\\nradical symbol right over here. And so this is saying X\\nis going to be some number that if I cube it, I get eight. So with that out of the way, let's do some examples. Let's say that I have... Let's say that I want to calculate the cube root of 27. What's that going to be? Well if say that this is\\ngoing to be equal to X, this is equivalent to\\nsaying that X to the third or that 27 is equal to\\nX to the third power. So what is X going to be? Well X times X times X is equal to 27, well the number I can think of is three, so we would say that X, let\\nme scroll down a little bit, X is equal to three. Now let me ask you a question. Can we write something like... Can we pick a new color? The cube root of, let\\nme write negative 64. I already talked about\\nthat if we're talking the square root, it's fairly typical that hey you put a negative number in there at least until we learn\\nabout imaginary numbers, we don't know what to do with it. But can we do something with this? Well if I cube something,\\ncan I get a negative number? Sure. So if I say this is equal to X, this is the same thing as\\nsaying that negative 64 is equal to X to the third power. Well what could X be? Well what happens if\\nyou take negative four times negative four times negative four? Negative four times four is positive 16, but then times negative\\nfour is negative 64 is equal to negative 64. So what could X be here? Well X could be equal to negative four. X could be equal to negative four. So based on the math that we know so far you actually can take the cube\\nroot of a negative number. And just so you know, you\\ndon't have to stop there. You could take a fourth root and in this case you'd have a four here, a fifth root, a sixth root, a seventh root of numbers and we'll talk about that later in your mathematical career. But most of what you're going to see is actually going to be square root and every now and then you're\\ngoing to see a cube root. Now you might be saying, well hey look, you know, you just knew that\\nthree to the third power is 27, you took the cube root, you get X, is there any simple way to do this? And like you know if i give\\nyou an arbitrary number. If I were to just say, I don't know, if I were to say cube root of 125. And the simple answer is, well the easiest way to\\nactually figure this out is actually just to do a factorization and particular prime\\nfactorization of this thing right over here and then\\nyou would figure it out. So you would say, okay\\nwell 125 is five times 25, which is five times five. Alright, so this is the same\\nthing as the cube root of five to the third power, which of course, is going to be equal to five. If you have a much larger number here, yes, there's no very simple way to compute what a cube root or a fourth root or a fifth root might\\nbe and even square root can get quite difficult. There's no very simple\\nway to just calculate it the way that you might\\nmultiply things or divide it. \",\n",
       " '11.2.5': \"- [Instructor] Let's\\nsee if we can calculate the fifth root of 32. So, like always, pause the\\nvideo and see if you can figure this out on your own. So, let's just remind\\nourselves what a fifth root is. So, if x is equal to the fifth root of 32, that's the same thing as saying x to the fifth power is equal to 32. So, we have to find some number where, if you take five of them\\nand multiply them together, you'd get 32. So, there is a couple of\\nways to approach this. Especially when you're dealing with these really high order roots here. So, let me rewrite the\\nfifth root of 32 here. One way is you could try to factor 32 and see are there factors\\nthat show up five times? So, 32 you might immediately\\nrecognize is an even number. So, it's gonna be divisible by two. It's two times 16. 16 is two times eight. Eight is two times four. Four is two times two. So, in this case, doing the factoring technique worked out well. 'Cause we see that this is two times two times\\ntwo times two times two or two to the fifth power. You could rewrite this as the fifth root of two to the fifth power, which is, of course,\\ngoing to be equal to two. Two to the fifth power is 32. Now, let's do another one. It's gonna be a little bit harder. Let's say we wanna take\\nthe fifth root of 243. So, now, a much, much larger number. So, there's a couple of ways to do this. One, you could try the factoring. Although, that's gonna be harder now that it's a larger number. Or you could do a little\\nbit of trial and error. Doing higher roots without the aid of some type of calculator or something is a little bit more complicated. So, here, if we wanted to\\ndo the factoring technique. We could say, alright,\\nit's not divisible by two. I like to start with the\\nsmallest possible factor. So, it's not divisible by two. Is it divisible by three? And you might be familiar with the test to see if something is divisible by three. You add up the digits and see if that sum of the digits is divisible by three. So, if I were to take\\ntwo plus four plus three, that is equal to nine. And so it is divisible by three. So, this is going to be\\nequal to three times... Let's see three goes into\\n240 80 times and then one. So, 81 times. And so, 81 is also divisible by three. I have a sense of where this is going now. It's three times 27,\\nwhich is three times nine. Which is three times three. So, using the factoring method, we're able to see that three\\nto the fifth power is 243. So, the fifth root of\\n243 is equal to three. Now, another way that\\nyou could have done it is a little bit of trial and error. We already know.. Well, we know that one to the fifth power is just going to be one. We know that two to the fifth power... We just calculated that. That's 32. Well, we now know what\\nthree to the fifth is. Let's say we're just trying to zoom in on it a little bit. So, let's say, if you wanted to see what four to the fifth is. Well, that would be four times four times four times four times four. So, let's see, this is going to be 16. 16 times four is 64. Times four is 256. And then, that times four... And I just happen to know this. But you might wanna do it by hand. This is 1024. So, if you're taking the cube root of 243, you're saying what to the fifth power... Something to the fifth\\npower is equal to 243. And, if you have a sense that it's going to be an integer solution, if you think it's going to be something like a two or a three, well, then, three is probably\\ngoing to be a good guess here. If the possible answers\\nare gonna be decimals, then it's going to be\\na lot more complicated. But that's another way. Say, hey, maybe I'll try a three. And, if you try out\\nthree, you would get 243. \",\n",
       " '11.3.1': \"Let's see if we can simplify 5\\ntimes the square root of 117. So 117 doesn't jump out at me as\\nsome type of a perfect square. So let's actually take\\nits prime factorization and see if any of those prime\\nfactors show up more than once. So clearly it's an odd number. It's clearly not divisible by 2. To test whether\\nit's divisible by 3, we can add up all of the digits. And we explain why this works in\\nanother place on Khan Academy. But if you add up all\\nthe digits, you get a 9. And 9 is divisible by 3, so 117\\nis going to be divisible by 3. Now, let's do a\\nlittle aside here to figure out what 117\\ndivided by 3 actually is. So 3 doesn't go into 1. It does go into 11, three times. 3 times 3 is 9. Subtract, you got\\na remainder of 2. Bring down a 7. 3 goes into 27 nine times. 9 times 3 is 27. Subtract, and you're done. It goes in perfectly. So we can factor\\n117 as 3 times 39. Now 39, we can factor as--\\nthat jumps out more at us that that's divisible by 3. That's equivalent to 3 times 13. And then all of these\\nare now prime numbers. So we could say that this\\nthing is the same as 5 times the square root of\\n3 times 3 times 13. And this is going to be the\\nsame thing as-- and we know this from our exponent\\nproperties-- 5 times the square root of 3 times 3\\ntimes the square root of 13. Now, what's the square\\nroot of 3 times 3? Well, that's the\\nsquare root of 9. That's the square\\nroot of 3 squared. Any of those-- well, that's\\njust going to give you 3. So this is just going\\nto simplify to 3. So this whole thing is 5 times\\n3 times the square root of 13. So this part right over\\nhere would give us 15 times the square root of 13. Let's do one more example here. So let's try to simplify 3\\ntimes the square root of 26. I'm actually going\\nto put 26 in yellow, like I did in the\\nprevious problem. Well, 26 is clearly\\nan even number, so it's going to\\nbe divisible by 2. We can rewrite it as 2 times 13. And then we're done. 13 is a prime number. We can't factor this any more. And so 26 doesn't have\\nany perfect squares in it. It's not like we\\ncan factor it out as a factor of\\nsome other numbers and some perfect squares\\nlike we did here. 117 is 13 times 9. It's the product of a\\nperfect square and 13. 26 isn't, so we've simplified\\nthis about as much as we can. We would just leave this as 3\\ntimes the square root of 26. \",\n",
       " '11.3.2': \"What I want to do in\\nthis video is resimplify this expression, 3 times the\\nprincipal root of 500 times x to the third, and take\\ninto consideration some of the comments that\\nwe got out on YouTube that actually give some\\ninteresting perspective on how you could simplify this. So just as a quick review of\\nwhat we did in the last video, we said that this\\nis the same thing as 3 times the\\nprincipal root of 500. And I'm going to do it a\\nlittle bit different than I did in the last video, just\\nto make it interesting. This is 3 times\\nthe principal root of 500 times the principal\\nroot of x to the third. And 500-- we can\\nrewrite it, because 500 is not a perfect square. We can rewrite 500\\nas 100 times 5. Or even better, we could rewrite\\nthat as 10 squared times 5. 10 squared is the\\nsame thing as 100. So we can rewrite this first\\npart over here as 3 times the principal root\\nof 10 squared times 5 times the principal\\nroot of x squared times x. That's the same thing\\nas x to the third. Now, the one thing I'm\\ngoing to do here-- actually, I won't talk about\\nit just yet, of how we're going to do it\\ndifferently than we did it in the last video. This radical right\\nhere can be rewritten as-- so this is going to\\nbe 3 times the square root, or the principal\\nroot, I should say, of 10 squared times\\nthe square root of 5. If we take the square root\\nof the product of two things, it's the same thing as taking\\nthe square root of each of them and then taking the product. And so then this\\nover here is going to be times the square root\\nof, or the principal root of, x squared times the\\nprincipal root of x. And the principal root\\nof 10 squared is 10. And then what I said\\nin the last video is that the principal\\nroot of x squared is going to be the absolute\\nvalue of x, just in case x itself is a negative number. And so then if you\\nsimplify all of this, you get 3 times\\n10, which is 30-- and I'm just going to\\nswitch the order here-- times the absolute value of x. And then you have\\nthe square root of 5, or the principal root of 5,\\ntimes the principal root of x. And this is just going to be\\nequal to the principal root of 5x. Taking the square\\nroot of something and multiplying that times the\\nsquare root of something else is the same thing as just\\ntaking the square root of 5x. So all of this simplified\\ndown to 30 times the absolute value of x times\\nthe principal root of 5x. And this is what we\\ngot in the last video. And the interesting\\nthing here is, if we assume we're only\\ndealing with real numbers, the domain of x right\\nover here, the x's that will make this\\nexpression defined in the real numbers--\\nthen x has to be greater than or equal to 0. So maybe I could\\nwrite it this way. The domain here is that\\nx is any real number greater than or equal to 0. And the reason\\nwhy I say that is, if you put a negative number\\nin here and you cube it, you're going to get\\nanother negative number. And then at least\\nin the real numbers, you won't get an actual value. You'll get a square root\\nof a negative number here. So if you make this-- if\\nyou assume this right here, we're dealing with\\nthe real numbers. We're not dealing with\\nany complex numbers. When you open it up\\nto complex numbers, then you can expand the\\ndomain more broadly. But if you're dealing\\nwith real numbers, you can say that x is going to\\nbe greater than or equal to 0. And then the absolute\\nvalue of x is just going to be x, because it's not\\ngoing to be a negative number. And so if we're assuming\\nthat the domain of x is-- or if this expression is\\ngoing to be evaluatable, or it's going to have\\na positive number, then this can be written as 30x\\ntimes the square root of 5x. If you had the situation\\nwhere we were dealing with complex\\nnumbers-- and if you don't know what a complex number\\nis, or an imaginary number, don't worry too much about it. But if you were\\ndealing with those, then you would have to keep\\nthe absolute value of x there. Because then this\\nwould be defined for numbers that\\nare less than 0. \",\n",
       " '11.3.3': \"- [Instructor] Let's get some practice. Simplifying radical expressions\\nthat involve variables. So let's say I have two times the square root of seven x times three times the square root of 14 x squared. Pause the video and see\\nif you can simplify it. Taking any perfect squares out multiplying and taking any perfect squares out of the radical sign. Well, let's first just multiply this thing. So, we can change the order of multiplication. This is going to be the same thing as two times three times the square root of seven x times the square root of 14 x squared. And so this is going to be equal to six times and then the product of two radicals, you can view that as the\\nsquare root of the product. So six times the square root of and I'll actually I'll just leave it like this. Seven times x and then let me actually factor 14. 14 is two times seven times x squared. Actually let me extend my radical sign a little bit. And the reason why I\\ndidn't multiply it out. Obviously we could've\\nmultiplied it in our head. X times x squared is x to the third. And we could've said, seven times 14 is what 98. We could've done that. But when you're trying to factor out perfect squares, it's actually easier if it's in this factored form here. Especially because, from a variable point of view you can view this as a\\nperfect square already. And then 14's not a perfect square, seven isn't a perfect square but seven times seven is. Seven times seven is a perfect square. That is 49 of course. So let's rewrite this a little bit to see what we can do. This is going to be six times and I could write it like this. The square root of let's put all the perfect squares first so seven times seven that is 49 that's those two. X squared 49 x squared and then I could once again separate the two\\nradicals right over here. So whatever else is left. So I've already used the seven,\\nthe seven, the x squared I have a two x left. Times two x. Hopefully you'll appreciate\\nthat these two things are equivalent. I could've put one big radical sign over 49 x squared times two x which would've been exactly\\nwhat you have there, but, if you're taking the\\nradical of the product of things, that's the same thing as the product of the radicals. It's come straight out of\\nour exponent properties. But what's valuable about this is we now see this is six times now we can take the the square root of 49 x squared this is going to seven x square root of 49 is seven square root of x squared is going to be x and then we multiply that times the square root of two x times the square root of two x and so now we're in the home stretch. Six times seven is 42 x times the square root of two x and the key thing to appreciate is I keep using this property that a radical of products or the square root of products is the same thing as a\\nproduct of the square root. So even this step that I did here, if you wanted, you could've\\nhad an intermediary step. You could've said that the\\nsquare root of 49 x squared is the same thing as square root of 49 times the square root of x squared which would get us square\\nroot of 49 is seven square root of x squared is x right over there. Let's do let's do another one of these. So let's say I have square root of two a times the square root of 14 a to the third times the square root of five a. So like always, pause this video and see if you can\\nsimplify this on your own. Multiply them and then take\\nall the perfect squares out of the radical. So let's multiply first. So this is gonna be the same thing as the square root of two times 14 times five. So let me actually just I'm just going to two and five are prime. 14 I can factor it as two times seven so this is gonna be two times, instead of\\n14 I'm going to write two times seven and then times five and then we have a times a to the third times a well actually let me write that as a to the fifth. We have a to the first,\\ntimes a to the third, times a to the first, and the exponents you get a to the fifth. Now, what perfect squares do we have here? Well we already see a perfect square in terms of two times two and then a to the fifth\\nisn't a perfect square if you think of terms of the variable a but you can view that as a\\nperfect square a to the fourth times a. So let's rearrange this a little bit. And so this is going to be equal to the square root of let me put my perfect squares out front. The square root of four, two times two times a to the fourth and then let me put my non perfect squares times I have a seven a five and an a that I haven't used yet so seven times five is 35 so it's 35 a and now just like we said before, we could let me do it we could say hey look, this is the same thing as\\nthe square root of four times the square root of a to the fourth it's using exponent properties and then times the square root of 35 a. Now principle root of\\nfour is positive two. You can view this as\\na positive square root and then square root of a to the fourth the principle root is\\ngoing to be a squared and then we're going to have that times the square root of 35 a and we're done. Let's do one more example and this time, we're going\\nto involve two variables which as we'll see isn't that much more complicating. So let's simplify the square root of 72 x to the third z to the third so the key is can we factor 72 is not a perfect square but is there a perfect\\nsquare somewhere in there? And you immediately see that\\nif you're trying to factor it you get 36 times two and 36 of course is a perfect square. And likewise x to the\\nthird and z to the third are not each perfect squares but they each have an x\\nsquared and z squared in them. So let me rewrite this. This is the same thing This is the same thing as I can write let me put all my\\nperfect squares up front. So I have 36 36 I'm gonna take an x squared out x squared I'm gonna take a z squared out z squared and then we're left with is we took a 36 out so we're left with a two times two and if we took an x squared out of this we're left with just an x x to the third divided by x squared is x two x and then z to the third\\ndivided by z squared is just z and you can verify this multiply this all out. You should be getting you should be getting\\nexactly what we have here. I do that little line on\\nthe z to differentiate so it doesn't look like my twos. 36 times two is 72 x squared times x is x to the third. Z squared times z is z to the third. But now this is pretty\\nstraighforward to factor because let me just I'll do more steps than\\nyou would probably do if you were doing it on your own but that's because the whole point here is to learn. So two x z so that's just using exponent properties. And so everything here\\nis a perfect square. This is going to be the square root of 36 times the square root of x squared times the square root of z squared which is going to be square root of 36 is principle root of 36 is six principle root of x squared is x principle root of z squared is z and we're gonna multiply that times square root of two x z and we are done. \",\n",
       " '12.1.1': \"In this video, I want to\\nintroduce you to the idea of an exponential function and\\nreally just show you how fast these things can grow. So let's just write an example\\nexponential function here. So let's say we have y is equal\\nto 3 to the x power. Notice, this isn't x to\\nthe third power, this is 3 to the x power. Our independent variable x\\nis the actual exponent. So let's make a table here to\\nsee how quickly this thing grows, and maybe we'll\\ngraph it as well. So let's take some\\nx values here. Let's start with x is\\nequal to negative 4. Then we'll go to negative 3,\\nnegative 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. And let's figure out what our\\ny-values are going to be for each of these x-values. Now, here, y is going to be 3 to\\nthe negative 4 power, which is equal to 1 over 3 to\\nthe fourth power. 3 to the third is 27 times\\n3 again is 81. So this is equal to 1/81. When x is equal to negative\\n3, y is 3. We'll do this in a\\ndifferent color. This color is hard to read. y is 3 to the negative\\n3 power. Well, that's 1 over 3\\nto the third power, which is equal to 1/27. So we're going from a\\nsuper-small number to a less super-small number. And then 3 to the negative\\n2 power is going to be 1/9, right? 1 over 3 squared, and then we\\nhave 3 to the 0 power, which is just equal to 1. So we're getting a little bit\\nlarger, a little bit larger, but you'll see that we\\nare about to explode. Now, we have 3 to\\nthe first power. That's equal to 3. So we have 3 to the second\\npower, right? y is equal to 3 to the second power. That's 9. 3 to the third power, 27. 3 to the fourth power, 81. If we were to put the\\nfifth power, 243. Let's graph this, just\\nto get an idea of how quickly we're exploding. Let me draw my axes here. So that's my x-axis and\\nthat is my y-axis. And let me just do it in\\nincrements of 5, because I really want to get the general\\nshape of the graph here. So let me just draw as straight\\na line as I can. Let's say this is 5, 10, 15. Actually, I won't get\\nto 81 that way. I want to get to 81. Well, that's good enough. Let me draw it a little\\nbit differently than I've drawn it. So let me draw it down here\\nbecause all of these values, you might notice, are positive\\nvalues because I have a positive base. So let me draw it like this. Good enough. And then let's say I have 10,\\n20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. That is 80 right there. That's 10. That's 30. That'll be good for\\napproximation. And then let's say that\\nthis is negative 5. This is positive 5 right here. And actually, let me stretch\\nit out a little bit more. Let's say this is negative 1,\\nnegative 2, negative 3, negative 4. Then we have 1, 2, 3, and 4. So when x is equal to 0, we're\\nequal to 1, right? When x is equal to 0, y is equal\\nto 1, which is right around there. When x is equal to 1, y is equal\\nto 3, which is right around there. When x is equal to 2, y is equal\\nto 9, which is right around there. When x equal to 3, y is\\nequal to 27, which is right around there. When x is equal to 4,\\ny is equal to 81. You see very quickly this\\nis just exploding. If I did 5, we'd go to\\n243, which wouldn't even fit on my screen. When you go to negative 1, we\\nget smaller and smaller. So at negative 1,\\nwe're at 1/9. Eventually, you're not even\\ngoing to see this. It's going to get closer\\nand closer to zero. As this approaches larger and\\nlarger negative numbers, or I guess I should say smaller\\nnegative numbers, so 3 to the negative thousand, 3 to the\\nnegative million, we're getting numbers closer and\\ncloser to zero without actually ever approaching\\nzero. So as we go from negative\\ninfinity, x is equal to negative infinity, we're getting\\nvery close to zero, we're slowly getting our\\nway ourselves away from zero, but then bam! Once we start getting\\ninto the positive numbers, we just explode. We just explode, and we\\nkeep exploding at an ever-increasing rate. So the idea here is just to\\nshow you that exponential functions are really,\\nreally dramatic. Well, you can always construct\\na faster expanding function. For example, you could say y is\\nequal to x to the x, even faster expanding, but out of the\\nones that we deal with in everyday life, this is one of\\nthe fastest. So given that, let's do some word problems\\nthat just give us an appreciation for exponential\\nfunctions. So let's say that someone\\nsends out a chain letter in week 1. In week 1, someone sent a chain\\nletter to 10 people. And the chain letter says you\\nhave to now send this chain letter to 10 more new people,\\nand if you don't, you're going to have bad luck, and your hair\\nis going to fall out, and you'll marry a frog,\\nor whatever else. So all of these people agree and\\nthey go and each send it to 10 people the next week. So in week 2, they go\\nout and each send it to 10 more people. So each of those original 10\\npeople are each sending out 10 more of the letters. So now 100 people have\\nthe letters, right? Each of those 10 sent\\nout 10, so that 100 letters were sent out. 10 were sent. Here, 100 were sent. In week 3, what's\\ngoing to happen? Each of those 100 people who\\ngot this one, they're each going to send out 10, assuming\\nthat everyone is really into chain letters. So 1,000 people are\\ngoing to get it. And so the general pattern\\nhere is, the people who receive it, so in week n where\\nn is the week we're talking about, how many people\\nreceived the letter? In week n, we have 10 to the nth\\npeople receive-- i before e except after c-- the letter. So if I were to ask you, how\\nmany people are getting the letter on the sixth week? How many people are actually\\ngoing to receive that letter? Well, what's 10 to\\nthe sixth power? 10 to the sixth is equal to 1\\nwith six zeroes, which is 1 million people are going to\\nreceive that letter in just 6 weeks, just sending out\\n10 letters each. And obviously, in the real\\nworld, most people chuck these in the basket, so you don't have\\nthis good of a hit rate. But if you did, if every 10\\npeople you sent it to also sent it to 10 people and so on\\nand so forth, by the sixth week, you would have\\na million people. And by the ninth week, you would\\nhave a billion people. And frankly, the week\\nafter that, you would run out of people. I'll see you in the\\nnext video. \",\n",
       " '12.1.2': \"- [Instructor] So I have two\\ndifferent xy relationships being described here. And what I would like to do in this video is figure out whether each\\nof these relationships, whether they are either\\nlinear relationships, exponential relationships, or neither. And like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out yourself. So let's look at this first\\nrelationship right over here. And the key way to tell whether\\nwe're dealing with a linear, or exponential, or neither relationship, is think about, okay,\\nfor given change in x, and you see, each time here, we are increasing x by the same amount. So we're increasing x by three. So given that we're increasing\\nx by a constant amount, by three each time, does y\\nincrease by a constant amount? In which case, we would be dealing with a linear relationship. Or is there a constant ratio\\nbetween successive terms when you increase x by a constant amount. In which case, we would be dealing with an exponential relationship. So let's see. Here we're going from\\nnegative two to five. So we are adding seven. When x increases by three,\\ny increases by seven. When x is increasing by three,\\ny increases by seven again. When x increases by three,\\ny increases by seven again. So here, it is clearly\\na linear relationship. Linear relationship. In fact, you can even, relationship, you could even plot this on a line if you assume that these\\nare samples on a line. You could think even about\\nthe slope of that line. For a change in x, for\\na given change in x, the change in y is always constant. When our change in x is three, our change in y is always seven. So this is clearly a linear relationship. Now let's look at this one. Let's see. Looks like our x's are\\nchanging by one each time, so plus one. Now what are y's changing by? Here it changes by two. Then it changes by six. Alright, it's clearly not linear. Then it changes by 18. Clearly not a linear relationship. If this was linear, these\\nwould be the same amount, same delta, same change\\nin y for every time, 'cause we have the same change in x. So let's test to see if it's exponential. If it's an exponential, for each of these constant changes in x's, when we increase x by one every time, our ratio of successive\\ny's should be the same. Or another way to think about it is what are we multiplying y by? So to go from one to three, you multiply, you multiply by three. To go from three to nine,\\nyou multiply be three. To go from nine to 27,\\nyou multiply by three. So in a situation where every time you increase x by a fixed\\namount, in this case one, and the corresponding y's get multiplied by some fixed amount, then you're dealing with an\\nexponential relationship. Exponential. Exponential relationship right over here. \",\n",
       " '12.1.3': \"Voiceover:A newborn calf\\nweighs 40 kilograms. Each week its weight increases by 5%. Let W be the weight in\\nkilograms of the calf after t weeks. Is W a linear function or\\nan exponential function? So, if W were a linear\\nfunction, that means that every week that goes by, the weight would increase by the same amount. So let's say that every week that went by, the weight increases ... Or, really, they're\\ntalking about mass here. The mass increased by 5 kilograms. Then we'd be dealing\\nwith a linear function. But they're not saying that the weight increases by 5 kilograms. They're saying by 5%. After one week it'll be\\n1.05 times 40 kilograms. After another week it'll\\nbe 1.05 times that, it'll be 5 percent more. After the next week\\nit'll be 1.05 times that. So really, if we really\\nthink about this function, it's going to be 40 kilograms times 1.05 to the t power. We're compounding by 5% every time. We're increasing by a factor of 1.05. Or another way of thinking\\nabout it, by a factor of 105% every week. Because we have that growth by a factor, not just by a constant\\nnumber, that tells us that this is going to be\\nan exponential function. So let's see which if these\\nchoices describe that. This function is linear, no, we don't have to even read that. This function is linear, nope. This function is exponential\\nbecause W increases by a factor of 5 each\\ntime t increases by 1. No, that's not right. We're increasing by 5%. Increasing by 5% means\\nyou're 1.05 times as big as you were before increasing. So it's really this\\nfunction is exponential because W increases by a factor of 1.05 each time t increases by 1. That, right over there,\\nis the right answer. Let's try 1 more of these. Determine whether the quantity described is changing in a linear fashion or an exponential fashion. Fidel has a rare coin worth $550. Each year the coin's\\nvalue increases by 10%. Well, this is just like the last example we saw. We're increasing every year that goes by as we increase by a factor of 1.1. If we grow by 10%, that's\\nincreasing by a factor of 110% or 1.1. So this is definitely exponential. If it was increasing $10 per year, then it would be linear. But here we're increasing by a percentage. Your uncle bought a car\\nfor 130,000 Mexican pesos. Each year the value of the car decreases by 10,000 pesos. So here we're not multiplying by a factor, we're decreasing by a fixed amount. 1 year goes by, we're at 120,000. 2 years goes by we're at 110,000. So this is definitely a linear ... This can be described by a linear model. The number of wild hogs\\nin Arkansas increases by a factor of 3 every 5 years. So a factor of 3 every 5 years. They're not saying it increases by 3 hogs every 5 years. We're multiplying by 3 every 5 years. So this is definitely ... This one right over here\\nis going to be exponential. Then, finally, you work as\\na waiter at a restaurant. You earn $50 in tips every day you work. Well, this is super ... This should jump out as very linear. Every day you work, another $50. Work 1 day, $50. 2 days, $100. So forth and so on. They're not saying that\\nyou earned 50 times as much as the day before. They're not saying that\\nyou earned 50% more. They're saying that you're increasing by a fixed quantity. So this is going to be a linear model. \",\n",
       " '12.1.4': '- [Instructor] The table\\nrepresents the cost of buying a small piece of land in a remote village since the year 1990. Which kind of function best\\nmodels this relationship? And I\\'m using, this is an example from\\nthe Khan Academy exercises, and we\\'re really trying to pick between whether a linear model or a linear function\\nmodels this relationship or an exponential model or exponential function will model this relationship. So like always, pause this video, and see if you can figure\\nit out on your own. All right, so now let\\'s\\nthink about this together. So as the time goes by around this, the time variable right over here, we see that we keep\\nincrementing it by two. Go from zero to two, two to four, four to six, so on and so forth. It keeps going up by two. So if this is a linear relationship, given that our change in time is constant, our change in cost should\\nincrease by a constant amount. Doesn\\'t have to be this constant, but it has to be a constant amount. If we were dealing with an\\nexponential relationship, we would multiply by the same amount for a constant change in time. Let\\'s see what\\'s going on here. Let\\'s just first look at the difference between these numbers. To go from 30 to 36.9, you would have to add 6.9. And to go from 36.9 to 44.1, what do you have to add? You have to add 7.2. And now to go from 44.1 to 51.1, you would have to add seven. Now to go to 51.1 to 57.9, you are adding 6.8, 6.8. And then finally, going from 57.9 to 65.1, let\\'s see, this is almost eight, 7.1, this is what, 7.2 we\\'re adding, plus 7.2. So you might say, \"Hey, wait, \"we\\'re not adding the exact\\nsame amount every time.\" But remember, this is intended to be data that you might actually get\\nfrom a real-world situation. And the data that you get\\nfrom a real-world situation will never be exactly a linear model or exactly an exponential model. But every time we add two years, it does look like we\\'re\\ngetting pretty close to adding 7,000 dollars in cost. 6.9 is pretty close to seven. That\\'s pretty close to seven. That is seven. This is pretty close to seven. That\\'s pretty close to seven. So this is looking like\\na linear model to me. You could test whether\\nit\\'s an exponential model. You see, well, what factor\\nam I multiplying each time? But that doesn\\'t seem to be as, this doesn\\'t seem to be\\ngrowing exponentially. It doesn\\'t seem like we\\'re multiplying by the same factor every time. It seems like we\\'re multiplying\\nby a slightly lower factor, as we get to higher cost. So the linear model seems\\nto be a pretty good thing. If I see every time I\\nincrease by two years, I\\'m increasing cost by\\n6.9 or 7.2 or seven. It\\'s pretty close to seven. So it\\'s not exactly the cost, but the model predicts it pretty well. If you were to plot these on a, on a coordinate plane and try to connect the dots, it would look pretty close to a line, or you could draw a line\\nthat gets pretty close to those dots. ',\n",
       " '12.2.1': '- [Instructor] You put\\n$3,800 in a savings account. The bank will provide\\n1.8% interest on the money in the account every year. Another way of saying that, the money in the savings account\\nwill grow by 1.8% per year. Write an expression that\\ndescribes how much money will be in the account in 15 years. So let\\'s just think\\nabout this a little bit. Let\\'s just think about\\nthe starting amount. So in the start, we\\'re\\njust gonna put $3,800. We could view that as year zero. Actually, let me write it that way. So the start is the\\nsame thing as year zero and we\\'re gonna start with $3,800. Now let\\'s think about year one. How much money will we\\nhave after one year? Well, we would have the original\\namount that we put, $3,800, and then we\\'re gonna get the\\namount that we get an interest and they say that the bank\\nwill provide 1.8% interest on the money in the account so it\\'ll be plus 1.8% times $3,800 and we could also write this as a decimal. This is equal to 3,800\\nplus and I\\'ll just write, I\\'ll switch the order\\nof multiplication here, plus 3,800 times 0.018. 1.8% is the same thing\\nas 18,000ths or 1.800ths depending on how you want to pronounce it. And so here you might say, \"Well, there\\'s an interesting\\npotential simplification \"mathematically here.\" I could factor 3,800 out\\nof each of these terms. I have a 3,800 here, I have a 3,800 here so why don\\'t I factor it out? Essentially undistributed. So this is going to be 3,800 times, when you factor it out here, you get a one plus, when you factor it out here, you get 0.018 and so I could just rewrite\\nthis as 3,800 times 1.018. So this is an interesting time to pause. We\\'re not at the full answer yet, how much will we have in 15 years, but we have an interesting expression for how much we have after one year. Notice that if the\\nmoney is growing by 1.8% or another way it was growing by 0.018, that\\'s equivalent to multiplying the amount that we started the year with by one plus the amount that\\nit\\'s growing by or 1.018. And once again, why does\\nthis make intuitive sense? Because at the end of the year, you\\'re going to have the\\noriginal amount that you put, that\\'s what that one really represents, and then plus you\\'re gonna have\\nthe amount that you grew by so you multiply both the sum here times the original amount you put and that\\'s how much you\\'ll\\nhave at the end of year one. What about year two? So year two. Well, we know what we\\'re going\\nto start with in year two. We\\'re gonna start with whatever\\nwe finished year one with. So we\\'re gonna start\\nwith 3,800 times 1.018, but then it\\'s gonna grow\\nby 1.8% or grow by 0.018. And we already said, if you\\'re\\ngonna grow by that amount, that\\'s equivalent to\\nmultiplying it by 1.018. Well, this is the same\\nthing as 3,800 times 1.018 to the second power. I think you see where this is going. Every time we grow by 1.8%, we\\'re gonna multiply by 1.018. And if we\\'re thinking about\\n15 years in the future, we\\'re gonna do that 15 times. So one year in the future, your exponent here is essentially one. Two years, your exponent is two. So year 15, I can just\\ncut to the chase here, so year 15, well that\\'s just going to be, we\\'re going to have the\\noriginal amount that we invested and we are going to grow 1.018 15 times so we\\'re gonna multiply\\nby this amount 15 times to get the final amount. And one of the fun things, this is actually called compound growth where every year you\\ngrow on top of the amount that you had before. You\\'ll see if you type\\nthis into a calculator that even though 1.8% per\\nyear does not seem like a lot, over 15 years it actually would amount to a reasonable amount, but this is the expression. They\\'re not asking us to calculate it. They just want us to know\\nan expression that describes how much money will be in\\nthe account in 15 years. ',\n",
       " '12.2.2': \"- [Voiceover] So let's\\nthink about a function. I'll just give an example. Let's say, h of n is equal to one-fourth times two to the n. So, first of all, you might notice something\\ninteresting here. We have the variable, the\\ninput into our function. It's in the exponent. And a function like this is\\ncalled an exponential function. So this is an exponential. Ex-po-nen-tial. Exponential function, and that's because the variable, the input into our function, is sitting in its definition of what is the output of\\nthat function going to be. The input is in the exponent. I could write another\\nexponential function. I could write, f of, let's say the input is a variable, t, is equal to is equal to five times times three to the t. Once again, this is an exponential function. Now there's a couple of\\ninteresting things to think about in exponential function. In fact, we'll explore many of them, but I'll get a little\\nused to the terminology, so one thing that you might see is a notion of an initial value. In-i-tial Intitial value. And this is essentially\\nthe value of the function when the input is zero. So, for in these cases, the initial value for the function, h, is going to be, h of zero. And when we evaluate that, that's going to be one-fourth times two to the zero. Well, two to the zero power, is just one. So it's equal to one-fourth. So the initial value,\\nat least in this case, it seems to just be that number that sits out here. We have the initial value times some number to this exponent. And we'll come up with\\nthe name for this number. Well let's see if this was\\ntrue over here for, f of t. So, if we look at its intial value, f of zero is going to be five times three to the zero power and, the same thing again. Three to the zero is just one. Five times one is just five. So the initial value is once again, that. So if you have exponential functions of\\nthis form, it makes sense. Your initial value, well if you put a zero\\nin for the exponent, then the number raised to the exponent is just going to be one, and you're just going to be left with that thing that you're\\nmultiplying by that. Hopefully that makes sense, but since you're looking at it, hopefully it does make a little bit. Now, you might be saying, well what do we call this number? What do we call that number there? Or that number there? And that's called the common ratio. The common common ratio. And in my brain, we say well why is it\\ncalled a common ratio? Well, if you thought about\\ninteger inputs into this, especially sequential\\ninteger inputs into it, you would see a pattern. For example, h of, let me do this in that green color, h of zero is equal to, we already\\nestablished one-fourth. Now, what is h of one going to be equal to? It's going to be one-fourth times two to the first power. So it's going to be one-fourth times two. What is h of two going to be equal to? Well, it's going to be one-fourth times two squared, so it's going to be times two times two. Or, we could just view this as this is going to be two times h of one. And actually I should have done this when I wrote this one out, but this we can write as two times h of zero. So notice, if we were to\\ntake the ratio between h of two and h of one, it would be two. If we were to take the ratio between h of one and h of zero, it would be two. That is the common ratio between successive whole number\\ninputs into our function. So, h of I could say h of n plus one over h of n is going to be equal to is going to be equal to actually I can work it out mathematically. One-fourth times two to the n plus one over one-fourth times two to the n. That cancels. Two to the n plus one,\\ndivided by two to the n is just going to be equal to two. That is your common ratio. So for the function h. For the function f, our common ratio is three. If we were to go the other way around, if someone said, hey, I have some function whose initial value, so let's say, I have some function, I'll\\ndo this in a new color, I have some function, g, and we know that its initial initial value is five. And someone were to say its common ratio its common ratio is six, what would this exponential\\nfunction look like? And they're telling you this\\nis an exponential function. Well, g of let's say x is the input, is going to be equal to our initial value, which is five. That's not a negative sign there, Our initial value is five. I'll write equals to make that clear. And then times our common ratio to the x power. So once again, initial value, right over\\nthere, that's the five. And then our common ratio is the six, right over there. So hopefully that gets\\nyou a little bit familiar with some of the parts of an exponential function, why they are called what they are called. \",\n",
       " '12.2.3': \"- [Instructor] There are\\n170 deer on a reservation. The deer population is increasing at a rate of 30% per year. Write a function that gives\\nthe deer population P of t on the reservation t years from now. All right, let's think about this. And like always, pause this video, and see if you can work\\nit out on your own. Well, let's think about what P of zero is. P of zero, this is going to be the initial population of deer, the population at time zero. Well, we know that, that's\\ngoing to be the 170 deer that we start on the reservation. Now, let's think about what P of one is. What's going to be the\\npopulation after one year? Well, it's going to be our\\noriginal population, 170, but then it increases at\\na rate of 30% per year. So it's going to be 170\\nplus another 30% of 170. So I could write that as 30% times 170. Or I could write this as 170 plus 0.3 times 170. 30% as a decimal is the same\\nthing as 30/100 or 3/10. Or I could write this as, if I factor out 170, I would get 170 times one plus 0.3, which is the same thing as 170 times 1.03. And this is a really good\\nthing to take a hard look at 'cause you'll see it a lot when we're growing by a certain rate, when we're dealing with what turns out to be\\nexponential functions. If we are growing, well, I almost made a\\nmistake there, it's 1.3. So here you go, 1.3. One plus 0.3 is 1.3. So once again, take a hard\\nlook at this right over here because it's going to be something that you see a lot with\\nexponential functions. When you grow by 30%, that means you keep your\\n100% that you had before, and then you add another 30%. And so you would multiply your\\noriginal quantity by 130%, and 130% is the same thing as 1.3. So if you are growing by 30%, you are growing by 3/10, you would multiply your\\ninitial quantity by 1.3. So let's use that idea to keep going. So what is the population after two years? Well, you would start that second year with the population at\\nthe end of one year. So it's going to be that 170 times 1.3. And then, over that year,\\nyou're going to grow by another 30%. So if you're gonna grow by another 30%, that's equivalent to\\nmultiplying by 1.3 again. Or you could say that this\\nis equal to 170 times 1.3 to the second power. And so I think you see\\nwhere this is going. If we wanted to write a general P of t, so if we just want to\\nwrite a general P of t, it's going to be whatever\\nwe started with, 170, and we're going to multiply that by 1.3 however many times, however\\nmany years have gone by. So to the t power because, for every year, we grow by 30%, which is equivalent mathematically\\nto multiplying by 1.3. So after 100 years, it would be 170 times\\n1.3 to the 100th power. \",\n",
       " '12.2.4': \"- [Instructor] The expression\\nfive times two to the T gives the number of leaves in a plant as a function of the number\\nof weeks since it was planted. What does two represent\\nin this expression? So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure it out on your own. All right, so let's look at\\nthe expression right over here. We could write it as defining a function. So we could say leaves\\nas a function of time is equal to five times two to the T power and so we could try this out a little bit. If we say well what is L of zero? That would be T equals zero. That's when we are at zero\\nweeks after it was planted. So this is right when it was planted. Well that's five times two to the zero, which is just two to the zero's just one. So it's equal to five and so when you see an\\nexponential expression or an exponential function like this, that is why this number out here is often referred to\\nas your initial value. Initial. Initial value. And so let's explore\\nthis a little bit more. What is L of one? What happens after one week? Well that's gonna be five\\ntimes two to the first power or five times two. So going from when it was\\nplanted to the first week, we are multiplying by two. The number of leaves doubles. Well what happens after two weeks, the number of leaves after two weeks? Well that's gonna be five\\ntimes two to the second power. Well that's the number that\\nyou had in the first week times two. So it looks like every\\nweek we are doubling, we are multiplying by two and that's why this\\nnumber right over here, which is what the question\\nis about, the two, this is often referred\\nto as the common ratio. Common ratio. Because between any two successive weeks, the ratio between say week\\ntwo and week one is two. Week two is double week one. Week one is double week zero. So let's see which of these choices actually match up to that. There were initially\\ntwo leaves in the plant. Well we know that there weren't\\ntwo leaves on the plant. Our initial value was five. So let me cross that one out. The number of leaves is\\nmultiplied by two each week. Well that's exactly\\nwhat we just described. So I like that choice. Let's look at the last\\none just for good measure. The plant was planted two weeks ago. Well no, they don't tell\\nus anything about that. This is a general expression for T weeks after it was planted. So they're not saying when\\nit was actually planted. So we could rule that out and we feel good about that second choice. \",\n",
       " '12.3.1': \"We're asked to graph y is\\nequal to 5 to the x-th power. And we'll just do this\\nthe most basic way. We'll just try out\\nsome values for x and see what we get for y. And then we'll plot\\nthose coordinates. So let's try some negative\\nand some positive values. And I'll try to\\ncenter them around 0. So this will be my x values. This will be my y values. Let's start first with something\\nreasonably negative but not too negative. So let's say we start with\\nx is equal to negative 2. Then y is equal to\\n5 to the x power, or 5 to the negative\\n2 power, which we know is the same thing as 1 over 5\\nto the positive 2 power, which is just 1/25. Now let's try another value. What happens when x is\\nequal to negative 1? Then y is 5 to the\\nnegative 1 power, which is the same thing as 1 over 5\\nto the first power, or just 1/5. Now let's think about\\nwhen x is equal to 0. Then y is going to be equal\\nto 5 to the 0-th power, which we know anything\\nto the 0-th power is going to be equal to 1. So this is going\\nto be equal to 1. And then finally,\\nwe have-- well, actually, let's try a\\ncouple of more points here. Let me extend this table\\na little bit further. Let's try out x is equal to 1. Then y is 5 to the first power,\\nwhich is just equal to 5. And let's do one\\nlast value over here. Let's see what happens\\nwhen x is equal to 2. Then y is 5 squared,\\n5 to the second power, which is just equal to 25. And now we can plot it to\\nsee how this actually looks. So let me get some\\ngraph paper going here. My x's go as low as negative\\n2, as high as positive 2. And then my y's go all the way\\nfrom 1/25 all the way to 25. So I have positive\\nvalues over here. So let me draw it like this. So this could be my x-axis. That could be my x-axis. And then let's make\\nthis my y-axis. I'll draw it as neatly as I can. So let's make that my y-axis. And my x values, this\\ncould be negative 2. Actually, make my\\ny-axis keep going. So that's y. This is x. That's a negative 2. That's negative 1. That's 0. That is 1. And that is positive 2. And let's plot the points. x is negative 2. y is 1/25. Actually, let me make\\nthe scale on the y-axis. So let's make this. So we're going to go\\nall the way to 25. So let's say that this is 5. Actually, I have to do it a\\nlittle bit smaller than that, too. So this is going to\\nbe 5, 10, 15, 20. And then 25 would be right where\\nI wrote the y, give or take. So now let's plot them. Negative 2, 1/25. 1 is going to be like there. So 1/25 is going to be really,\\nreally close to the x-axis. That's about 1/25. So that is negative 2, 1/25. It's not going to\\nbe on the x-axis. 1/25 is obviously\\ngreater than 0. It's going to be really,\\nreally, really, really, close. Now let's do this point here\\nin orange, negative 1, 1/5. Negative 1/5-- 1/5 on this\\nscale is still pretty close. It's pretty close. So that right over there\\nis negative 1, 1/5. And now in blue,\\nwe have 0 comma 1. 0 comma 1 is going to\\nbe right about there. If this is 2 and 1/2, that\\nlooks about right for 1. And then we have 1 comma 5. 1 comma 5 puts us\\nright over there. And then finally,\\nwe have 2 comma 25. When x is 2, y is 25. 2 comma 25 puts us\\nright about there. And so I think you see what\\nhappens with this function, with this graph. The further in the\\nnegative direction we go, 5 to ever-increasing\\nnegative powers gets closer and closer\\nto 0, but never quite. So we're leaving 0, getting\\nslightly further, further, further from 0. Right at the y-axis,\\nwe have y equal 1. Right at x is equal to 0,\\nwe have y is equal to 1. And then once x starts\\nincreasing beyond 0, then we start seeing what\\nthe exponential is good at, which is just this\\nvery rapid increase. Some people would call it\\nan exponential increase, which is obviously the\\ncase right over here. So then if I just\\nkeep this curve going, you see it's just going\\non this sometimes called a hockey stick. It just keeps on\\ngoing up like this at a super fast rate,\\never-increasing rate. So you could keep going\\nforever to the left, and you'd get closer and\\ncloser and closer to 0 without quite getting to 0. So 5 to the negative\\nbillionth power is still not going\\nto get you to 0, but it's going to get you\\npretty darn close to 0. But obviously, if you go to 5\\nto the positive billionth power, you're going to get\\nto a super huge number because this thing is just\\ngoing to keep skyrocketing up like that. So let me just draw\\nthe whole curve, just to make sure you see it. Over here, I'm not actually on\\n0, although the way I drew it, it might look like that. I'm slightly above 0. I'm increasing above that,\\nincreasing above that. And once I get into the\\npositive x's, then I start really,\\nreally shooting up. \",\n",
       " '12.3.2': \"- [Instructor] Alright,\\nwe are asked to choose the graph of the function. And the function is f(x) is equal to two, times three to the x and we have three choices here. So, pause this video and\\nsee if you can determine which of these three graphs actually is the graph of f(x). Let's work through this together. So, whenever I have a function like this, which is an exponential function, because I'm taking some number and I'm multiplying it by some\\nother number to some power. So, that tells me that I'm\\ndealing with an exponential. So, I like to think about two things. What happens when x equals zero? What is the value of our function? Well, when you just look at this function, this would be two,\\ntimes three to the zero. Which is equal to, three\\nto the zero is one. It's equal to two. So, one way to think about it. In the graph of y is equal to f(x), when x is equal to\\nzero, y is equal to two. Or another way to think about it is this value in exponential function, sometimes called the initial value, if you were thinking of the x-axis. Instead of the x-axis, you're\\nthinking about the time axis or the t-axis. That's why it's sometimes\\ncalled the initial value. But the y-intercept is\\ngonna be described by that when you have a function of this form. And you saw it right over there, f(0). Three to the zero's one. You're just left with the two. So, which of these have\\na y-intercept of two? Well, here, the\\ny-intercept looks like one. Here, the y-intercept looks like three. Here, the y-intercept is two. So, just through elimination\\nthrough that alone, we can feel pretty good that this third graph is probably the choice. But let's keep on analyzing it to feel even better about it. And so, we have the skills for really any exponential function\\nthat we might run into. Well, the other thing to realize. This number, three, is often referred to as a common ratio. And that's because every\\ntime you increase x by one, you're gonna be taking\\nthree to a one higher power. Or you're essentially gonna\\nbe multiplying by three again. So, for example, f(1) is going to be equal to two, times three to the one. Two, times three to the\\none or two times three, which is equal to six. So, from f(0) to f(1), you essentially have to multiply by three. And you keep multiplying by three. f(2) you're gonna multiply by three again. It's gonna be two, times three squared, which is equal to 18. And so, once again, when\\nI increased my x by one, I'm multiplying the value\\nof my function by three. So, let's just see which of these do this. This one we said has\\nthe wrong y-intercept, but, as we go from x equals\\nzero to x equals one, we are going from one to three. And then, we are going from three till looks like pretty close to nine. So, it does look like this does have a common ratio of three. It just does have a different y-intercept than the function we care about. This looks like the graph f(x) is equal to just\\none, times 3 to the x. Here, we're starting at three. And then, when x equals one, it looks like we are doubling\\nevery time x increases by one. So, this looks like the\\ngraph of y is equal to... I have what we could\\ncall our initial value, our y-intercept, three. And, if we're doubling every\\ntime, we increase by one. Three, times two to the x. That's this graph here. As I said, this first graph looks like y is equal to one, times three to the x. We are tripling every time. One, times three to the x. Or we could just say y is\\nequal to three to the x. Now, this one here better work, 'cause we already picked\\nit as our solution. So, let's see if that's actually the case. So, as we increase by one,\\nwe should multiply by three. So, two times three is, indeed, six. And then, when you\\nincrease by another one, we should go to 18. And that's kind of off the charts here, but it does seem reasonable to see that we are multiplying by three every time. And you could also go the other way. If you're going down by one, you should be dividing by three. So, two divided by three, this does look pretty close to 2/3. So, we should feel very\\ngood about our third choice. \",\n",
       " '12.4.1': \"- [Instructor] Company\\nA is offering $10,000 for the first month and\\nwill increase the amount each month by $5,000. Company B is offering\\n$500 for the first month and will double their payment each month. For which monthly payment\\nwill Company B's payment first exceed Company A's payment? So pause this video and\\ntry to work that out. All right, let's work this out together. So let me set up a little bit of a table. So this is going to be, the first column I'm gonna have is month. The first column is month. The second column is how much\\nCompany A is going to pay. And then third column,\\nlet's think about how much Company B is going to pay. Well, they tell us a few things. They say Company A is offering\\n$10,000 for the first month. So in month one, Company\\nA is offering $10,000, we'll assume, well, I'll\\njust write the dollars there. And then Company B is offering\\n$500 for the first month. $500 for the first month. But then they tell us\\nCompany A is offering, will increase the amount,\\neach month by $5,000. So month two will be 5,000\\nmore, we'll get to $15,000. Month three we'll get to $20,000. Four, we'll get to $25,000. Five, I think you get the\\npoint, we'll get to $30,000. Six, we'll get to $35,000. Seven, we'll get to $40,000. Let me scroll down a little bit. Month eight, I'll stop there. Month eight, we will get to $45,000. Let me extend these lines a little bit. Now let's think about what's\\ngonna happen with Company B. Company B is offering\\n500 for the first month, but will double their payment each month. So the second month is\\ngonna be double that. So that's going to be $1,000. Then we're gonna double\\nthat again, $2,000. Then we're gonna double\\nthat again, $4,000. Double that again, $16,000. Double that again, $32,000. Double that, oh, I skipped one. I went from 4,000 to 16,000. 4,000, $8,000. Then we double it again, $16,000. Again, 32, I sound like\\nmy two year old again. All right, $32,000. Then we get to $64,000. And at that point something\\ninteresting happens. It's actually good that I\\nwent to the eighth month because every month\\nbefore the eighth month, Company A's payment was higher\\nuntil that eighth month. In that eighth month, Company\\nB is going to pay more. So first we can just\\nanswer their question. For which monthly payment\\nwill Company B's payment first exceed Company A's payment? Well, that is month eight, month eight. And there's a broader\\nlesson going on here. You might recognize that the\\nrate at which Company A's payment is increasing is linear. Every month it increases\\nby the same amount. So plus 5,000, plus 5,000. It increases by 5,000 the same amount. Company B is increasing exponentially. It's increasing by the\\nsame factor every time, so we're multiplying by\\nthe same value every time. We're multiplying by two,\\nwe're multiplying by two, multiplying by two. And so there's actually a\\nvery interesting thing here that you can actually\\nmake the general statement that an exponential function\\nwill, we'll want something that is exponentially\\nincreasing, will eventually always surpass something\\nthat is linearly increasing. And it doesn't matter what\\nthe initial situation is, and it also doesn't even matter that rate of exponential increase,\\nit will eventually always pass up something that's\\nincreasing linearly. And you can think about\\nthat visually if you like. If I were to draw a visual\\nfunction, a linear function, so this is x-axis, this is the y-axis, a linear function, well, this is gonna be described by a line. So it could look something like this. A linear function is always\\ngonna be a line of some slope. And an exponential function,\\neven though it might start a little bit slower, it's eventually going to pass up the linear function. And this is going to be the\\ncase even if the linear function has a pretty high slope or a\\npretty high starting point, if it's something like that,\\nand even if the exponential function is starting pretty\\nslow, it will eventually, and even if it's compounding\\nor growing relatively slow but exponentially, you know\\nif it's going 2% or 3%, it still will eventually\\npass up the linear function which is pretty cool. \",\n",
       " '12.5.1': \"- [Narrator] What we're\\ngoing to do in this video is quickly review exponential growth and then use that as our platform to introduce ourselves\\nto exponential decay. So let's review exponential growth. Let's say we have something that, and I'll do this on a table here. Just gonna make that straight. So let's say this is\\nour x and this is our y. Now let's say when x is\\nzero, y is equal to three. And every time we increase\\nx by 1, we double y. So y is gonna go from three to six. If x increases by one\\nagain, so we go to two, we're gonna double y again. And so six times two is 12. This right over here\\nis exponential growth. And you could even go for negative x's. When x is negative one, well,\\nif we're going back one in x, we would divide by two. So this is going to be 3/2. 3/2. And notice if you go from\\nnegative one to zero, you once again, you\\nkeep multiplying by two and this will keep on happening. And you can describe\\nthis with an equation. You could say that y is equal to, and sometimes people might\\ncall this your y intercept or your initial value, is equal to three,\\nessentially what happens when x equals zero, is\\nequal to three times our common ratio, and our common ratio is, well, what are we\\nmultiplying by every time we increase x by one? So three times our\\ncommon ratio two, to the to the x, to the x power. And you can verify that. Pick any of these. When x is equal to two,\\nit's gonna be three times two squared, which\\nis three times four, which is indeed equal to 12. And we can see that on a graph. So let me draw a quick\\ngraph right over here. So, I'm having trouble\\ndrawing a straight line. All right, there we go. And let's see. We could go, and they're gonna be on a slightly different\\nscale, my x and y axes. So this is x axis, y axis. And we go from negative one to one to two. Let's see, we're going\\nall the way up to 12. So let's see, this is three, six, nine, and let's say this is 12. We could just plot these points here. When x is negative one, y is 3/2. So looks like that, then at y equals zero, x is, when x is zero, y is three. When x equals one, y has doubled. It's now at six. When x is equal to two, y is 12. And you will see this tell-tale curve. And so there's a couple\\nof key features that we've Well, we've already talked\\nabout several of them, but if you go to increasingly\\nnegative x values, you will asymptote towards the x axis. It'll never quite get to zero as you get to more and\\nmore negative values, but it'll definitely approach it. And as you get to more\\nand more positive values, it just kind of skyrockets up. We always, we've talked\\nabout in previous videos how this will pass up any linear function or any linear graph eventually. Now, let's compare that\\nto exponential decay. Exponential, exponential decay. An easy way to think about it, instead of growing every\\ntime you're increasing x, you're going to shrink\\nby a certain amount. You are going to decay. So let's set up another table here with x and y values. That was really a very, this is supposed to, when I press shift, it should create a straight\\nline but my computer, I've been eating next to my computer. Maybe there's crumbs in\\nthe keyboard or something. (laughs) All right. So here we go. We have x and we have y. And so let's start with, let's say we start in the same place. So when x is zero, y is 3. But instead of doubling every\\ntime we increase x by one, let's go by half every\\ntime we increase x by one. So when x is equal to\\none, we're gonna multiply by 1/2, and so we're gonna get to 3/2. Then when x is equal to two,\\nwe'll multiply by 1/2 again and so we're going to get to 3/4 and so on and so forth. And if we were to go to negative values, when x is equal to negative one, well, to go, if we're going\\nbackwards in x by one, we would divide by 1/2, and so we would get to six. Or going from negative one to zero, as we increase x by one,\\nonce again, we're multiplying we're multiplying by 1/2. And so how would we write\\nthis as an equation? I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can write\\nit in a similar way. Well, it's gonna look something like this. It's gonna be y is equal to You have your, you could\\nhave your y intercept here, the value of y when x is equal to zero, so it's three times, what's\\nour common ratio now? Well, every time we increase x by one, we're multiplying by 1/2 so 1/2 and we're gonna\\nraise that to the x power. And so notice, these\\nare both exponentials. We have some, you could say\\ny intercept or initial value, it is being multiplied\\nby some common ratio to the power x. Some common ratio to the power x. But notice when you're\\ngrowing our common ratio and it actually turns\\nout to be a general idea, when you're growing, your common ratio, the absolute value of your common ratio is going to be greater than one. Let me write it down. So the absolute value of two in this case is greater than one. But when you're shrinking,\\nthe absolute value of it is less than one. And that makes sense, because if the, if you have something\\nwhere the absolute value is less than one, like 1/2 or 3/4 or 0.9, every time you multiply it, you're gonna get a lower\\nand lower and lower value. And you could actually\\nsee that in a graph. Let's graph the same\\ninformation right over here. And let me do it in a different color. I'll do it in a blue color. So when x is equal to negative one, y is equal to six. When x is equal to zero,\\ny is equal to three. When x is equal to one, y is equal to 3/2. When x is equal to two, y is equal to 3/4. And so on and so forth. And notice, because our common\\nratios are the reciprocal of each other, that these two graphs look\\nlike they've been flipped over, they look like they've\\nbeen flipped horizontally or flipped over the y axis. They're symmetric around that y axis. And what you will see in exponential decay is that things will get smaller\\nand smaller and smaller, but they'll never quite\\nexactly get to zero. It'll approach zero. It'll asymptote towards the x axis as x becomes more and more positive. Just as for exponential growth, if x becomes more and more negative, we asymptote towards the x axis. So that's the introduction. I'd use a very specific\\nexample, but in general, if you have an equation of\\nthe form y is equal to A times some common ratio to the x power We could write it like\\nthat, just to make it a little bit clearer. There's a bunch of different\\nways that we could write it. This is going to be exponential growth, so if the absolute value\\nof r is greater than one, then we're dealing with growth, because every time you multiply, every time you increase\\nx, you're multiplying by more and more r's is\\none way to think about it. And if the absolute value\\nof r is less than one, you're dealing with decay. You're shrinking as x increases. And I'll let you think\\nabout what happens when, what happens when r is equal to one? What are we dealing\\nwith in that situation? And it's a bit of a trick question, because it's actually quite, oh, I'll just tell you. If r is equal to one, well\\nthen, this thing right over here is always going to be equal to one and you boil down to just\\nthe constant equation, y is equal to A, so this would\\njust be a horizontal line. \",\n",
       " '12.5.2': \"- [Voiceoer] This is from the graph basic exponential functions on Khan Academy. They asked us graph the\\nfollowing exponential function. And they give us the function, h of x is equal to 27 times 1/3 to the x. So our initial value is 27\\nand 1/3 is our common ratio. It's written in a\\nstandard exponential form. And it gives us some graphing tool where we can define these two points and we can also define a horizontal asymptote to construct our function. And these three things\\nare enough to define to graph an exponential if we know that it is an exponential function. So let's think about it a little bit. So the easiest thing\\nthat I could think of is, well, let's think about its initial value. Its initial value is going\\nto be x equal to zero. X equal zeros, 1/3 to the\\nzero power is just one and so you're just left with\\n27 times one or just 27. That's what we call this number here when you've written in this form. You call this the initial value. So when x is equal to zero, h of x is equal to 27. Now we're graphing y=h(x). So now let's graph another point. So let's think about it a little bit. When x is equal to one, when x is equal to one, what is h of x? It's gonna be 1/3 to the first power which is just 1/3. And so 1/3 times 27 is gonna be nine. So when x is one, h of one is nine. And we can verify. And now let's just think about, let's think about the asymptote. So what's gonna happen here when x becomes really, really, really, really,\\nreally, really, really big? If I take 1/3 to like a\\nreally large exponent to, say to the 10th power\\nor to the 100th power or to the 1000th power, this\\nthing right over here is going to start approaching\\nzero as x becomes much, much, much, much larger. And so something that is\\napproaching zero times 27, well, that's going to\\napproach zero as well. So we're gonna have a\\nhorizontal asymptote at zero. And you can verify that this works for more than just a two\\npoints we talk about. When x is equal to, this is\\ntelling us that the graph, y equals h of x goes to\\nthe point two comma three. So h of two should be equal to three. And you can verify that\\nthat is indeed the case. If x is two, 1/3 squared is nine. Oh sorry, 1/3 squared is 1/9 times 27 is three. And we see that right over here. When x is two, h of two is three. So I feel pretty good about that. Let's do another one of this. So graph the following\\nexponential function. So same logic. When x is zero, the g\\nof zero is just gonna boiled out to that initial value. And so you scroll down. Initial value is negative 30. And so let's think about\\nwhen x is equal to one. When x is equal to one, two to\\nthe first power is just two. And so two times negative\\n30 is negative 60. So when x is equal to one, the value of the graph is negative 60. Now let's think about this asymptote over that, it should sit. So let's think about what\\nhappens when x becomes really, really, really, really,\\nreally, really negative. So when x is really negative, so two to the negative one power is 1/2. Two to the negative two is 1/4. Two to the negative three is 1/8. As it gets larger and larger negative or higher magnitude negative values or in other words, as x becomes more and more and more negative, two to that power is\\ngoing to approach zero. And so negative 30 times\\nsomething approaching zero is going to approach zero. So this asymptote is in the right place, a horizontal asymptote as x\\napproaches negative infinity. As we move further and\\nfurther to the left, the value of a function\\nis going to approach zero. Now we can see it kind of\\napproaches zero from below. We can see they approaches below because we already looked\\nat the initial value and we used that common ratio\\nto find one other point. Hopefully, you found that interesting. \",\n",
       " '12.5.3': \"- [Instructor] We are told\\na phone sells for $600 and loses 25% of its value per year. Write a function that gives\\nthe phone's value, V of t, so value as a function of\\ntime, t years after it is sold. So pause this video, and have a go at that before we work through it together. All right, so let's just\\nthink about it a little bit. And I could even set up a table to think about what is going on. So this is t, and this\\nis the value of our phone as a function of t. So it sells for $600. At time t equals zero, what is V of zero? Well it's going to be equal to $600. That's what it sells for\\nat time t equals zero. Now at t equals one,\\nwhat's going to happen? Well it says that the phone loses 25% of its value per year. Another way to rewrite that\\nit loses 25% of its value per year is that it retains, it retains, 100% minus 25% of its value per year, or it retains 75% of its value per year, per year. So how much is it going to\\nbe worth after one year? Well it's going to be worth $600, $600 times 75%. Now what about year two? Well it's going to be worth\\nwhat it was in year one times 75% again. So it's going to be $600\\ntimes 75% times 75%. And so you could write\\nthat as times 75% squared. And I think you see a pattern. In general, if we have gone,\\nlet's just call it t years, well then the value of our phone, if we're saying it in dollars,\\nis just going to be $600 times, and I could write it as a decimal, 0.75, instead of 75%, to the t power. So V of t is going to be equal to 600 times 0.75 to the t power, and we're done. Let's do another example. So here, we are told that\\na biologist has a sample of 6,000 cells. The biologist introduces\\na virus that kills 1/3 of the cells every week. Write a function that gives\\nthe number of cells remaining, which would be C of t, the\\ncells as a function of time, in the sample t weeks after\\nthe virus is introduced. So again, pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, so I'll set\\nup another table again. So this is time, it's in weeks, and this is the number of cells, C. We could say it's a function of time. So time t equals zero, when\\nzero weeks have gone by, we have 6,000 cells. That's pretty clear. Now after one week, how\\nmany cells do we have? What's C of one? Well it says that the virus kills 1/3 of the cells every week,\\nwhich is another way of saying that 2/3 of the cells are able to live for the next week. And so after one week, we're\\ngoing to have 6,000 times 2/3. And then after two weeks,\\nor another week goes by, we're gonna have 2/3 of\\nthe number that we had after one week. So we're gonna have 6,000\\ntimes 2/3 times 2/3, or we could just write\\nthat as 2/3 squared. So once again, you are likely\\nseeing the pattern here. We are going to, at time t\\nequals zero, we have 6,000, and then we're going to multiply by 2/3 however many weeks have gone by. So the cells as a function\\nof the weeks of t, which is in weeks, is going\\nto be our original amount, and then however many weeks have gone by, we're going to multiply\\nby 2/3 that many times, so times 2/3 to the t power. And we're done. \",\n",
       " '12.6.1': \"- [Voiceover] g is an exponential function with an initial value of -2. So, an initial value of -2, and a common ratio of 1/7, common ratio of 1/7. Write the formula for g(t). Well, the fact that it's\\nan exponential function, we know that its formula is going to be of the form g(t) is equal to our initial value which we could call A, times our common ratio\\nwhich we could call r, to the t power. It's going to have that form. And they tell us what\\nthe initial value is. It's -2. So this right over here is -2. And we know that the common ratio is 1/7. So this is 1/7. So let me just write it\\nagain a little bit neater. g(t) is going to be equal to our initial value, -2, times times our common ratio, 1/7, to the t power. And hopefully this makes sense. Initial value is this number. Well, if t is equal to 0, then 1/7 to the zero power is 1. And so g(0), you could do that at time as being equal to zero if your t is time, would be equal to -2. So that would be our initial value. And then if you think about it, every time you increase t by one, you're going to mulitply by 1/7 again. And so, the ratio between successive terms is going to be 1/7. And so that's why we call that the common ratio. Hopefully, you found that interesting. \",\n",
       " '12.6.2': \"Consider the following table\\nof values for a linear function f of x is equal to mx plus b\\nand an exponential function g of x is equal to a\\ntimes r to the x. Write the equation\\nfor each function. And so they give us,\\nfor each x-value, what f of x is and\\nwhat g of x is. And we need to figure out the\\nequation for each function and type them in over here. So I copy and\\npasted this problem on my little scratchpad. So let's first think\\nabout the linear function. And to figure out the\\nequation of a line or a linear function\\nright over here, you really just need two points. And I always like to use the\\nsituation when x equals 0 because that makes\\nit very clear what the y-intercept is going to be. So, for example, we\\ncan say that f of 0 is going to be equal\\nto m times 0 plus b. Or this is just going\\nto be equal to b. And they tell us that\\nf of 0 is equal to 5. b is equal to 5. So we immediately know\\nthat this b right over here is equal to 5. Now, we just have\\nto figure out the m. We have to figure out\\nthe slope of this line. So just as a little bit\\nof a refresher on slope, the slope of this line is\\ngoing to be our change in y-- or our change in our function\\nI guess we could say, if we say that this\\ny is equal to f of x-- over our change in x. And actually, let me\\nwrite it that way. We could write\\nthis as our change in our function\\nover our change in x if you want to look\\nat it that way. So let's look at\\nthis first change in x when x goes from 0 to 1. So we finish at 1. We started at 0. And f of x finishes\\nat 7 and started at 5. So when x is 1, f of x is 7. When x is 0, f of x is 5. And we get a change\\nin our function of 2 when x changes by 1. So our m is equal to 2. And you see that. When x increases by 1, our\\nfunction increases by 2. So now we know the\\nequation for f of x. f of x is going to be equal\\nto 2 times 2x plus b, or 5. So we figured out\\nwhat f of x is. Now we need to figure\\nout what g of x is. So g of x is an\\nexponential function. And there's really two things\\nthat we need to figure out. We need to figure\\nout what a is, and we need to figure out what r is. And let me just rewrite that. So we know that g of x--\\nmaybe I'll do it down here. g of x is equal to a\\ntimes r to the x power. And if we know what g of 0 is,\\nthat's a pretty useful thing. Because r to the 0th\\npower, regardless of what r is-- or\\nI guess we could assume that r is not equal to 0. People can debate what\\n0 to the 0 power is. But if r is any\\nnon-zero number, we know that if you raise it\\nto the 0 power, you get 1. And so that\\nessentially gives us a. So let's just write that down. g of 0 is a times r to\\nthe 0 power, which is just going to be equal\\nto a times 1 or a. And they tell us what g of\\n0 is. g of 0 is equal to 3. So we know that a is equal to 3. So so far, we know that our g\\nof x can be written as 3 times r to the x power. So now we can just use any\\none of the other values they gave us to solve for r. For example, they tell us\\nthat g of 1 is equal to 2. So let's write\\nthat down. g of 1, which would be 3 times r to\\nthe first power, or just 3-- let me just write it. It could be 3 times\\nr to the first power, or we could just write\\nthat as 3 times r. They tell us that g\\nof 1 is equal to 2. So we get 3 times\\nr is equal to 2. Or we get that r\\nis equal to 2/3. Divide both sides of\\nthis equation by 3. So r is 2/3. And we're done. g of x is equal to 3 times 2/3. Actually, let me just\\nwrite it this way. 3 times 2/3 to the x power. You could write it that way\\nif you want, any which way. So 3 times 2/3 to the x power,\\nand f of x is 2x plus 5. So let's actually\\njust type that in. So f of x is 2x plus 5. And we can verify that that's\\nthe expression that we want. And g of x is 3 times 2\\nover 3 to the x power. And let me just verify that\\nthat's what I did there. I have a short memory. All right. Yeah, that looks right. All right. Let's check our answer. And we got it right. \",\n",
       " '12.6.3': \"- [Instructor] The graphs of\\nthe linear function f of x is equal to mx plus b and the exponential function g of x is equal to a times r to the x where r is greater than zero pass through the points\\nnegative one comma nine, so this is negative one\\ncomma nine right over here, and one comma one. Both graphs are given below. So this very clearly\\nis the linear function. It is a line right over here. And this right over here is\\nthe exponential function, so right over here. And given the fact that\\nthis exponential function keeps decreasing as x gets\\nlarger and larger and larger is a pretty good hint that\\nour r right over here, they tell us that r is greater than zero, but it's a pretty good hint that r is going to be\\nbetween zero and one. The fact that g of x keeps approaching, it's getting closer and\\ncloser and closer to zero as x increases. But let's use the data they're giving us, the two points of intersection, to figure out what the equations\\nof these two functions are. So first we can tackle\\nthe linear function. So f of x is equal to mx plus b. So they give us two points. We could use those points\\nfirst to figure out the slope. So our m, our m right over\\nhere, that's our slope. That's our change in y over change in x. The rate and change of the vertical axis with respect to the horizontal axis. So let's see, between those two points, what is our change in x? Our change in x, we're going from x equals\\nnegative one to x equals one. X equals one. So we could think of it\\nas we're finishing at one. We started at negative one. So one minus negative one,\\nour change in x is two. We see that right over there. And what about our change in y? Well, we start at nine. Let me do this in maybe\\nanother color here. We start at nine, and we end up at one. So we end up at one. We started at nine. One minus nine is negative eight. And just to be clear,\\nwhen x is one, y is one. When x is negative one, y is nine. Another way to think about it, the way I drew it right over here, we're finishing at x\\nequals one, y equals one. We started at x equals\\nnegative one, y equals nine, and so we just took the differences. We get negative eight over two, which is equal to negative four. Which is equal to negative four. And so now we can write that f of x is equal to negative four, negative four, that's our slope, times x. Negative four times x plus b. And you can see that\\nslope right over here. Every time you increase your... Every time you increase your x by one. I gotta be careful here,\\nI got a little bit. Every time you increase your x by one, you're decreasing your y. And here on the x axis,\\nwe're marking off every half. So every time you increase your x by one, you are decreasing your y. You are decreasing your y by four there, so that makes sense that\\nthe slope is negative four. So now let's think about what b is. So to figure out b, we could\\nuse either one of these points to figure out, given an x, what f of x is, and then we can solve for by. Let's try one, 'cause one\\nis a nice, simple number. So we could write f of one, which would be negative\\nfour times one plus b. And they tell us that f of\\none is one, is equal to one. And so this part right over here, we could write that as negative\\nfour plus b is equal to one, and then we could add four to\\nboth sides of this equation, and then we get b is equal to five. So we get f of x is equal\\nto negative 4x plus five. Now, does that make sense that the y-intercept here is five? Well, you see that right over here. By inspection, you could\\nhave guessed, actually, that the y-intercept here is five, but now we've solved it. Maybe this was 5.00001 or something, but now we know for sure\\nit's negative 4x plus five. Or another way you could've said it, if the slope is negative four, if this right over here is nine, you increase one in the x direction, you're gonna decrease\\nfour in the y direction, and that will get you\\nto y is equal to five, so that is the y-intercept. But either way, we have figured\\nout the linear function. Now let's figure out the\\nexponential function. So here we could just use the two points to figure out these two unknowns. So, for example, let's\\ntry this first point. So g of negative one, which if we look at this right over here, would be a times r to the negative one. They tell us that g of negative one is going to be equal to nine. G of negative one is equal to nine. And so we could write this a\\ntimes r to the negative one. That's the same thing as\\na over r is equal to nine, or we could multiply both sides by r, and we could say a is equal to 9r. Now let's use this other point. This other point, they tell us. They tell us that g of one, which would be the same thing as a times r to the first\\npower or just a times r, that that is equal to one,\\nor a times r is equal to one. So how can we use this\\ninformation right here, a is equal to 9r and a\\ntimes r is equal to one, to solve for a and r? Well, I have a little system here. It is a non-linear system,\\nbut it's a pretty simple one. We could just take this a and substitute it in\\nright over here for a, and so we would get 9r for a. This first constraint tells\\nus a must be equal to 9r. So 9r, instead of writing\\nan a here, I'll write 9r, times r is equal to one. Or we could write, let me\\nscroll down a little bit. We could write 9r squared is equal to one. Divide both sides by nine. R squared is equal to one over nine. And now to figure out r, you might wanna take the\\npositive and negative square root of both sides, but they tell\\nus that r is greater than zero, so we can just take the\\nprincipal root of both sides and we get r is equal to 1/3. And then we could substitute this back into either one of these other\\ntwo to figure out what a is. We know that a is equal to nine times r. So nine times 1/3, a is equal to three. So our exponential function\\ncould be written as g of x is equal to a, which is\\nthree, times r, which is 1/3, 1/3 to the x power. \",\n",
       " '12.6.4': \"- [Voiceover] Let's say\\nthat we have an exponential function, h of n, and since it's an exponential function it's going to be in the\\nform a times r to the n, where a is our initial value and r is our common ratio, and we're going to assume\\nthat r is greater than zero. And they've given us some\\ninformation on h of n. We know that when n is equal to 2, h of 2 is 144, that h of 4 is 324, that h of 6 is 729. So, based on the information here, let's see if we can actually figure out what a and r are going to be. And like always, pause the\\nvideo and try to give it a go. All right, now let's do this together. So I'm going to focus on r first. The common ratio and if we had successive n's. If we had h of 3, then\\nwe could just find the ratio between h of 3 and h of 2 and r would just come out of that, or if the ratio between h of 4 and h of 3, we could solve explicitly for r, but we can get pretty close to that. We can just find the ratio between h of 4 and h of 2. So, h of 4, the ratio between h of 4 and h of 2 is going to be equal to, well, we know h of 4 is 324, and h of 2 is 144, and we could simplify this a little bit. Let's see, if we, if we simplify this, we would get, they're both divisible by 2. If we divide them both by 2, this one in the numerator, 324 divided by 2 is 162. 144 divided by 2 is 72. Let's see, we can divide by 2 again. 81 over 36. Divide by 2, actually, no, we can't\\ndivide by 2 anymore, but we can divide by 9 now, so 81 divided by 9 is 9, and 36 divided by 9 is 4. So this thing can be rewritten as 9/4, but we could also rewrite this ratio by using, using this form of an\\nexponential function, so we could also say that\\nthis is going to be equal to, h of 4 is going to be a times r. Now n is 4, so r to the 4th power, and h of 2 is going to be\\na times r to the 2nd power. A times r to the 2nd power, and this simplifies nicely, a divided by a, cancels to just 1, and r to the 4th divided by r-squared, well that's going to be\\nr to the 4 minus 2 power, or r, it's going to be r to the 2nd power, it's going to be r-squared, and so we have a nice\\nlittle equation set up. R-squared needs to be equal to 9/4. So let me write that down. R-squared is equal to 9/4, and r needs to be greater than zero, so we could just say r is\\ngoing to be the principal root of 9/4, which is equal to 3/2. So we were able to figure out r. So now how do we figure out, how do we figure out a? Well, there's a couple of ways to do it. You can think about a is\\ngoing to be what h of zero is equal to, so we could do, I guess we could call it a tabular method, where, let me set up a little table here. So, a little table, so if this is n and this is h of n, so n is zero, we don't know what h of zero is just yet, it's going to be a. We don't know what h of 1 is yet. We do know that h of 2 is 144. And we do know, since\\nthe common ratio is 3/2, if we take h of 1 and\\nwe multiply it by 3/2, we're going to get h of 2, and if we take h of zero\\nand multiply it by 3/2, we're going to get h of 1. So, h of 1 is going to\\nbe 144 divided by 3/2. So let's write that down. H of 1 is equal to 144 divided by 3/2, which is going to be 144, 144 times 2 over 3, and let's see, 144 divided by 3 is going to be equal to, is it, let's see, one 3 goes into, I'll just do this by hand, my brain doesn't work that well while I'm making videos. 3 goes into 14 four times, 4 times 3 is 12, subtract, so it's going to be, I see, it's going to be 48. 3 goes into 24 eight times. 8 times 3 is 24, you have no remainder, so, this is going to be 48 times 2, which is going to be equal to 96 so this is going to be 96, and so if we want to figure out h of zero, we just divide by 3/2 again, so, h of zero is 96 divided by 3/2 which is equal to 96 times 2 over 3. 96 divided by 3, let's see, it's going to be 32, so this is going to be 32 times, did I do that right? Yup, 32 times 2 which is equal to 64. 64. And so, just like that,\\nwe've figured out that a is equal to 64, and r, and r is equal to 3/2. So we can write h of n, we can say that h of n is equal to 64, is equal to 64 times 3/2, times 3/2, our common ratio, to the nth power. Now, there's another way that\\nwe could have tackled this instead of this tabular method. We could have just solved for a now, since we know r. We know, for example, we know for example that h of 2 which is going to be equal to a times, we know what our common ratio is, it's 3/2 to the 2nd power, is going to be equal to 144. And so, we could say a times 9 over 4 is equal to 144, and so we can multiply both\\nsides times the reciprocal of 9 over 4, so we multiply both sides times 4 over 9, times 4 over 9, and that cancels with that, that cancels with that, and we are left with a is equal to, well let's see, 144 divided by 9 is going to be, is going to be, I want\\nto say it's equal to 16? Is that right? I think that is right. Yup, and then 16 times 4, so this is going to be 16 and 1, 16 times 4 is 64, which is exactly what we got before, and so this actually, this method, now that I look at it, is actually a good bit easier, but they're equivalent, and I like this one because\\nyou get to see the common ratio in action, and you get\\nto see that the initial value is the initial value. It is h of zero, but either way, once you figure out r, and you know one of the h of, you know what the function is at a value, you can solve for a, and frankly, if you\\nknew a and you knew what the function was for a given n, you could likewise solve for r. So hopefully you enjoyed that. \",\n",
       " '12.6.5': \"- [Voiceover] So we have the graph of an exponential function here,\\nand the function is m of x. And what I want to do\\nis figure out what is m of six going to be equal to? And like always, pause the video, and see if you can work it out. Well, as I mentioned, this\\nis an exponential function, so m is going to take the form. Let me write it this way. M of x is going to take the form a times r to the xth power, where a is our initial power,\\nand r is our common ratio. Well the initial value is\\npretty straightforward. It's just going to be what m of zero is. So a is going to be equal to m of zero, and we can just look at this graph. When x is equal to zero, the\\nfunction is equal to nine. So it's equal to nine, and now we need to figure out our common ratio. So let me set up a little\\nbit of a table here, just to help us with this. So let me draw some straight lines. And so this is x and m of x. We already know that when x is zero, m of x is equal to nine. We also know when x is, let's see. When x is one, when x\\nis one, m of x is three. M of x is three. So when we increase our x by one, what happened to our m of x? Well, what did we have to multiply it by? Well, to go from nine to three, you multiplied by 1/3. So that's going to be our common ratio. And in fact, if we wanted to care what m of two is going to be, we\\nwould multiply by 1/3 again. And m of two should be equal to one, and we see that right over here. M of two is, indeed, equal to one. So our common ratio, our common ratio right over here is equal to 1/3. So m of x, we can write it as, m of x is going to be equal to\\nour initial value, a, which we already figured it out, as a is, a is equal to nine, so\\nit's going to be nine, times our common ratio,\\ntimes our common ratio, 1/3 to the xth power. So I was able to figure out\\nthe formula for our definition for m of x, but that's not what I wanted. I just wanted to figure out\\nwhat m of six is going to be. So we can write down that m of six, m of six is going to be nine times one over three to the sixth power. Let's see, that is going to be equal to, that's the same thing as nine times, well one to the six is just one. That's just going to be one to the six, which is just one, over\\nthree to the sixth power. Now what is three to the sixth power? In fact, I can even simplify\\nthis a little bit more. I can recognize that\\nnine is three squared, so I could say this is going to be three squared over three to the sixth. Three squared over three to the sixth, and then, I could tackle\\nthis a couple of ways. I could just divide the\\nnumerator into the denominator by three squared, in\\nwhich case, I would get one over three to the fourth power. Or another way to think\\nabout it, this should be the same thing as three\\nto the two minus sixth power, which is the same thing as three\\nto the negative four power, which is, of course, the same thing as one over three to the fourth. So what's three to the fourth? So three squared is nine. Three to the third is 27. Three to the fourth is 81. So this is going to be\\nequal to one over 81. M of six is equal to one over 81. We could also, we could've done that if we kept going by our table. M of three, multiply it by 1/3, is going to be 1/3. M of four, multiply by 1/3 again, is going to be 1/9. Then we could, m of five is going to be 1/27, and m of six is going to be 181st. \",\n",
       " '12.6.6': \"- [Voiceover] So we have a\\ngraph here of the function f of x, and I'm telling\\nyou right now that f of x is going to be an exponential function. It looks like one, but\\nit's even nicer when someone tells you that. And our goal in this video is\\nto figure out at what x value, so when does f of x? At what x value is f of x going to be equal to negative 1/25. And you might be tempted to\\njust eyeball it over here, but when f of x is\\nnegative 1/25, that's like right below the x-axis. If I try to eyeball it, it\\nwould be very difficult. It's very difficult to\\ntell what value that is. It might be at three, it might be at four. I am not sure. Well, I don't want to just\\neyeball it, just guess it. Instead, I'm gonna\\nactually find an expression that defines f of x because they've given us some information here. And then I can just solve\\nfor x, so let's do that. Well, since we know that f of\\nx is an exponential function, we know it's going to take the form f of x is equal to our initial value a times our common ratio r to the xth power. Well, the initial value\\nis straightforward enough. That's going to be the value\\nthat the function takes on when x is equal to zero. And you can even see it\\nhere, if x is equal to zero, the r to the x would just be one. And so f of zero will just be equal to a. And so what is f of zero? Well, when x is equal to zero, which essentially we're saying, where does it intersect the y-axis? We see f of zero is negative 25. So a is going to be negative 25. When x is zero, the r\\nto the x is just one. So f of zero is going to be negative 25. We see that right over there. Now to figure out the common ratio, there's a couple of ways\\nyou could think about it. The common ratio is the ratio between two successive values\\nthat are separated by one. What do I mean by that? Well, you could view\\nit as the ratio between f of one and f of zero. That's going to be the common ratio. Or the ratio between f of two and f of one. That is going to be the common ratio. Well, lucky for us, we know\\nf of zero is negative 25. And we know that f of one,\\nwhen x is equal to one, y, or f of x, or f of one\\nis equal to negative five. And so just like that\\nwe're able to figure out that our common ratio r is\\nnegative five over negative 25, which is the same thing as 1/5. Divide a negative by a\\nnegative, you get a positive. So you get a five over 25, which is 1/5. We can write an expression\\nthat defines f of x. f of x is going to be equal to negative 25 times 1/5 to the x power. And so let's go back to our question. When is this going to be\\nequal to negative 1/25? So when is this equal to negative 1/25? Well, let's just set\\nthem equal to each other. There's a siren outside. I don't know if you hear it. I'll power through. So let's see at what x\\nvalue does this expression equal negative 1/25? Let's see, we can multiply. Well, actually, we want to solve for x. So let's see, let's divide\\nboth sides by negative 25. And so we are going to get 1/5 to the xth power is equal to, if we divide\\nboth sides by negative 25, this negative 25 is gonna go away. And on the right-hand\\nside, we're going to have, divide a negative by a negative\\nis going to be positive. It's going to be 1/625. And 1/5 to the xth power. This is the same thing\\nas one to the xth power over five to the xth power is equal to 1/625. Well, one to the xth power is just going to be equal to one. It doesn't matter that we have this to the xth power over here. I thought I was erasing\\nthat with a black color. There you go, that's a black\\ncolor right over there. So we can see that five to the xth power needs to be equal to 625. So let me write that over here. Whoops, didn't change my color. Five to the xth power needs to be equal to 625. Now the best way I could\\nthink of doing this is let's just think\\nabout our powers of five. So five to the first power is five. Five squared is 25. Five to the third is 125. Five to the fourth, we'll\\nmultiply that by five, you're going to get 625. So x is going to be 4 cause five to the fourth power is 625. So we can now say that f of four is equal to negative 1/25. And once again, you can verify that. You can verify that right over here. 1/5 to the fourth power is gonna be 1/625. Negative 25 over positive 625\\nis going to be negative 1/25. So hopefully that clears\\nthings up a little bit. \",\n",
       " '12.6.7': \"- [Instructor] Sarah Swift\\ngot a speeding ticket on her way home from work. If she pays her fine now there\\nwill be no added penalty. If she delays her payment then\\na penalty will be assessed for the number of months, t, that she delays paying her fine. Her total fine, F, in euros, is indicated in the table below. These numbers represent an exponential, an exponential function. So they give us the number of months that the payment is delayed and then the amount of fine. And this is essentially data points from an exponential function. Just to remind ourselves\\nwhat an exponential function would look like, this tells us that our fine as our function of the months delayed is going to be equal to some number times some common ratio to the t power. This telling us this exponential function is essentially telling\\nus that our function is going to have this\\nform right over here. So let's see if we can\\nanswer their questions. So the first question is\\nwhat is the common ratio of consecutive values of F? So the reason why r right over here is called the common ratio is it's the ratio that\\nif you look at any two, say if you were to increment t by one the ratio of that to F of t, that ratio should be consistent for any t. So let me give you an example here. The ratio of F of two to F of one should be equal to the ratio\\nof F of three to F of two, which should be the same\\nas the ratio of F of four to F of three. Or in general terms the\\nratio of F of t plus one to the ratio of F of t should be equal to all of these things. That would be the common ratio. So let's see what that is. If we just look at the form, if we just look at this right over here. So what's the ratio of\\nF of two to F of one? 450 divided by 300, well that's 1.5. That's 1.5. 675 divided by 450, that's 1.5. 1,012.5 divided by 675, that's 1.5. So the common ratio in all\\nof these situations is 1.5. So the common ratio over here is 1.5. And another way, and just to to make it clear\\nwhy this r right over here is called the common ratio, is let's just do this general form. So F of t plus one, well that's\\njust going to be a times r to the t plus one power, and F of t is a times r to the t power. So what is this going to be? This is going to be... Let's see, this is going to be\\nr to the t plus one minus t, which is just going to be\\nequal to r to the first power, which is just equal to r. So this variable, r, is going to be equal to this common ratio. So whether we figured out\\nthat the common ratio is 1.5, that tells us that our function\\nis going to be of the form F of t is equal to a times,\\ninstead of writing an r there we now know that r is 1.5 to the t power. 1.5 to the t power. Write a formula for this function. Well we've almost done that, but we haven't figured out what a is. And to figure out what a is\\nwe could just substitute. We know what F of one is. When t is equal to one, F is equal to 300, and so we should be able\\nto use that information to solve for a. We could have used any of these\\ndata points to solve for a, but let's do that. F of one is equal to a times\\n1.5 to the first power, or a times 1.5, and that\\nis going to be equal to, they tell us that F of\\none is equal to 300. And so another way of writing this is we could say 1.5\\ntimes a is equal to 300. Divide both sides by 1.5 and we get a is equal to 200. And so our function, our\\nformula for our function, is, let me write it in black so we can see it. It's going to be 200, that's our a, times 1.5 to the t power. Now another way... Well actually let's just\\nthink about the next question. What is the fine in euros\\nfor Sarah's speeding ticket if she pays it on time? So paying it on time, that\\nimplies that t is equal to zero. Or another way of thinking about it, we need to figure out her\\nfine for t equals zero. So we need to figure out F of zero. So what's F of zero? It's 200 times 1.5 to the zero power. 1.5 to the zero power is one, so that's just going to\\nbe equal to 200 euro. Now another way of thinking\\nabout it is, well look, let's look at the common ratio. To go from 675 to 450 you're essentially dividing\\nby the common ratio. To go from 450 to 300, you're\\ndividing by the common ratio. So then to go from t\\nequals one to t equals zero you would divide by the common ratio again and you would get to 200. Or another way of thinking about it is to go to successive\\nvalues, or successive months, every time we are multiplying\\nby the common ratio. Every time we are multiplying, we are multiplying by the common ratio. \",\n",
       " '12.7.1': \"- [Voiceover] The number\\nof branches of an oak tree and a birch tree since\\n1950 are represented by the following tables. So for the oak tree we\\nsee when time equals zero has 34 branches. After three years it has 46 branches, so on and so forth. And in the birch tree\\nthey give us similar data. At the beginning has eight branches. In 10 years has 33 branches\\nand they give us all of that. What I want to think about in this video is how should we model these? If we want to model these with functions and the choices we'll give ourselves, there are other options, but the choices we'll give\\nourselves in this video are linear, and linear versus exponential functions. Which of these are going to be better for modeling this data? So let's first look at the oak tree. A key to realization is,\\nwhenever I have a fixed increase in time, so each of these steps, this is plus three years. So it's a fixed increase in time. What happens to my number of branches? Is it going to be a fixed change, or roughly a fixed change in which case a linear model might be good, or is it going to be a\\nchange that's dependent on where we were? So what am I talking about? So 34 to 46, that is plus 12. 46 to 59 is plus 13. 59 to 70 is plus 11. 70 to 82 is plus 12. So at first you mention,\\nwell this isn't exactly a fixed change. These numbers they seem to\\naverage right around 12, but when you're looking at real world data you're never gonna get\\nsomething that is exact. The models are just going\\nto give us a good fit. Are going to give us a good approximation of the behavior of the\\nnumber of branches over time. For me, this is pretty close\\nto a constant 12 branches a year. So I would construct a linear model here. I would say here branches as a function of time. Let me be clear, this\\nisn't 12 branches per year, this is 12 branches every three years. This is 13 branches over three years. This was 11 branches over three years. We're going to average 12\\nbranches over three years. So the number of branches we have, we're gonna start at 34 branches and then minus. If we have 12 branches every three years, that's four branches every, or I should say plus. Four branches every year. And you could test this out. B of zero is gonna give us 34 branches. B of 12. Let's just really test out\\nthe extreme part of the model. B of 12 is going to be 34 plus 48, which is equal to 82. So this model works quite well. It's gonna have a couple of places where it's not exactly fitting the data, but it fits it quite, quite well. This is the linear model. So this one is linear. We also got the birch tree. So time equals zero, so\\nfixed change in time. Alright, so we have a fixed change in time every time we are moving\\ninto the future, a decade. Let's see, our change in branches. We go from eight to 33. So what is that? That is plus 25 branches. Then we go from 33 to 128. Well that's way more than 25 branches. That's going to be what? Five less than 100. So that's gonna be plus 95 branches. So this clearly is not a linear model. And so let's think in terms\\nof an exponential model. How much do we have to\\nmultiply to go from... Did I do that right? 128 minus, yeah, if it was 133 then it would be 100 and it's five less than that, okay. So now let's think about it in terms of an exponential model. In terms of an exponential model what do we have to multiply for each step? So if we have a constant step in time, what do we multiply for how much we increase our branches? So if we go to eight to 33, it's gonna be approximately four. It's gonna be a little bit more than four. 33 to 128, well that's gonna be a\\nlittle bit less than four, but it's approximately four. 33 times four would be\\n132, so we're close. 128 to 512, that's exactly four, right? That's exactly 120 times four is 480 plus 32, yup, that is exactly four. So times four. And so it looks like we\\nkeep multiplying by four every 10 years that go by. So one way to think about it is we could say here, BFT, the branches of T, our initial condition,\\nour initial state is eight and now we could say our\\ncommon factor is four. But if we want T to be in years, well every 10 years we\\nmultiply by a factor of four. So T has to go to 10 before we increase the exponent to one, or has to go to 20 until\\nthis exponent becomes two. So eight times four to the T over 10 power seems like a pretty good model. And you could even verify\\nthis for yourself if you like. Try out what B of 30 is going to be. B of 30 would be eight times four. 30 divided by 10 to the third power and what is that going to be? That's going to be four\\nto the third is 64. 64. Eight times 64 is, it's 480 plus 32. It is 512. So once again, this exponential model for this data does a pretty good job. \",\n",
       " '12.7.2': \"- [Voiceover] The temperature\\nof a glass of warm water after it's put in a freezer is represented by the following table. So we have time in minutes and then we have the\\ncorresponding temperature at different times in minutes. Which model for C of t, the temperature of the glass of water t minutes after it's served, best fits the data? So pause the video and see which of these\\nmodels best fit the data. Alright, now let's work\\nthrough this together. So in order for it, we see these choices. Some of these choices\\nare exponential models. Some of these are linear models. In order for a linear model\\nto be a good description, when you have a fixed change in time, you should have a fixed\\nchange in temperature. If you're dealing with\\nan exponential model, then as you have a fixed change in time, you should be changing by the same factor so the amount you change from say minute one to minute two or from minute two to minute three, it's not going to be the exact same amount but it should be the same\\nfactor of where you started. So let's think about this. So here, our change in time is two minutes. What is the absolute\\nchange in temperature? So our absolute change in temperature is negative what, 15.7. Negative 15.7 and what if we viewed\\nit as a multiplication? So what do multiply 80 by to get 64.3? Well, I can get a calculator out for that. So 64.3 divided by 80 is equal to 0.8 I'll just say approximately .8 So we could multiply by .0.8 This is going to be approximate. So to get from 80 to 64.3 I could either subtract by 15.7 if I'm dealing with a linear model or I can multiply by 0.8 Now if I increase my time again by two, I'm going from minute two to minute four, so Delta t is equal to two, the absolute change here is what? This is going to be not 12. This is going to be, my brain isn't functioning optimally. This was 64.7 then this would be 12 but it's four less than that so it's 11.6. Negative 11.6 but if you look at it as\\nmultiplying it by a factor, what would you have to\\nmultiply by approximately? Let's get the calculator back out. So if I said 52.7 divided by 64.3. Divided by 64.3 is equal to, that's about .82. So times 0.82. So just by looking at this, I can keep going but it looks like for our\\ngive and change in time, my absolute change in the number is not even close to being the same. If this was 15.6, I'd be like okay maybe there's\\na little bit of error here. Data that you collect in the real world is never going to be perfect. These are models that try to get us close to describing the data. But over here we keep multiplying it by a factor of roughly .8, roughly .8. Now you might be tempted\\nto immediately say, okay, well that means that C of t is going to be equal to\\nour initial temperature, 80 times a common ratio of 0.8 to the number of minutes that passed by. Now this is very tempting and it would be the case\\nif this was one minute and if this was two minutes but our change in temperature each time is our change in temperature\\neach time is two minutes so what we really should say is this is one way to think about it is that it takes two minutes to have a 0.8 change or to be multiplied by 0.8. So the real way to describe this would be t over two. Every two minutes when t is zero, we'd be at 80. After two minutes, we would take 80 times 0.8, which is what we got over here. After four minutes, it would be 80 times 0.8 squared. In fact, let's just verify that we feel pretty good about this. So if we had something like this. So t and C of t. So when t is zero, C of t is 80. When t is, well let me just do the\\nsame data that we have here. When t is two, we have 80 times, two over two is one so it's 80 times 0.8, which is pretty close to\\nwhat we have over here. When t is four, it would be 80 .0.8 squared which is pretty close to\\nwhat we have right over here. I can just calculate it for you. If I have .8 squared times 80, 51.2 Getting pretty close. This is a pretty good approximation. Pretty good model. So I'm liking this model. This isn't exactly one of the choices so how do we manipulate this a little bit? Well, we can remind ourselves that this is the same thing as 80 times 0.8 to the one half and then that to the t power. And what's .8 to the one half? So .8. That's the same thing as\\ntaking the square root of .8 It's roughly .89 So this is approximately 80 times 0.89 to the t power. And if you look at all of these choices, this one is pretty close to this. This model best fits the data, especially of the choices going, this is pretty close to the model that I just thought about. Now another way of doing it that might have been a little bit simpler. I like to do it this way because even if I didn't have choices, we would have gotten to\\nsomething reasonable. Another way to do it is to say okay, 80 is our initial state. All of these whether you're talking about exponential or linear models, start with 80 when t is equal to zero but it's clearly not a linear model because we're not changing by even roughly the same amount every time but it looks like every two minutes we're changing by a factor of .8 so we're going to have\\nan exponential model so you say okay, it will be\\none of these two choices. Now this one down here you could rule out because we're not changing\\nby a factor of 0.8 or 0.81 every minute. We're changing by a factor of 0.81 every two minutes so you could have ruled that one out and then you could have deduced to this right over here and you could have said, look, if I'm changing by a\\nfactor of .9 every minute then that would have been\\n.81 every two minutes which is pretty close to\\nwhat we're seeing here changing by a factor of about .8 or .81 every two minutes. So once again that's why\\nwe like that first choice. \",\n",
       " '13.1.1': '- [Sal] Let\\'s explore the\\nnotion of a polynomial. This seems like a very complicated word, but if you break it down\\nit\\'ll start to make sense, especially when we start to\\nsee examples of polynomials. The first part of this word, lemme underline it, we have poly. This comes from Greek, for many. You see poly a lot in\\nthe English language, referring to the notion\\nof many of something. In this case, it\\'s many nomials. Nomial comes from Latin, from\\nthe Latin nomen, for name. You could view this as many names. But in a mathematical context, it\\'s really referring to many terms. We\\'re gonna talk, in a little bit, about what a term really is. But to get a tangible sense\\nof what are polynomials and what are not polynomials,\\nlemme give you some examples. And then we could write some, maybe, more formal rules for them. So, an example of a polynomial could be 10x to the seventh power\\nminus nine x squared plus 15x to the third plus nine. This is a polynomial. Another example of a polynomial. Nine a squared minus five. Even if I just have one number, even if I were to just\\nwrite the number six, that can officially be\\nconsidered a polynomial. If I were to write seven\\nx squared minus three. Lemme do it another variable. Seven y squared minus three y plus pi, that, too, would be a polynomial. These are examples of polynomials. What are examples of things\\nthat are not polynomials? Well, if I were to\\nreplace the seventh power right over here with a\\nnegative seven power. If I were to write 10x to\\nthe negative seven power minus nine x squared plus 15x\\nto the third power plus nine, this would not be a polynomial. So I think you might\\nbe sensing a rule here for what makes something a polynomial. You have to have nonnegative powers of your variable in each of the terms. I just used that word,\\nterms, so lemme explain it, \\'cause it\\'ll help me explain\\nwhat a polynomial is. A polynomial is something that\\nis made up of a sum of terms. And so, for example, in\\nthis first polynomial, the first term is 10x to the seventh; the second term is\\nnegative nine x squared; the next term is 15x to the third; and then the last term, maybe you could say the\\nfourth term, is nine. You can see something. Let me underline these. These are all terms. This is a four-term\\npolynomial right over here. You could say: \"Hey, wait,\\nthis thing you wrote in red, \"this also has four terms.\" We have to put a few more rules for it to officially be a polynomial, especially a polynomial in one variable. Each of those terms are going to be made up of a coefficient. This is the thing that multiplies the variable to some power. So in this first term\\nthe coefficient is 10. Lemme write this word down, coefficient. It\\'s another fancy word,\\nbut it\\'s just a thing that\\'s multiplied, in this case, times the variable, which\\nis x to seventh power. The first coefficient is 10. The next coefficient. Actually, lemme be careful here, because the second coefficient\\nhere is negative nine. We are looking at coefficients. The third coefficient here is 15. You can view this fourth\\nterm, or this fourth number, as the coefficient because\\nthis could be rewritten as, instead of just writing as nine, you could write it as\\nnine x to the zero power. And then it looks a little bit\\nclearer, like a coefficient. So, in general, a polynomial is the sum of a finite number of\\nterms where each term has a coefficient, which I could represent with the letter A, being\\nmultiplied by a variable being raised to a\\nnonnegative integer power. So, this right over here is a coefficient. It can be, if we\\'re dealing... Well, I don\\'t wanna get too technical. Positive, negative number. Could be any real number. We have our variable. And then the exponent,\\nhere, has to be nonnegative. Nonnegative integer. So here, the reason\\nwhy what I wrote in red is not a polynomial is because here I have an exponent that is a negative integer. Let\\'s give some other examples of things that are not polynomials. So, if I were to change the second one to, instead of nine a squared, if I wrote it as nine a to\\nthe one half power minus five, this is not a polynomial\\nbecause this exponent right over here, it is\\nno longer an integer; it\\'s one half. This is the same thing as nine times the square root of a minus five. This also would not be a polynomial. Or, if I were to write nine\\na to the a power minus five, also not a polynomial\\nbecause here the exponent is a variable; it\\'s not\\na nonnegative integer. All of these are examples of polynomials. There\\'s a few more pieces of terminology that are valuable to know. Polynomial is a general term\\nfor one of these expression that has multiple terms, a finite number, so not an infinite number, and each of the terms has this form. But there\\'s more specific terms for when you have only one term or\\ntwo terms or three terms. When you have one term,\\nit\\'s called a monomial. This is a monomial. This is an example of a monomial, which we could write as six x to the zero. Another example of a monomial might be 10z to the 15th power. That\\'s also a monomial. Your coefficient could be pi. Pi. Whoops. Could be pi. So we could write pi times\\nb to the fifth power. Any of these would be monomials. So what\\'s a binomial? Binomial\\'s where you have two terms. Monomial, mono for one, one term. Binomial is you have two terms. This right over here is a binomial. Binomial. You have two terms. All these are polynomials but\\nthese are subclassifications. It\\'s a binomial; you have one, two terms. Another example of a binomial would be three y to the third plus five y. Once again, you have two terms that have this form right over here. You\\'ll also hear the term trinomial. Trinomial\\'s when you have three terms. Trinomial. This right over here is an example. This is the first term; this is the second term; and this is the third term. Now, the next word that\\nyou will hear often in the context with\\npolynomials is the notion of the degree of a polynomial. You might hear people say: \"What is the degree of a polynomial?\", or \"What is the degree of a\\ngiven term of a polynomial?\" Let\\'s start with the\\ndegree of a given term. Let\\'s go to this polynomial here. We have this first term,\\n10x to the seventh. The degree is the power that\\nwe\\'re raising the variable to. So this is a seventh-degree term. The second term is a second-degree term. The third term is a third-degree term. And you could view this constant term, which is really just nine,\\nyou could view that as, sometimes people say the constant term. Sometimes people will\\nsay the zero-degree term. If people are talking about the degree of the entire polynomial,\\nthey\\'re gonna say: \"What is the degree of the highest term? \"What is the term with\\nthe highest degree?\" That degree will be the degree\\nof the entire polynomial. So, this first polynomial, this is a seventh-degree polynomial. This one right over here is\\na second-degree polynomial because it has a second-degree term and that\\'s the highest-degree term. This right over here is a third-degree. You could even say third-degree binomial because its highest-degree\\nterm has degree three. If this said five y to the\\nseventh instead of five y, then it would be a\\nseventh-degree binomial. This right over here is\\na 15th-degree monomial. This is a second-degree trinomial. A few more things I will introduce you to is the idea of a leading term\\nand a leading coefficient. Lemme write this down. The notion of what it means to be leading. It can mean whatever is the\\nfirst term or the coefficient. If you\\'re saying leading\\nterm, it\\'s the first term. If you\\'re saying leading coefficient, it\\'s the coefficient in the first term. But it\\'s oftentimes associated with a polynomial being\\nwritten in standard form. Standard form. Standard form is where you write the\\nterms in degree order, starting with the highest-degree term. So, for example, what I have up here, this is not in standard form; because I do have the\\nhighest-degree term first, but then I should go to the next highest, which is the x to the third. But here I wrote x squared\\nnext, so this is not standard. If I wanted to write it in standard form, it would be 10x to the seventh power, which is the highest-degree\\nterm, has degree seven. Then, 15x to the third. So, plus 15x to the third, which\\nis the next highest degree. Then, negative nine x squared is the next highest degree term. And then, the lowest-degree\\nterm here is plus nine, or plus nine x to zero. Now this is in standard form. I have written the terms in\\norder of decreasing degree, with the highest degree first. Here, it\\'s clear that your leading term is 10x to the seventh,\\n\\'cause it\\'s the first one, and our leading coefficient\\nhere is the number 10. So, there was a lot in that video, but hopefully the notion of a polynomial isn\\'t seeming too\\nintimidating at this point. These are really useful\\nwords to be familiar with as you continue on on your math journey. ',\n",
       " '13.1.2': \"- [Instructor] We are told a\\nrectangle has a height of five and a width of 3x\\nsquared minus x plus two. Then we're told express the area of the entire rectangle, and the expression should be expanded. So pause this video and see if\\nyou could work through this. All right, now let's work\\nthrough this together. What this diagram is showing us is exactly an indicative rectangle, where its height is five and its width is 3x\\nsquared minus x plus two. What this shows us is is the area of the entire rectangle can be broken down into three smaller areas. You have this blue area right over here. Where the width is 3x\\nsquared, the height is five, so what's that area going to be? It's going to be the height times width. Five times 3x squared. That's the same thing as 15x squared. Now what about this purple\\narea right over here? It's going to be height times width again, so it'll be five times negative x, which is the same thing as negative 5x. I know what some of you are thinking, how can you have a width of negative x? Well, we don't know what x is, so this is all a little bit abstract. But you could imagine having\\nx be a negative value, in which case this actually\\nwould be a positive width. Another thing you might be saying is, hey, this magenta area,\\nwhen I just eyeball it, looks like it has a larger\\nwidth than this blue area. How do we know that? We don't. They're just showing this\\nas an indicative way. They might have actually the same width. They might have, one might\\nbe larger than the other, but this is just showing us that they're not necessarily the same. It's very abstract. It's definitely not drawn to scale 'cause we don't know what x is. All right, and then this last area is going to be the height, which is five, times the width, which is two. So that's just going to be equal to 10. So what we just saw is that\\nthe area of the whole thing is equal to the sum of these areas, and the sum of those areas is 15x squared plus negative 5x, or we could\\njust write that as minus 5x. And then we have plus 10. Now I know what some of you are thinking. If I know that the height is five and the width is this value, well couldn't I have\\njust multiplied height times the entire width, 3x\\nsquared minus x plus two, and then I would've just\\nnaturally distributed the five? And essentially that's\\nexactly what we did here. Area models, you might have first seen them in elementary school, really to understand the\\ndistributive property. So if you distribute the\\nfive you get 15x squared minus 5x plus 10. Same idea. Let's do another example. So here we're given another rectangle. It has a height of 2x. We see that right there. A width of 3x plus four. We see that over there. Express the area of the entire rectangle. So same drill. See if you can pause this video and work on this on your own. All right. Well, we can see that the height is 2x, the width in total is 3x plus four. But we can clearly see that\\nthe area of the entire thing can be broken up into this blue section and this magenta section. The blue section's area is 3x times 2x. So 3x times 2x, which\\nis equal to 6x squared. The magenta section is equal to width times height, its area. So that going to be equal to 8x. So the area of the whole thing is going to be the sum of these areas, which is going to be 6x squared plus 8x. And we're done. Once again, we could've\\njust thought about it as the height is 2x, we're gonna\\nmultiply it times the width, times 3x plus four. Then we just distribute the 2x. So 2x times 3x is 6x squared. 2x times four is 8x. Same idea. It's really just to\\nmake sure we understand that when we distribute a 2x\\nonto this 3x and this four, we can conceptualize it as figuring out the areas of the sub-parts\\nof the entire rectangle. \",\n",
       " '13.2.1': \"- [Voiceover] So I have this\\nbig rectangle here that's divided into four smaller\\nrectangles, and what I wanna do is I wanna express the\\narea of this larger rectangle and I wanna do it two ways. The first way I wanna\\nexpress it as the product of two binomials and\\nthen I wanna express it as a trinomial, so let's\\nthink about this a little bit. So one way to say well look,\\nthe height of this larger rectangle from here to here,\\nwe see that that distance is x, and then from here to here it's two, so the entire height right over here, the entire height right over\\nhere is going to be x plus two. So the height is x plus\\ntwo, and what's the width? Well the width is, we go\\nfrom there to there is x, and then from there to there is three, so the entire width is x plus three. x plus three. So just like that, I've\\nexpressed the area of the entire rectangle, and it's\\nthe product of two binomials. But now let's express it as a trinomial. Well to do that, we can\\nbreak down the larger area into the areas of each of\\nthese smaller rectangles. So what's the area of this\\npurple rectangle right over here? Well the purple rectangle, its height is x and its width is x, so\\nits area is x squared. Let me write that, that's x squared. What's the area of this yellow rectangle? Well it's height is x, same\\nheight as right over here, its height is x and its width is three, so it's gonna be x times three, or 3x. It'll have an area of 3x. So that area is 3x, if\\nwe're summing up the area of the entire thing,\\nthis would be plus 3x. So this expression right\\nover here, that's the area of this purple region, plus\\nthe area of this yellow region, and then we can move on\\nto this green region. What's the area going to be here? Well the height is two and the width is x, so multiply height times\\nwidth is gonna be two times x, and we can just add\\nthat, plus two times x, and then finally this\\nlittle grey box here. Its height is two, we see\\nthat right over there, its height is two, and its width is three, we see it right over there,\\nso it has an area of six. Two times three. So plus six, and you might say\\nwell this isn't a trinomial, this has four terms right over here, but you might notice that we can add, that we can add these middle two terms, 3x plus 2x, if I have three\\nx's and I add two x's to that, I'm gonna have five x's. So this entire thing\\nsimplifies to x squared, x squared plus 5x plus six. Plus six. So this and this are two\\nways of expressing the area, so they're going to be\\nequal, and that makes sense 'cause if you multiply\\nit out, these binomials, and simplify it, you\\nwould get this trinomial, and we can do that really fast. You multiply the x times the\\nx, actually let me do that in the same colors. You multiply the x times the x, you get the x squared. You multiply this x times the three, you get your 3x. You multiply the two times the x, you get your 2x. And then you multiply\\nthe two times the three and you get your six. So what this, I guess you\\ncan say this area model does for us is it hopefully\\nmakes a visual representation of why it makes sense to\\nmultiply binomials the way we do, and in other videos we talk\\nabout it as applying the distribution property\\ntwice, but this gives you a more visual representation for why it actually makes sense. \",\n",
       " '13.2.2': \"- [Voiceover] Let's see\\nif we can figure out the product of x minus\\nfour and x plus seven. And we want to write that product\\nin standard quadratic form which is just a fancy way of saying a form where you have some coefficient\\non the second degree term, a x squared plus some coefficient b on the first degree term\\nplus the constant term. So this right over here would\\nbe standard quadratic form. So that's the form that we\\nwant to express this product in and encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. Alright, now let's work through this. And the key when we're multiplying\\ntwo binomials like this, or actually when you're\\nmultiplying any polynomials, is just to remember the\\ndistributive property that we all by this point know quite well. So what we could view this is as is we could distribute this x minus four, this entire expression\\nover the x and the seven. So we could say that\\nthis is the same thing as x minus four times x plus x minus four times seven. So let's write that. So x minus four times x,\\nor we could write this as x times x minus four. That's distributing, or multiplying\\nthe x minus four times x that's right there. Plus seven times x minus four. Times x minus four. Notice all we did is\\ndistribute the x minus four. We took this whole thing\\nand we multiplied it by each term over here. We multiplied x by x minus four and we multiplied seven by x minus four. Now, we see that we have these, I guess you can call\\nthem two seperate terms. And to simplify each of them,\\nor to multiply them out, we just have to distribute. In this first we're going to\\nhave to distribute this blue x. And over here we have to\\ndistribute this blue seven. So let's do that. So here we can say x times\\nx is going to be x squared. X times, we have a negative here, so we can say negative four is\\ngoing to be negative four x. And just like, that we get\\nx squared minus four x. And then over here we have seven times x so that's going to be plus seven x. And then we have seven\\ntimes the negative four which is negative 28. And we are almost done. We can simplify it a little bit more. We have two first degree terms here. If I have negative four xs\\nand to that I add seven xs, what is that going to be? Well those two terms together, these two terms together are going to be negative four plus seven xs. Negative four plus, plus seven. Negative four plus seven xs. So all I'm doing here,\\nI'm making it very clear that I'm adding these two coefficients, and then we have all of the other terms. We have the x squared. X squared plus this and then we have, and then we have the minus, and then we have the minus 28. And we're at the home stretch! This would simply to x squared. Now negative four plus seven is three, so this is going to be plus three x. That's what these two middle\\nterms simplify to, to three x. And then we have minus 28. Minus 28. And just like that, we are done! And a fun thing to think about,\\nsince it's in the same form. If we were to compare a is one, b is three, and c is -28, but it's interesting here\\nto look at the pattern when we multiplied these two binomials. Especially these two binomials\\nwhere the coefficient on the x term was a one. Notice we have x times x, that what actually forms the\\nx squared term over here. We have negative four, let\\nme do this in a new color. We have negative four times,\\nthat's not a new color. We have, we have negative four times seven, which is going to be negative 28. And then how did we get this middle term? How did we get this three x? Well, you had the negative\\nfour x plus the seven x. Or the negative four\\nplus the seven times x. You had the negative four plus the seven, plus the seven times x. So I hope you see a little\\nbit of a pattern here. If you're multiplying two binomials where the coefficients on\\nthe x term are both one. It's going to be x squared. And then the last term, the constant term, is going to be the product\\nof these two constants. Negative four and seven. And then the first degree\\nterm right over here, it's coefficient is going to be the sum of these two constants,\\nnegative four and seven. Now this might, you could do this pattern if you practice it. It's just something that will help you multiply binomials a little bit faster. But it's super important that you realize where this came from. This came from nothing more than applying the distributive property twice. \",\n",
       " '13.2.3': \"Multiply (3x+2) by (5x-7). So we are multiplying two binomials. I am actually going to show you two really equivalent ways of doing this. One that you might hear in a classroom and it is kind of a more mechanical memorizing way of doing it which might be faster but you really don't know what you are doing and then there is the one where you are essentially just applying something what you already know and kind of a logical way. So I will first do the memorizing way that you might be exposed to and they'll use something called FOIL. So let me write this down here. So you can immediately see that whenever someone gives you a new mnemonic to memorize, that you are doing something pretty mechanical. So FOIL literally stands for First Outside, let me write it this way.....F O I L where the F in FOIL stands for First, the O in FOIL stand for Outside, the I stands for Inside and then the L stands for Last. The reason why I don't like these things is that when you are 35 years old, you are not going to remember what FOIL stood for and then you are not going to remember how to multiply this binomial. But lets just apply FOIL. So First says just multiply the first terms in each of these binomials. So just multiply the 3x times the 5x. So (3x. 5x). The Outside part tells us to multiply the outside terms. So in this case, you have 3x on the outside and you have -7 on the outside. So that is +3x(-7). The inside, well the inside terms here are 2 and 5x. So, (+2.5x) and then finally you have the last terms. You have the 2 and the -7. So the last terms are 2 times -7. 2(-7). So what you are essentially doing is just making sure that you are multipying each term by every other term here. What we are essentially doing is multiplying, doing the distributive property twice. We are multiplying the 3x times (5x-7). So 3x times (5x-7) is (3x . 5x) plus (3x - 7). And we are multiplying the 2 times (5x-7) to give us these terms. But anyway, lets just multiply these out just to get our answer. 3x times 5x is same thing as (3 times 5) ( x times x) which is the same thing as 15x square. You can just do this x to the first time to x to the first. You multiply the x to get x squared. 3 times 5 is 15. This term right here 3 times -7 is -21 and then you have your x right over here. And then you have this term which is 2 times 5 which is 10 times x. So +10x. And then finally you have this term here in blue. 2 times -7 is -14. And we aren't done yet, we can simplify this a little bit. We have two like terms here. We have this...let me find a new color. We have 2 terms with a x to the first power or just an x term right over here. So we have -21 of something and you add 10 or in another way, you have 10 of something and you subtract 21 of them, you are going to have -11 of that something. We put the other terms here, you have 15... 15x squared and then you have your -14 and we are done. Now I said I would show you another way to do it. I want to show you why the distributive property can get us here without having to memorize FOIL. So the distributive property tells us that if we 're... look if we are multipying something times an expression, you just have to multiply times every term in the expression. So we can distribute, we can distribute the 5x onto the 3..., or actually we could...well, let me view it this way... we could distribute the 5x-7, this whole thing onto the 3x+2. Let me just change the order since we are used to distributing something from the left. So this is the same thing as (5x-7)(3x+2). I just swapped the two expressions. And we can distribute this whole thing times each of these terms. Now what happens if I take (5x-7) times 3x? Well, thats just going to be 3x times (5x-7). So I have just distributed the 5x-7 times 3x and to that I am going to add 2 times 5x-7. I have just distributed the 5x-7 onto the 2. Now, you can do the distributive property again. We can distribute the 3x onto the 5x. We can distribute the 3x onto the 5x. And we can distribute the 3x onto the -7. We can distribute the 2 onto the 5x, over here and we can distribute the 2 on that -7. Now if we do it like this what do we get ? 3x times 5x, that's this right over here. If we do 3x times -7, that's this term right over here. If you do 2 times 5x, that's this term right over here. If you do 2 times -7, that is this term right over here. So we got the exact same result that we got with FOIL. Now, FOIL can be faster if you just wanted to do it and kind of skip to this step. I think its important that you know that this is how it actually works. Just in case you do forget this when you are 35 or 45 years old and you are faced with multiplying binomial, you just have to remember the distributive property. \",\n",
       " '13.3.1': \"- [Voiceover] Let's see\\nif we can figure out what x plus three times x minus three is, and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can work this out. Well, one way to tackle\\nit is the way that we've always tackled it when\\nwe multiply binomials, is just apply the\\ndistributive property twice. So first we can take this\\nentire yellow x plus three and multiply times each\\nof these two terms. So first we can multiply it times this x. So that's going to be\\nx times x plus three. And then we are going to multiply it times, we can\\nsay, this negative three. So we could write minus three times, now that's going to be multiplied by x plus three again. And then we apply the\\ndistributive property one more time. Where we take this magenta x and we distribute it across this x plus three so x times x is x squared, x times three is three x, and then we do it on this side. Negative three times x is negative three x and negative three times three is negative nine. And what does this simplify to? Well, we're gonna get x squared, and we have three x and minus three x so these two characters cancel out, and we are just left with x squared minus nine. And you might see a little pattern here, notice I added three and\\nthen I subtracted three and I got this, I got the x squared and then if you take three and multiply it by negative three, you are going to get a negative nine. And notice, the middle terms canceled out. And one thing you might ask is, well, will that always be the case, if we add a number and we subtract that same number like that? And we could try it out. Let's talk in general terms. So if we, instead of doing x plus three times x minus three, we could write this same thing as, instead of three, let's just say you have x plus a times x minus a. And I encourage you to pause this video and work it all out, just assume a is some number, like three or some other number, and apply the distributive property\\ntwice and see what you get. Well, let's work through it. So first we can distribute\\nthis yellow x plus a onto the x and the negative a. So x plus a times x, or we could say x times x plus a, that's going to be x times x plus a, and then we're going to have minus a, or this negative\\na, times x plus a. So minus, and then we're gonna have this minus a times x, plus a. Notice, all I did is I distributed this yellow, I distributed this big chunk of this expression, I just distributed it onto the x and onto this negative a. I'm multiplying it times the x and I'm multiplying it by the negative a. And now we can apply the\\ndistributive property again. X times x is x squared, x times a is ax, and then we get negative a times x is negative ax, and then negative a times a, is negative a squared. And notice, regardless of my choice of a, I'm going to have ax and then minus ax. So this is always going to cancel out. It didn't just work for\\nthe case when a was three. For any a, if I have a times x and then I subtract a times x, that's\\njust going to cancel out. So this is just going to cancel out, and what are we going to be left with? We are going to be left with x squared minus a squared. And you can view this as a special case. When you have something, x plus something, times x minus that same something, it's going to be x squared minus that something squared. And this is a good one to know in general. And we could use it to quickly figure out the products of other binomials that fit this pattern here. So if I were to say, quick, what is x plus 10, times x minus 10? Well, you could say, all right this fits the pattern, it's x plus a times x minus a, so it's going to be x\\nsquared minus a squared. If a is 10, a squared is going to be 100. So you can do it really quick once you recognize the pattern. \",\n",
       " '13.3.2': \"- [Voiceover] Let's see\\nif we can figure out what x plus seven, let me write\\nthat a little bit neater, x plus seven squared is. And I encourage you to pause the video and work through it on your own. Alright, now let's work\\nthrough this together. So we just have to remember, we're squaring the entire binomial. So this thing is going\\nto be the same thing as: x plus seven times x plus seven. I'm gonna write the second x plus seven in a different color, which is going to be helpful when we actually multiply things out. When we see it like this, then we can multiply these out the way we would multiply any binomials. And I'll first do it\\nthe, I guess you can say, the slower way, but\\nthe more intuitive way, applying the distributive property twice. And then we'll think\\nabout maybe some shortcuts or some patterns we might\\nbe able to recognize, especially when we are squaring binomials. So let's start with just applying the distributive property twice. So let's distribute\\nthis yellow x plus seven over this magenta x plus seven. So we can multiply it by\\nthe x, this magenta x, so it's going to be x, let\\nme do it in that same color. So it's going to be magenta x times x plus seven plus magenta seven times yellow x plus seven. X plus seven, and now we can apply the distributive property again. We can take this magenta x and distribute it over the x plus seven. So x times x is x-squared. X times seven is seven x. And then we can do it again over here. This seven, let me do\\nit in a different color, so this seven times that x is going to be plus another seven x and then the seven times the seven is going to be 49. And we're in the home stretch.\\nWe can then simplify it. This is going to be x-squared and then these two middle\\nterms we can add together. Seven x, let me do this in orange, seven x plus seven x is going to be 14 x plus 14 x plus 49. Plus 49. And we're done. Now the key question is do\\nwe see some patterns here? Do we see some patterns\\nthat we can generalize and that might help us square binomials a little bit faster in the future? Well, when we first looked at\\njust multiplying binomials, we saw a pattern like x plus a times x plus b is going to be equal to x-squared, let me write it this way, is going to be equal to x-squared plus a plus b x plus b-squared. And so, if both a and\\nb are the same thing, we can say that x plus a times x plus a is going to be equal to x-squared, and this is the case when we have a coefficient of one on both\\nof these x's, x-squared's. Now in this case, a and b are both a. So it's going to be a plus a times x, or we can just say plus two a x. Let me be clear what I just did. Instead of writing a plus b, I can just view this as a plus a times x, and then plus a-squared, or that's the same thing as x-squared plus two a x plus a-squared. This is a general way of expressing a squared binomial like this. A squared binomial where the coefficients on both x's are one. We can see that's exactly\\nwhat we saw over here. In this, in the example\\nwe did, seven is our a. So we got x-squared right\\nover there let me circle it. So we have this blue x-squared that corresponds to that over there. And then seven is our a, so two a x , two times seven is 14 x. Notice we have the 14 x right over there. So this 14 x corresponds to two a x, and then finally if a is seven, a-squared is 49. A-squared is 49. So in general if you are\\nsquaring a binomial, you could, a fast way of doing it is\\nto do this pattern here, and we can do another example real fast, just to make sure that\\nwe've understood things. If I were to tell you what is x minus, I'll throw a negative in here, x minus three squared, I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Think about expressing\\nthis using this pattern. Well this is going to\\nbe, in this case our a, we have to be careful, our a is going to be negative three, so that is our a right over there. So this is going to be equal to x-squared. Now two a x, let me do it\\nin the same colors actually, just for fun. So it's going to be x-squared. Now what is two times a times x? A is negative three, so two\\ntimes a is negative six. So it's going to be negative six x. So, minus six x, that's two\\ntimes a is the coefficient. And then we have our x there. And then plus a-squared. Well if a is negative three, what is negative three\\ntimes negative three? It's going to be positive nine. And just like that, when\\nwe looked at this pattern, we were able to very quickly figure out what this binomial squared actually is. And I encourage you, you can do it again, with applying the\\ndistributive property twice to verify that this is\\nindeed the same thing as x minus three squared. \",\n",
       " '13.3.3': \"Find the product 2x\\nplus 8 times 2x minus 8. So we're multiplying\\ntwo binomials. So you could use FOIL,\\nyou could just straight up use the distributive\\nproperty here. But the whole point of\\nthis problem, I'm guessing, is to see whether you\\nrecognize a pattern here. This is of the form a\\nplus b times a minus b, where here a\\nis 2x and b is 8. We have 2x plus 8 and then 2x\\nminus 8. a plus b, a minus b. What I want to do\\nis I'm just going to multiply this out for us. And then just see what happens. Whenever you have this pattern,\\nwhat the product actually looks like. So if you were to\\nmultiply this out, we can distribute the a plus b. We could distribute\\nthis whole thing. Distribute the whole\\na plus b on the a and then distribute it on the b. And I could have done this\\nwith this problem right here, and it would have taken us\\nless time to just solve it. But I want to find out\\nthe general pattern here. So a plus b times a. So we have a times a plus\\nb, that's this times this. And then a plus b\\ntimes negative b, that's negative\\nb times a plus b. So I've done distributive\\nproperty once, now I could do it again. I can distribute the a\\nonto the a and this b and it gives me a squared. a times a is a squared,\\nplus a times b, which is ab. And now I can do it\\nwith the negative b. Negative b times a is negative\\nab or negative ba, same thing. And negative b times b\\nis negative b squared. Now, what does this simplify to? Well, I have an ab, and\\nthen I'm subtracting an ab. So these two guys\\ncancel out and I am just left with a squared\\nminus b squared. So the general pattern,\\nand this is a good one to just kind of\\nknow super fast, is that a plus b times\\na minus b is always going to be a squared\\nminus b squared. So we have an a plus\\nb times an a minus b. So this product is\\ngoing to be a squared. So it's going to be\\n2x squared minus b squared minus 8 squared. 2x squared, that's\\nthe same thing as 2 squared times x\\nsquared, or 4x squared. And from that, we're\\nsubtracting 8 squared. So it's going to be\\n4x squared minus 64. \",\n",
       " '13.3.4': \"We're asked to simply, or expand (7x + 10) ^ 2 Now the first thing I will show you is exactly what you should NOT do, well there's this huge temptation. A lot of people will look at this and say oh, that's (7x)^2 + 10^2. This is WRONG. And I'll write it in caps. This is WRONG! What your brain is doing is thinking if I had 7x times 10 and I squared that, this would be (7x)^2 times 10^2. We aren't multiplying here, we're adding 7x to 10. So you can't just square each of these terms. I just wanted to highlight, this is completely wrong, and to see why it's wrong, you have to remind yourself that (7x + 10)^2 is the exact same thing as (7x + 10)(7x + 10). That's what it means to square something. You're multiplying it by itself twice here. So this is what it is, so we're really just multiplying a binomial, or two binomials, they just happen to be the same one, and you could use F.O.I.L., you could use the distributive method, but this is actually a special case: when you're squaring a binomial, so let's just think about it as a special case first then we can apply whatever we learn to this. So we could've just done it straight here, but I want to learn the general case so you can apply it to any problem that you might see. If I have (a+b) squared We already realised that it's not a squared plus b squared That is a plus b times a plus b. and now we can use the distributive property We can distribute this a + b times this a So we get, we get a times a plus b and we can distribute the a plus b times this b plus b times a plus b, and we distribute this a we get a squared plus ab plus b times a is another ab And I'm just swapping the order so it's the same as this. plus b times b which is b squared. These are the same or these are like terms. So we can add them. One of something plus another of that something will give you two of that something. 2 ab. We have a squared plus 2 ab plus b squared. So the pattern here, the pattern here, if I have a plus b squared it's equal to a squared plus 2 times the product of these numbers plus b squared. So over here I have seven x plus ten squared So this is going to be equal to seven x squared seven x squared plus 2 times the product of seven x and 10. 2 times seven x times 10 plus 10 squared. So, the difference between the right answer and the wrong answer is that you have this middle term here that you might have forgotten about if you did it this way. And this comes out when you are multiplying all the different combinations of the terms here. if we simplify this, if we simplify seven x squared That's seven squared times x squared. So seven squared is 49 times x squared When you multiply this part out 2 times 7 times 10 which is 140 and then we have our x. No other x there. And then plus 10 squared. So plus 100. And we are done. \",\n",
       " '13.4.1': \"- [Voiceover] You're probably\\nfamiliar with the general term factor. So if I were to say: What\\nare the factors of 12, you could say: Well what\\nare the whole numbers that I can multiply by another\\nwhole number to get 12? So for examples, you\\ncould say things like, well I could multiply\\none times 12 to get 12. So you could say that\\none is a factor of 12. You could even say that\\n12 is a factor of 12. You could say two times\\nsix is equal to 12, so you could say that\\ntwo is a factor of 12 and that six is also a factor of 12. And of course three times four is also 12, so both three and four are factors of 12. So if you said well what\\nare the factors of 12 and you've seen this\\nbefore, well you could say: one, two, three, four, six, and 12, those are all factors of 12. And you could also phase\\nit the other way around, so let me just give an example. So if I were to pick on\\nthree, I could say that three is a factor of 12. Or to phrase it slightly\\ndifferently, I could say that 12 is divisible, 12 is divisible by three. Now what I wanna do in this\\nvideo is extend this idea of being a factor or divisibility\\ninto the algebraic world. So for example, if I were to take 3xy. So this is a monomial with\\nan integer coefficient. Three is an integer right over here. And if I were to multiply\\nit with another monomial with an integer coefficient, I don't know, let's say times negative two X squared, Y to the third power, what is this going to be equal to? Well this would be equal to, if we multiply the coefficients,\\nthree times negative two is going to be negative six. X times X squared is X to the third power. And then Y times Y to the third is Y to the fourth power. And so what we could say is,\\nif we wanted to say factors of negative six X to the\\nthird, Y to the fourth, we could say that 3xy is a factor of this just as an example; so\\nlet me write that down. We could write that 3xy is a factor of, is a factor of... of negative six X to the\\nthird power, Y to the fourth, or we could phrase that\\nthe other way around. We could say that negative\\nsix X to the third, Y to the fourth, is divisible by, is divisible by 3xy. So hopefully you're seeing the parallels. If I'm taking these two monomials\\nwith integer coefficients and I multiply 'em and I get\\nthis other, in this case, this other monomial, I could\\nsay that either one of these and there's actually\\nother factors of this, but I could say either\\none of these is a factor of this monomial, or we\\ncould say that negative six X to the third, Y to the four is divisible by one of its factors. And we could even extend this\\nto binomials or polynomials. For example, if I were to take, if I were to take, let me scroll down a little bit, whoops, if I were to take, let me say X plus three and I wanted to multiply it times X plus seven, we know that this is going to be equal to, if I were to write it as a trinomial, it's gonna be X times X, so X squared, and then it's gonna be\\nthree X plus seven X, so plus 10x; and if any\\nof this looks familiar, we have a lot of videos\\nwhere we go in detail of multiplying binomials like this. And then three times seven is 21. Plus 21. So because I multiplied these\\ntwo, in this case binomials, or we could consider\\nthemselves to be polynomials, polynomials or binomials\\nwith integer coefficients. Notice the coefficients\\nhere, they're one, one. The constants here, they're all integers. Because I'm dealing with all\\nintegers here, we could say that either one of these\\nbinomials is a factor of this trinomial, or we could say this\\ntrinomial is divisible by either one of these. So let me write that down. So I could say, I'll just\\npick on X plus seven. We could say that X plus seven is a factor, is a factor of X squared plus 10x plus 21; or we could say that X squared plus 10x plus 21 is divisible by, is divisible by I could say X plus three\\nor I could say X plus seven is divisible by, X plus seven. And the key is, is that\\nboth of these binomials, or even if we were\\ndealing with polynomials, we are dealing with\\nthings that have integer, we're dealing with things that\\nhave integer coefficients. \",\n",
       " '13.4.2': \"What I want to do is start with\\nan expression like 4x plus 18 and see if we can rewrite\\nthis as the product of two expressions. Essentially, we're going\\nto try to factor this. And the key here\\nis to figure out are there any common\\nfactors to both 4x and 18? And we can factor that\\ncommon factor out. We're essentially\\ngoing to be reversing the distributive property. So for example, what\\nis the largest number that is-- or I could really say\\nthe largest expression-- that is divisible into\\nboth 4x and 18? Well, 4x is divisible\\nby 2, because we know that 4 is divisible by 2. And 18 is also\\ndivisible by 2, so we can rewrite 4x as\\nbeing 2 times 2x. If you multiply that side,\\nit's obviously going to be 4x. And then, we can write 18 as\\nthe same thing as 2 times 9. And now it might\\nbe clear that when you apply the\\ndistributive property, you'll usually end\\nup with a step that looks something like this. Now we're just going to\\nundistribute the two right over here. We're going to\\nfactor the two out. Let me actually just draw that. So we're going to\\nfactor the two out, and so this is going to\\nbe 2 times 2x plus 9. And if you were to-- wanted\\nto multiply this out, it would be 2 times\\n2x plus 2 times 9. It would be exactly\\nthis, which you would simplify as\\nthis, right up here. So there we have it. We have written\\nthis as the product of two expressions,\\n2 times 2x plus 9. Let's do this again. So let's say that I\\nhave 12 plus-- let me think of something\\ninteresting-- 32x. Actually since we-- just to get\\na little bit of variety here, let's put a y here, 12 plus 32y. Well, what's the\\nlargest number that's divisible into both 12 and 32? 2 is clearly divisible\\ninto both, but so is 4. And let's see. It doesn't look like\\nanything larger than 4 is divisible into\\nboth 12 and 32. The greatest common\\nfactor of 12 and 32 is 4, and y is only divisible\\ninto the second term, not into this first\\nterm right over here. So it looks like 4 is the\\ngreatest common factor. So we could rewrite each\\nof these as a product of 4 and something else. So for example, 12, we\\ncan rewrite as 4 times 3. And 32, we can\\nrewrite-- since it's going to be plus-- 4 times. Well if you divide 32y by\\n4, it's going to be 8y. And now once again, we\\ncan factor out the 4. So this is going to\\nbe 4 times 3 plus 8y. And once you do more and\\nmore examples of this, you're going to find\\nthat you can just do this stuff all at once. You can say hey, what's\\nthe largest number that's divisible into both of these? Well, it's 4, so let\\nme factor a 4 out. 12 divided by 4 is 3. 32y divided by 4 is 8y. \",\n",
       " '13.5.1': \"- [Voiceover] So we have a\\nquadratic expression here. X squared minus three x minus 10. And what I'd like to do in this video is I'd like to factor it as\\nthe product of two binomials. Or to put it another way, I want to write it as\\nthe product x plus a, that's one binomial, times x plus b, where we need to figure out\\nwhat a and b are going to be. So I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure\\nout what a and b need to be. Can we rewrite this\\nexpression as the product of two binomials where\\nwe know what a and b are? So let's work through this together now. I'll highlight a and\\nb in different colors. I'll put a in yellow and\\nI'll put b in magenta. So one way to think about\\nit is let's just multiply these two binomials using a and b, and we've done this in previous videos. You might want to review\\nmultiplying binomials if any of this looks strange to you. But if you were to multiply what we have on the right-hand side\\nout it would be equal to, you're going to have the x times the x which is going to be x squared. Then you're going to\\nhave the a times the x, which is ax. And then you're going to\\nhave the b times the x, which is bx. Actually just let me, I'm\\nnot gonna skip any steps here just to see it this time. This is all review, or should be review. So then we have, so we did\\nx times x to get x squared. Then we have a times x\\nto get ax, to get a x. And then we're gonna have x times b, so we're multiplying each\\nterm times every other term. So then we have x times b to get bx. So plus bx. b x. And then finally we have\\nplus the a times the b, which is of course going to be ab. And now we can simplify this, and you might have been\\nable to go straight to this if you are familiar with\\nmultiplying binomials. This would be x squared plus, we can add these two coefficients because they're both on\\nthe first degree terms, they're both multiplied by x. If I have ax's and I add bx's to that I'm going to have a plus b x's. So let me write that down. a plus b x's, and then\\nfinally I have the plus, I'll do that blue color,\\nfinally I have it. I have plus ab. Plus ab. And now we can use this to think about what a and b need to be. If we do a little bit of pattern matching, we see we have an x squared there, we have an x squared there. We have something times x, in this case it's a\\nnegative three times x. And here we have something times x. So one way to think about it is that a plus b needs to be\\nequal to negative three. They need to add up to\\nbe this coefficient. So let me write that down. So we have a plus b needs to\\nbe equal to negative three. And we're not done yet. We finally look at this last\\nterm, we have a times b. Well a times b needs to\\nbe equal to negative 10. So let's write that down. So we have a times b needs\\nto be equal to negative 10. And in general, whenever\\nyou're factoring something, a quadratic expression that has\\na one on second degree term, so it has a one coefficient\\non the x squared, you don't even see it but\\nit's implicitly there. You could write this as one x squared. A way to factor it is to\\ncome up with two numbers that add up to the coefficient\\non the first degree term, so two numbers that add\\nup to negative three. And if I multiply those same two numbers, I'm going to get negative 10. So two numbers that add\\nup to negative three, to add up to the coefficient here. And now when I multiply it,\\nI get the constant term. I get this right over here. Two numbers when I\\nmultiply I get negative 10. Well what could those numbers be? Well since when you multiply\\nthem we get a negative number, we know that they're going\\nto have different signs. And so let's see how we\\ncould think about it. And since when we add them\\nwe get a negative number, we know that the negative\\nnumber must be the larger one. So if I were to just factor 10, 10 you could do that as one times ten, or two times five. And two and five are interesting because if one of them are negative, their difference is three. So if one is negative... So let's see if we're\\ntalking about negative 10, you could say negative two times five. And when you multiply them\\nyou do get negative 10. But if you add these two, you're going to get positive three. But what if you went positive\\ntwo times negative five. Now this is interesting because still when you multiply them\\nyou get negative 10. And when you add them,\\ntwo plus negative five is going to be negative three. So we have just figured\\nout our two numbers. We could say that a is two or\\nwe could say that b is two, but I'll just say that a is equal to two and b is equal to negative five. And so our original expression, we can rewrite as, so we can rewrite x squared\\nminus three x minus 10. We can say that that\\nis going to be equal to x plus two times x, instead\\nof saying plus negative five which we could say, we could just say, actually let me write that down. I could write just plus\\nnegative five right over there because that's our b. I could just write x minus\\nfive, and we're done. We've just factored it as\\na product of two binomials. Now, I did it fairly involved mainly so you see where all this came from. But in the future whenever you\\nsee a quadratic expression, and you have a one coefficient on the second degree term right over here, you could say alright well I\\nneed to figure out two numbers that add up to the coefficient\\non the first degree term, on the x term, and those same two numbers when I multiply them need to\\nbe equal to this constant term, need to be equal to negative 10. You say okay well let's see, they're gonna be different signs because when I multiply them\\nI get a negative number. The negative one is\\ngonna be the larger one, since when I add them I\\ngot a negative number. So let's see, let's say five\\nand two seem interesting. Well negative five and positive two, when you add them you're\\ngonna get negative three, when you multiply them\\nyou get negative 10. \",\n",
       " '13.5.2': \"To better understand how\\nwe can factor second degree expressions like this, I'm going\\nto go through some examples. We'll factor this expression and\\nwe'll factor this expression. And hopefully it'll\\ngive you a background on how you could generally\\nfactor expressions like this. And to think about\\nit, let's think about what happens if I were\\nto multiply x plus something times x plus something else. Well, if I were to multiply\\nthis out, what do I get? Well, you're going to get\\nx squared plus ax plus bx, which is the same thing as\\na plus bx plus a times b. So if you wanted to go\\nfrom this form, which is what we have in these\\ntwo examples, back to this, you really just have\\nto think about well, what's our coefficient\\non our x term, and can I figure out two numbers\\nthat when I take their sum, are equal to that coefficient,\\nand what's my constant term, and can I think of two numbers,\\nthose same two numbers, that when I take the product\\nequal that constant term? So let's do that over here. If we look at our\\ncoefficient on x, can we think of\\nan a plus ab that is equal to that\\nnumber negative 14? And can we think\\nof the same a and b that if we were to\\ntake its product, it would be equal to 40? So what's an a and a b\\nthat would work over here? Well, let's think about\\nthis a little bit. If I have 4 times 10\\nis 40, but 4 plus 10 is equal to positive 14. So that wouldn't quite work. What happens if we make\\nthem both negative? If we have negative\\n4 plus negative 10, well that's going to be\\nequal to negative 14. And negative 4 times\\nnegative 10 is equal to 40. The fact that this number\\nright over here is positive, this number right\\nover here is positive, tells you that these are\\ngoing to be the same sign. If this number right\\nover here was negative, then we would have\\ndifferent signs. And so if you have\\n2 numbers that are going to be the same\\nsign and they add up to a negative number,\\nthen that tells you that they're both\\ngoing to be negative. So just going back\\nto this, we know that a is going to be negative\\n4, b is equal to negative 10, and we are done factoring it. We can factor this expression\\nas x plus negative 4 times x plus negative 10. Or another way to\\nwrite that, that's x minus 4 times x minus 10. Now let's do the\\nsame thing over here. Can we think of\\nan a plus b that's equal to the coefficient\\non the x term? Well, the coefficient\\non the x term here is essentially\\nnegative 1 times x. So we could say the\\ncoefficient is negative 1. And can we think of\\nan a times b where it's going to be\\nequal to negative 12? Well, let's think about\\nthis a little bit. The product of the 2\\nnumbers is negative, so that means that they\\nhave different signs. So one will be positive\\nand one will be negative. And so when I add the two\\ntogether, I get to negative 1. Well, just think about the\\nfactors of negative 12. Well, what about if one is 3\\nand maybe one is negative 4. Well, that seems to work. And you really just have\\nto try these numbers out. If a is 3 plus\\nnegative 4, that indeed turns out to be negative 1. And if we have 3\\ntimes negative 4, that indeed is equal\\nto negative 12. So that seems to work out. And it's really a matter\\nof trial and error. You could try negative\\n3 plus 4, but then that wouldn't have worked\\nout over here. You could have\\ntried two and six, but that wouldn't have\\nworked out on this number. Or 2 and negative\\n6, you wouldn't have gotten the sum to\\nbe equal to negative 1. But now that we've figured\\nout what the a and b are, what is this\\nexpression factored? Well, it's going to be x plus\\n3 times x plus negative 4, or we could say x minus 4. \",\n",

Well, we have a little bit\\nof experience doing this. This will be x times x, which is\\nx squared, plus x times b, which is bx, plus a times x,\\nplus a times b-- plus ab. Or if we want to add these two\\nin the middle right here, because they're both\\ncoefficients of x. We could right this as x squared\\nplus-- I can write it as b plus a, or a plus\\nb, x, plus ab. So in general, if we assume that\\nthis is the product of two binomials, we see that this\\nmiddle coefficient on the x term, or you could say the\\nfirst degree coefficient there, that's going to be\\nthe sum of our a and b. And then the constant term is\\ngoing to be the product of our a and b. Notice, this would map\\nto this, and this would map to this. And, of course, this is the\\nsame thing as this. So can we somehow pattern\\nmatch this to that? Is there some a and b where\\na plus b is equal to 10? And a times b is equal to 9? Well, let's just think about\\nit a little bit. What are the factors of 9? What are the things that a\\nand b could be equal to? And we're assuming that\\neverything is an integer. And normally when we're\\nfactoring, especially when we're beginning to factor,\\nwe're dealing with integer numbers. So what are the factors of 9? They're 1, 3, and 9. So this could be a 3 and a 3,\\nor it could be a 1 and a 9. Now, if it's a 3 and a 3, then\\nyou'll have 3 plus 3-- that doesn't equal 10. But if it's a 1 and a\\n9, 1 times 9 is 9. 1 plus 9 is 10. So it does work. So a could be equal to 1, and\\nb could be equal to 9. So we could factor this\\nas being x plus 1, times x plus 9. And if you multiply these two\\nout, using the skills we developed in the last few\\nvideos, you'll see that it is indeed x squared plus\\n10x, plus 9. So when you see something like\\nthis, when the coefficient on the x squared term, or the\\nleading coefficient on this quadratic is a 1, you can just\\nsay, all right, what two numbers add up to this\\ncoefficient right here? And those same two numbers, when\\nyou take their product, have to be equal to 9. And of course, this has to\\nbe in standard form. Or if it's not in standard form,\\nyou should put it in that form, so that you can\\nalways say, OK, whatever's on the first degree coefficient,\\nmy a and b have to add to that. Whatever's my constant term, my\\na times b, the product has to be that. Let's do several\\nmore examples. I think the more examples\\nwe do the more sense this'll make. Let's say we had x squared\\nplus 10x, plus-- well, I already did 10x, let's do a\\ndifferent number-- x squared plus 15x, plus 50. And we want to factor this. Well, same drill. We have an x squared term. We have a first degree term. This right here should be\\nthe sum of two numbers. And then this term, the constant\\nterm right here, should be the product\\nof two numbers. So we need to think of two\\nnumbers that, when I multiply them I get 50, and when\\nI add them, I get 15. And this is going to be a bit of\\nan art that you're going to develop, but the more practice\\nyou do, you're going to see that it'll start to\\ncome naturally. So what could a and b be? Let's think about the\\nfactors of 50. It could be 1 times 50. 2 times 25. Let's see, 4 doesn't\\ngo into 50. It could be 5 times 10. I think that's all of them. Let's try out these numbers,\\nand see if any of these add up to 15. So 1 plus 50 does not\\nadd up to 15. 2 plus 25 does not\\nadd up to 15. But 5 plus 10 does\\nadd up to 15. So this could be 5 plus 10, and\\nthis could be 5 times 10. So if we were to factor this,\\nthis would be equal to x plus 5, times x plus 10. And multiply it out. I encourage you to multiply this\\nout, and see that this is indeed x squared plus\\n15x, plus 10. In fact, let's do it. x\\ntimes x, x squared. x times 10, plus 10x. 5 times x, plus 5x. 5 times 10, plus 50. Notice, the 5 times\\n10 gave us the 50. The 5x plus the 10x is giving\\nus the 15x in between. So it's x squared plus\\n15x, plus 50. Let's up the stakes a little\\nbit, introduce some negative signs in here. Let's say I had x squared\\nminus 11x, plus 24. Now, it's the exact\\nsame principle. I need to think of two numbers,\\nthat when I add them, need to be equal\\nto negative 11. a plus b need to be equal\\nto negative 11. And a times b need to\\nbe equal to 24. Now, there's something for\\nyou to think about. When I multiply both of these\\nnumbers, I'm getting a positive number. I'm getting a 24. That means that both of these\\nneed to be positive, or both of these need to be negative. That's the only way I'm going to\\nget a positive number here. Now, if when I add them, I get\\na negative number, if these were positive, there's no way I\\ncan add two positive numbers and get a negative number, so\\nthe fact that their sum is negative, and the fact that\\ntheir product is positive, tells me that both a\\nand b are negative. a and b have to be negative. Remember, one can't be negative\\nand the other one can't be positive, because the\\nproduct would be negative. And they both can't be positive,\\nbecause when you add them it would get you\\na positive number. So let's just think about\\nwhat a and b can be. So two negative numbers. So let's think about\\nthe factors of 24. And we'll kind of have to think\\nof the negative factors. But let me see, it could be 1\\ntimes 24, 2 times 11, 3 times 8, or 4 times 6. Now, which of these when I\\nmultiply these-- well, obviously when I multiply\\n1 times 24, I get 24. When I get 2 times 11-- sorry,\\nthis is 2 times 12. I get 24. So we know that all these,\\nthe products are 24. But which two of these, which\\ntwo factors, when I add them, should I get 11? And then we could say,\\nlet's take the negative of both of those. So when you look at these,\\n3 and 8 jump out. 3 times 8 is equal to 24. 3 plus 8 is equal to 11. But that doesn't quite\\nwork out, right? Because we have a negative\\n11 here. But what if we did negative\\n3 and negative 8? Negative 3 times negative 8\\nis equal to positive 24. Negative 3 plus negative 8\\nis equal to negative 11. So negative 3 and\\nnegative 8 work. So if we factor this, x squared\\nminus 11x, plus 24 is going to be equal to x minus\\n3, times x minus 8. Let's do another\\none like that. Actually, let's mix it\\nup a little bit. Let's say I had x squared\\nplus 5x, minus 14. So here we have a different\\nsituation. The product of my two numbers is\\nnegative, right? a times b is equal to negative 14. My product is negative. That tells me that one of them\\nis positive, and one of them is negative. And when I add the two, a plus\\nb, it'd be equal to 5. So let's think about\\nthe factors of 14. And what combinations of them,\\nwhen I add them, if one is positive and one is negative,\\nor I'm really kind of taking the difference of the\\ntwo, do I get 5? So if I take 1 and 14-- I'm just\\ngoing to try out things-- 1 and 14, negative 1 plus\\n14 is negative 13. Negative 1 plus 14 is 13. So let me write all of the\\ncombinations that I could do. And eventually your brain\\nwill just zone in on it. So you've got negative 1\\nplus 14 is equal to 13. And 1 plus negative 14 is\\nequal to negative 13. So those don't work. That doesn't equal 5. Now what about 2 and 7? If I do negative 2-- let me do\\nthis in a different color-- if I do negative 2 plus 7,\\nthat is equal to 5. We're done! That worked! I mean, we could have tried 2\\nplus negative 7, but that'd be equal to negative 5, so that\\nwouldn't have worked. But negative 2 plus 7 works. And negative 2 times\\n7 is negative 14. So there we have it. We know it's x minus\\n2, times x plus 7. That's pretty neat. Negative 2 times 7\\nis negative 14. Negative 2 plus 7\\nis positive 5. Let's do several more of these,\\njust to really get well honed this skill. So let's say we have x squared\\nminus x, minus 56. So the product of the two\\nnumbers have to be minus 56, have to be negative 56. And their difference, because\\none is going to be positive, and one is going to be\\nnegative, right? Their difference has\\nto be negative 1. And the numbers that immediately\\njump out in my brain-- and I don't know if they\\njump out in your brain, we just learned this in\\nthe times tables-- 56 is 8 times 7. I mean, there's other numbers. It's also 28 times 2. It's all sorts of things. But 8 times 7 really jumped\\nout into my brain, because they're very close\\nto each other. And we need numbers that are\\nvery close to each other. And one of these has to be\\npositive, and one of these has to be negative. Now, the fact that when their\\nsum is negative, tells me that the larger of these two should\\nprobably be negative. So if we take negative\\n8 times 7, that's equal to negative 56. And then if we take negative\\n8 plus 7, that is equal to negative 1, which is exactly the\\ncoefficient right there. So when I factor this, this\\nis going to be x minus 8, times x plus 7. This is often one of the hardest\\nconcepts people learn in algebra, because it\\nis a bit of an art. You have to look at all of the\\nfactors here, play with the positive and negative signs,\\nsee which of those factors when one is positive, one is\\nnegative, add up to the coefficient on the x term. But as you do more and more\\npractice, you'll see that it'll become a bit\\nof second nature. Now let's step up the stakes\\na little bit more. Let's say we had negative x\\nsquared-- everything we've done so far had a positive\\ncoefficient, a positive 1 coefficient on the\\nx squared term. But let's say we had a\\nnegative x squared minus 5x, plus 24. How do we do this? Well, the easiest way I can\\nthink of doing it is factor out a negative 1, and then it\\nbecomes just like the problems we've been doing before. So this is the same thing as\\nnegative 1 times positive x squared, plus 5x, minus 24. Right? I just factored a\\nnegative 1 out. You can multiply negative 1\\ntimes all of these, and you'll see it becomes this. Or you could factor the negative\\n1 out and divide all of these by negative 1. And you get that right there. Now, same game as before. I need two numbers, that when\\nI take their product I get negative 24. So one will be positive,\\none will be negative. When I take their sum,\\nit's going to be 5. So let's think about\\n24 is 1 and 24. Let's see, if this is negative 1\\nand 24, it'd be positive 23, if it was the other way around,\\nit'd be negative 23. Doesn't work. What about 2 and 12? Well, if this is negative--\\nremember, one of these has to be negative. If the 2 is negative, their\\nsum would be 10. If the 12 is negative, their\\nsum would be negative 10. Still doesn't work. 3 and 8. If the 3 is negative,\\ntheir sum will be 5. So it works! So if we pick negative 3 and\\n8, negative 3 and 8 work. Because negative\\n3 plus 8 is 5. Negative 3 times 8\\nis negative 24. So this is going to be equal\\nto-- can't forget that negative 1 out front, and then\\nwe factor the inside. Negative 1 times x minus\\n3, times x plus 8. And if you really wanted to,\\nyou could multiply the negative 1 times this,\\nyou would get 3 minus x if you did. Or you don't have to. Let's do one more of these. The more practice, the\\nbetter, I think. All right, let's say I had\\nnegative x squared plus 18x, minus 72. So once again, I like to factor\\nout the negative 1. So this is equal to negative\\n1 times x squared, minus 18x, plus 72. Now we just have to think of\\ntwo numbers, that when I multiply them I get\\npositive 72. So they have to be\\nthe same sign. And that makes it easier in our\\nhead, at least in my head. When I multiply them,\\nI get positive 72. When I add them, I\\nget negative 18. So they're the same sign, and\\ntheir sum is a negative number, they both must\\nbe negative. And we could go through all\\nof the factors of 72. But the one that springs up,\\nmaybe you think of 8 times 9, but 8 times 9, or negative 8\\nminus 9, or negative 8 plus negative 9, doesn't work. That turns into 17. That was close. Let me show you that. Negative 9 plus negative 8, that\\nis equal to negative 17. Close, but no cigar. So what other ones are there? We have 6 and 12. That actually seems\\npretty good. If we have negative 6 plus\\nnegative 12, that is equal to negative 18. Notice, it's a bit of an art. You have to try the different\\nfactors here. So this will become negative\\n1-- don't want to forget that-- times x minus 6,\\ntimes x minus 12. \",\n",
       " '13.5.4': \"- [Instructor] Averil was trying to factor six x squared minus 18x plus 12. She found that the greatest common factor of these terms was six\\nand made an area model. What is the width of Averil's area model? So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out, and then we'll work through this together. All right, so there's a couple\\nof ways to think about it. She's trying to factor six x squared minus 18x plus 12, and she figured out that the\\ngreatest common factor was six. So one way you could think about it is this could be rewritten as\\nsix times something else. And to help her think about it, she thought about an area model, where if you had a rectangle, if you had a rectangle like this, and if the height is six and the width, let's just call that the width for now, so this is the width right over here. If you multiply six times the width, maybe I could write width right over here, if you multiply six times the width, you multiply the height times the width, you're going to get the area. So imagine that the area of this rectangle was our original expression, six x squared minus 18x plus 12. And that's exactly what's drawn here. Now, what's interesting\\nis is that they broke up the area into three sections. This pink section is the six x squared, this blue section is the negative 18x, and this peach section is the 12. And, of course, these\\naren't drawn to scale, 'cause we don't even know\\nhow wide each of these are 'cause we don't know what x is. So this is all a little bit abstract, but it's to show that we\\ncan break our bigger area into three smaller areas. And what's useful about\\nthis is we could think about the width of each of these sub-areas, and then we can add them together to figure out the total width. So what is the width of this\\npink section right over here? Well, six times what is six x squared? Well, six times x\\nsquared is six x squared, so the width here is x squared. Now, what about this blue area? A height of six times what width is equal to negative 18x? So let's see, if I take\\nsix times negative three, I get negative 18, then I have to multiply\\nit times an x as well to get negative 18x. So six times negative\\nthree x is negative 18x. And then, last but not least, six, our height of six, times what is going to be equal to 12? Well, six times two is equal to 12. So we figured out the widths\\nof each of these subregions, and now we know what the total width is. The total width is going\\nto be our x squared plus our negative three x, plus our two. So the width is going to be x squared, and I can just write that as, minus three x, plus two. So we have answered the question. And you could substitute\\nthat back in for this, and you could see, if\\nyou multiplied six times all of this, if you distributed the six, you would indeed get six x\\nsquared minus 18x plus 12. \",\n",
       " '13.5.5': \"- [Instructor] So let's\\nsee if we can try to factor the following expression completely. So factor this completely, pause the video and have a go at that. All right, now let's work\\nthrough this together. So the way that I like to think about it, I first try to see is\\nthere any common factor to all the terms, and I\\ntry to find the greatest of the common factor, possible common factors\\nto all of the terms. So let's see, they're\\nall divisible by two, so two would be a common factor, but let's see, they're\\nalso all divisible by four, four is divisible by four,\\neight is divisible by four, 12 is divisible by four, and that looks like the\\ngreatest common factor. They're not all divisible by x, so I can't throw an x in there. So what I wanna do is factor out a four. So I could re-write this as four times, now what would it be, four times what? Well if I factor a four\\nout of four x squared, I'm just going to be\\nleft with an x squared. If I factor a four out\\nof negative eight x, negative eight x divided\\nby four is negative two, so I'm going to have negative two x. And if I factor a four out of negative 12, negative 12 divided by\\nfour is negative three. Now am I done factoring? Well it looks like I\\ncould factor this thing a little bit more. Can I think of two numbers\\nthat add up to negative two, and when I multiply it\\nI get negative three, since when I multiply\\nI get a negative value, one of the 'em is going to be positive and one of 'em is going to be negative. I can think about it this way. A plus B is equal to negative two, A times B needs to be\\nequal to negative three. So let's see, A could be\\nequal to negative three and B could be equal to one because negative three\\nplus one is negative two, and negative three times\\none is negative three. So I could re-write all of this as four times x plus negative three, or I could just write\\nthat as x minus three, times x plus one, x plus one. And now I have actually\\nfactored this completely. Let's do another example. So let's say that we had the expression negative three x squared\\nplus 21 x minus 30. Pause the video and see if you\\ncan factor this completely. All right now let's do this together. So what would be the\\ngreatest common factor? So let's see, they're\\nall divisible by three, so you could factor out a three. Let's see what happens if\\nyou factor out a three. This is the same thing as three times, well negative three x squared divided by three is negative x squared, 21 x divided by three is\\nseven x, so plus seven x, and then negative 30 divided\\nby three is negative 10. You could do it this way, but having this negative\\nout on the x squared term still makes it a little bit confusing on how you would factor this further. You can do it, but it still takes a little bit more of a mental load. So instead of just factoring out a three, let's factor out a negative three. So we could write it this way. If we factor out a negative\\nthree, what does that become? Well then if you factor\\nout a negative three out of this term, you're just\\nleft with an x squared. If you factor out a negative\\nthree from this term, 21 divided by negative\\nthree is negative seven x. And if you factor out a negative\\nthree out of negative 30, you're left with a\\npositive 10, positive 10. And now let's see if we\\ncan factor this thing a little bit more. Can I think of two numbers\\nwhere if I were to add them I get to negative seven, and if I were to multiply\\nthem, I get to 10? And let's see, they'd\\nhave to have the same sign 'cause their product is positive. So let's see A could be\\nequal to negative five, and then B is equal to negative two. So I can re-write this\\nwhole thing as equal to negative three times\\nx plus negative five, which is the same thing as x minus five, times x plus negative two, which is the same thing as x minus two. And now we have factored completely. \",\n",
       " '13.6.1': \"In this video, I want to focus\\non a few more techniques for factoring polynomials. And in particular, I want to\\nfocus on quadratics that don't have a 1 as the leading\\ncoefficient. For example, if I wanted\\nto factor 4x squared plus 25x minus 21. Everything we've factored so\\nfar, or all of the quadratics we've factored so far, had\\neither a 1 or negative 1 where this 4 is sitting. All of a sudden now, we\\nhave this 4 here. So what I'm going to teach you\\nis a technique called, factoring by grouping. And it's a little bit more\\ninvolved than what we've learned before, but\\nit's a neat trick. To some degree, it'll become\\nobsolete once you learn the quadratic formula, because,\\nfrankly, the quadratic formula is a lot easier. But this is how it goes. I'll show you the technique. And then at the end of this\\nvideo, I'll actually show you why it works. So what we need to do here,\\nis we need to think of two numbers, a and b, where a\\ntimes b is equal 4 times negative 21. So a times b is going to be\\nequal to 4 times negative 21, which is equal to negative 84. And those same two numbers,\\na plus b, need to be equal to 25. Let me be very clear. This is the 25, so they need\\nto be equal to 25. This is where the 4 is. So we go, 4 times negative 21. That's a negative 21. So what two numbers are there\\nthat would do this? Well, we have to look at the\\nfactors of negative 84. And once again, one\\nof these are going to have to be positive. The other ones are going to have\\nto be negative, because their product is negative. So let's think about\\nthe different factors that might work. 4 and negative 21 look\\ntantalizing, but when you add them, you get negative 17. Or, if you had negative 4 and\\n21, you'd get positive 17. Doesn't work. Let's try some other\\ncombinations. 1 and 84, too far apart when\\nyou take their difference. Because that's essentially what\\nyou're going to do, if one is negative and\\none is positive. Too far apart. Let's see you could do 3--\\nI'm jumping the gun. 2 and 42. Once again, too far apart. Negative 2 plus 42 is 40. 2 plus negative 42 is negative\\n40-- too far apart. 3 and-- Let's see, 3 goes into\\n84-- 3 goes into 8 2 times. 2 times 3 is 6. 8 minus 6 is 2. Bring down the 4. Goes exactly 8 times. So 3 and 28. This seems interesting. And remember, one of these\\nhas to be negative. So if we have negative 3 plus\\n28, that is equal to 25. Now, we've found our\\ntwo numbers. But it's not going to be quite\\nas simple of an operation as what we did when this was\\na 1 or negative 1. What we're going to do now is\\nsplit up this term right here. We're going to split it up into\\npositive 28x minus 3x. We're just going to\\nsplit that term. That term is that term\\nright there. And of course, you have your\\nminus 21 there, and you have your 4x squared over here. Now, you might say, how did you\\npick the 28 to go here, and the negative\\n3 to go there? And it actually does matter. The way I thought about it is\\n3 or negative 3, and 21 or negative 21 , they have\\nsome common factors. In particular, they have\\nthe factor 3 in common. And 28 and 4 have some\\ncommon factors. So I grouped the 28 on\\nthe side of the 4. And you're going to see what\\nI mean in a second. If we, literally, group these\\nso that term becomes 4x squared plus 28x. And then, this side, over\\nhere in pink, it's plus negative 3x minus 21. Once again, I picked these. I grouped the negative 3 with\\nthe 21, or the negative 21, because they're both\\ndivisible by 3. And I grouped the 28 with the\\n4, because they're both divisible by 4. And now, in each of these\\ngroups, we factor as much out as we can. So both of these terms\\nare divisible by 4x. So this orange term is equal\\nto 4x times x-- 4x squared divided by 4x is just x-- plus\\n28x divided by 4x is just 7. Now, this second term. Remember, you factor\\nout everything that you can factor out. Well, both of these terms are\\ndivisible by 3 or negative 3. So let's factor out\\na negative 3. And this becomes x plus 7. And now, something might\\npop out at you. We have x plus 7 times\\n4x plus, x plus 7 times negative 3. So we can factor out\\nan x plus 7. This might not be completely\\nobvious. You're probably not\\nused to factoring out an entire binomial. But you could view this\\ncould be like a. Or if you have 4xa minus 3a,\\nyou would be able to factor out an a. And I can just leave this\\nas a minus sign. Let me delete this\\nplus right here. Because it's just\\nminus 3, right? Plus negative 3, same\\nthing as minus 3. So what can we do here? We have an x plus 7, times 4x. We have an x plus 7,\\ntimes negative 3. Let's factor out the x plus 7. We get x plus 7, times\\n4x minus 3. Minus that 3 right there. And we've factored\\nour binomial. Sorry, we've factored our\\nquadratic by grouping. And we factored it into\\ntwo binomials. Let's do another example of\\nthat, because it's a little bit involved. But once you get the hang\\nof it's kind of fun. So let's say we want to factor\\n6x squared plus 7x plus 1. Same drill. We want to find a times b that\\nis equal to 1 times 6, which is equal to 6. And we want to find an a plus\\nb needs to be equal to 7. This is a little bit more\\nstraightforward. What are the-- well, the obvious\\none is 1 and 6, right? 1 times 6 is 6. 1 plus 6 is 7. So we have a is equal to 1. Or let me not even\\nassign them. The numbers here are 1 and 6. Now, we want to split this\\ninto a 1x and a 6x. But we want to group it so it's\\non the side of something that it shares a factor with. So we're going to have a 6x\\nsquar ed here, plus-- and so I'm going to put the\\n6x first because 6 and 6 share a factor. And then, we're going to\\nhave plus 1x, right? 6x plus 1x equals 7x . That was the whole point. They had to add up to 7 . And then we have the\\nfinal plus 1 there. Now, in each of these groups,\\nwe can factor out as much as we like. So in this first group,\\nlet's factor out a 6x. So this first group becomes 6x\\ntimes-- 6x squar ed divided by 6x is just an x. 6x divided by 6x is just a 1. And then, the second\\ngroup-- we're going to have a plus here. But this second group, we just\\nliterally have a x plus 1. Or we could even write a\\n1 times an x plus 1. You could imagine I just\\nfactored out of 1 so to speak. Now, I have 6x times x plus\\n1, plus 1 times x plus 1. Well, I can factor\\nout the x plus 1. If I factor out an x plus 1,\\nthat's equal to x plus 1 times 6x plus that 1. I'm just doing the distributive property in reverse. So hopefully you didn't\\nfind that too bad. And now, I'm going to actually\\nexplain why this little magical system actually works. Let me take an example. I'll do it in very\\ngeneral terms. Let's say I had ax plus b,\\ntimes cx-- actually, I'm afraid to use the a's and b's. I think that'll confuse\\nyou, because I use a's and b's here. They won't be the same thing. So let me use completely\\ndifferent letters. Let's say I have fx plus g,\\ntimes hx plus, I'll use j instead of i. You'll learn in the future\\nwhy don't like using i as a variable. So what is this going\\nto be equal to? Well, it's going to be fx\\ntimes hx which is fhx. And then, fx times j. So plus fjx. And then, we're going\\nto have g times hx. So plus ghx. And then g times j. Plus gj. Or, if we add these two middle\\nterms, you have fh times x, plus-- add these two terms--\\nfj plus gh x. Plus gj. Now, what did I do here? Well, remember, in all of these\\nproblems where you have a non-1 or non-negative 1\\ncoefficient here, we look for two numbers that add up to this,\\nwhose product is equal to the product of\\nthat times that. Well, here we have two numbers\\nthat add up-- let's say that a is equal to fj. That is a. And b is equal to gh. So a plus b is going to be\\nequal to that middle coefficient. And then what is a times b? a\\ntimes b is going to be equal to fj times gh. We could just reorder these\\nterms. We're just multiplying a bunch of terms. So that could\\nbe rewritten as f times h times g times j. These are all the same things. Well, what is fh times gj? This is equal to fh times gj. Well, this is equal to the first\\ncoefficient times the constant term. So a plus b will be equal to\\nthe middle coefficient. And a times b will equal the\\nfirst coefficient times the constant term. So that's why this whole\\nfactoring by grouping even works, or how we're able\\nto figure out what a and b even are. Now, I'm going to close up\\nwith something slightly different, but just to make\\nsure that you have a well-rounded education\\nin factoring things. What I want to do is to teach\\nyou to factor things a little bit more completely. And this is a little\\nbit of a add-on. I was going to make a\\nwhole video on this. But I think, on some level,\\nit might be a little obvious for you. So let's say we had-- let\\nme get a good one here. Let's say we had negative\\nx to the third, plus 17x squared, minus 70x. Immediately, you say, gee, this\\nisn't even a quadratic. I don't know how to solve\\nsomething like this. It has an x to third power. And the first thing you should\\nrealize is that every term here is divisible by x. So let's factor out an x. Or even better, let's factor\\nout a negative x. So if you factor out a negative\\nx, this is equal to negative x times-- negative\\nx to the third divided by negative x is x squared. 17x squared divided by negative\\nx is negative 17x. Negative 70x divided by negative\\nx is positive 70. The x's cancel out. And now, you have something\\nthat might look a little bit familiar. We have just a standard\\nquadratic where the leading coefficient is a 1. We just have to find two numbers\\nwhose product is 70, and that add up to\\nnegative 17. And the numbers that immediately\\njumped into my head are negative 10\\nand negative 7. You take their product,\\nyou get 70. You add them up, you\\nget negative 17. So this part right here is\\ngoing to be x minus 10, times x minus 7. And of course, you have that\\nleading negative x. The general idea here is just\\nsee if there's anything you can factor out. And that'll get it into a form\\nthat you might recognize. Hopefully, you found\\nthis helpful. I want to reiterate what I\\nshowed you at the beginning of this video. I think it's a really cool\\ntrick, so to speak, to be able to factor things that have\\na non-1 or non-negative 1 leading coefficient. But to some degree, you're going\\nto find out easier ways to do this, especially\\nwith the quadratic formula, in not too long. \",\n",
       " '13.6.2': \"We're asked to factor 4y squared\\nplus 4y, minus 15. And whenever you have an\\nexpression like this, where you have a non-one coefficient\\non the y squared, or on the second degree term-- it could\\nhave been an x squared-- the best way to do this\\nis by grouping. And to factor by grouping we\\nneed to look for two numbers whose product is equal to\\n4 times negative 15. So we're looking for two numbers\\nwhose product-- let's call those a and b-- is going\\nto be equal to 4 times negative 15, or negative 60. And the sum of those two\\nnumbers, a plus b, needs to be equal to this 4 right there. So let's think about all the\\nfactors of negative 60, or 60. And we're looking for ones that\\nare essentially 4 apart, because the numbers are going\\nto be of different signs, because their product is\\nnegative, so when you take two numbers of different signs and\\nyou sum them, you kind of view it as the difference of\\ntheir absolute values. If that confuses you, don't\\nworry about it. But this tells you that the\\nnumbers, since they're going to be of different size, their\\nabsolute values are going to be roughly 4 apart. So we could try out things like\\n5 and 12, 5 and negative 12, because one has\\nto be negative. If you add these two you get\\nnegative 7, if you did negative 5 and 12 you'd\\nget positive 7. They're just still\\ntoo far apart. What if we tried 6\\nand negative 10? Then you get a negative 4,\\nif you added these two. But we want a positive 4, so\\nlet's do negative 6 and 10. Negative 6 plus 10\\nis positive 4. So those will be our two\\nnumbers, negative 6 and positive 10. Now, what we want to do\\nis we want to break up this middle term here. The whole point of figuring out\\nthe negative 6 and the 10 is to break up the 4y into\\na negative 6y and a 10y. So let's do that. So this 4y can be rewritten as\\nnegative 6y plus 10y, right? Because if you add\\nthose you get 4y. And then the other sides of it,\\nyou have your 4y squared, your 4y squared and then\\nyou have your minus 15. All I did is expand this into\\nthese two numbers as being the coefficients on the y. If you add these, you\\nget the 4y again. Now, this is where the\\ngrouping comes in. You group the term. Let me do it in a\\ndifferent color. So if I take these two guys,\\nwhat can I factor out of those two guys? Well, there's a common factor,\\nit looks like there's a common factor of 2y. So if we factor out 2y, we get\\n2y times 4y squared, divided by 2y is 2y. And then negative 6y divided\\nby 2y is negative 3. So this group gets factored\\ninto 2y times 2y, minus 3. Now, let's look at this other\\ngroup right here. This was the whole point about\\nbreaking it up like this. And in other videos I've\\nexplained why this works. Now here, the greatest\\ncommon factor is a 5. So we can factor out a 5, so\\nthis is equal to plus 5 times 10y, divided by 5 is 2y. Negative 15 divided\\nby five is 3. And so we have 2y times\\n2y minus 3, plus 5 times 2y minus 3. So now you have two terms,\\nand 2y minus 3 is a common factor to both. So let's factor out a 2y minus\\n3, so this is equal to 2y minus 3, times 2y, times\\nthat 2y, plus that 5. There's no magic happening\\nhere, all I did is undistribute the 2y minus 3. I factored it out of\\nboth of these guys. I took it out of the\\nparentheses. If I distribute it in, you'd get\\nback to this expression. But we're done, we\\nfactored it. We factored it into two\\nbinomial expressions. 4y squared plus 4y, minus\\n15 is 2y minus 3, times 2y plus 5. \",\n",
       " '13.6.3': \"We need to factor negative 12f\\nsquared minus 38f, plus 22. So a good place to start is just\\nto see if, is there any common factor for all three\\nof these terms? When we look at them,\\nthey're all even. And we don't like a negative\\nnumber out here. So let's divide everything, or\\nlet's factor out a negative 2. So this expression right here is\\nthe same thing as negative 2 times-- what's negative 12f\\nsquared divided by negative 2? It's positive 6f squared. Negative 38 divided by negative\\n2 is positive 19, so it'll be positive 19f. And then 22 divided by negative\\n22-- oh, sorry, 22 divided by negative\\n2 is negative 11. So we've simplified it a bit. We have the 6f squared\\nplus 19f, minus 11. We'll just focus on that\\npart right now. And the best way to factor this\\nthing, since we don't have a 1 here as the coefficient\\non the f squared, is to factor it by grouping. So we need to look for two\\nnumbers whose product is 6 times negative 11. So two numbers, so a times b,\\nneeds to be equal to 6 times negative 11, or negative 66. And a plus b needs to\\nbe equal to 19. So let's try a few\\nnumbers here. So let's see, 22, I'm just\\nthinking of numbers that are roughly 19 apart, because\\nthey're going to be of different signs. So 22 and 3, I think\\nwill work. Right. If we take 22 times negative 3,\\nthat is negative 66, and 22 plus negative 3 is\\nequal to 19. And the way I kind of got pretty\\nclose to this number is, well, you know, they're\\ngoing to be of different signs, so the positive versions\\nof them have to be about 19 apart, and\\nthat worked out. 22 and negative 3. So now we can rewrite this 19f\\nright here as the sum of negative 3f and 22f. That's the same thing as 19f. I just kind of broke it apart. And, of course, we have the\\n6f squared and we have the minus 11 here. Now, you're probably saying, hey\\nSal, why did you put the 22 here and the negative\\n3 there? Why didn't you do it the\\nother way around? Why didn't you put the 22 and\\nthen the negative 3 there? And my main motivation for doing\\nit, I like to put the negative 3 on the same side with\\nthe 6 because they have the common factor of the 3. I like to put the 22 with the\\nnegative 11, they have the same common factor of 11. So that's why I decided\\nto do it that way. So now let's do the grouping. And, of course, you can't forget\\nthis negative 2 that we have sitting out here\\nthe whole time. So let me put that negative 2\\nout there, but that'll just kind of hang out for awhile. But let's do some grouping. So let's group these\\nfirst two. And then we're going to group\\nthis-- let me get a nice color here-- and then we're going\\nto group this second two. Well, that's almost an\\nidentical color. Let me do it in this\\npurple color. And then we can group that\\nsecond two right there. So these first two, we could\\nfactor out a negative 3f, so it's negative 3f times-- 6f\\nsquared divided by negative 3f is negative 2f. And then negative 3f divided\\nby negative 3f is just positive f. Actually, a better way to start,\\ninstead of factoring out a negative 3f, let's just\\nfactor out 3f, so we don't have a negative out here. We could do it either way. But if we just factor\\nout a 3f, 6f squared divided by 3f is 2f. And then negative 3f divided\\nby 3f is negative 1. So that's what that\\nfactors into. And then that second part, in\\nthat dark purple color, can factor out an 11. And if we factor that out, 22f\\ndivided by 11 is 2f, and negative 11 divided by\\n11 is negative 1. And, of course, once again,\\nyou have that negative 2 hanging out there. Now, inside the parentheses,\\nwe have two terms, both of which have 2f minus\\n1 as a factor. So we can factor that out. This whole thing is just an\\nexercise in doing the reverse distributive property,\\nif you will. So let's factor that out, so\\nyou have 2f minus 1, times this 3f, and then times\\nthat plus 11. Let me do that in the\\nsame shade of purple right over there. And you know, you can distribute\\nit if you like. 2f minus 1 times 3f will give\\nyou this term, 2f f minus 1 times 11 will give\\nyou that term. And we can't forget that we\\nstill have that negative 2 hanging out outside. I want to change the\\ncolors on it. And we're done factoring it. Negative 12f squared minus 38f,\\nplus 22 is negative 2 times 2f minus 1, times\\n3f plus 11. \",\n",
       " '13.7.1': \"- [Instructor] We're now\\ngoing to explore factoring a type of expression called\\na difference of squares and the reason why it's\\ncalled a difference of squares is 'cause it's expressions\\nlike x squared minus nine. This is a difference. We're subtracting between two quantities that are each squares. This is literally x squared. Let me do that in a different color. This is x squared minus three squared. It's the difference between two quantities that have been squared and it turns out that this is pretty\\nstraightforward to factor. And to see how it can be factored, let me pause there for a second and get a little bit of review\\nof multiplying binomials. So put this on the back\\nburner a little bit. Before I give you the answer\\nof how you factor this, let's do a little bit of an exercise. Let's multiply x plus a times x minus a where a is some number. Now, we can use that, do that using either the FOIL method but I like just thinking of this as a distributive property twice. We could take x plus a and distribute it onto\\nthe x and onto the a. So when we multiply it by x, we would get x times x is x squared, a times x is plus ax and then when we multiply\\nit by the negative a, well, it'll become negative a times x minus a squared. So these middle two terms cancel out and you are left with x\\nsquared minus a squared. You're left with a difference of squares. x squared minus a squared. So we have an interesting\\nresult right over here that x squared minus\\na squared is equal to, is equal to x plus a, x plus a times x minus a. And so we can use, and this is for any a. So we could use this\\npattern now to factor this. Here, what is our a? Our a is three. This is x squared minus three squared or we could say minus our a\\nsquared if we say three is a and so to factor it, this\\nis just going to be equal to x plus our a which is three times x minus our a which is three. So x plus three times x minus three. Now, let's do some examples\\nto really reinforce this idea of factoring differences of squares. So let's say we want to factor, let me say y squared minus 25 and it has to be a difference of squares. It doesn't work with a sum of squares. Well, in this case, this is going to be y\\nand you have to confirm, okay, yeah, 25 is five squared and y squared is well, y squared. So this gonna be y plus\\nsomething times y minus something and what is that something? Well, this right here is five\\nsquared so it's y plus five times y minus five and the variable doesn't\\nhave to come first. We could write 121 minus, I'll introduce a new\\nvariable, minus b squared. Well, this is a difference of squares because 121 is 11 squared. So this is going to be 11 plus something times 11 minus something and in this case, that something is going to be\\nthe thing that was squared. So 11 plus b times 11 minus b. So in general, if you see\\na difference of squares, one square being subtracted\\nfrom another square and it could be a numeric perfect square or it could be a variable that\\nhas been squared that can be, that you could take the square root of. Well, then you could say, alright, well, that's just gonna be the first thing that squared plus the second\\nthing that has been squared times the first thing that was squared minus the second thing that was squared. Now, some common mistakes\\nthat I've seen people do including my son when\\nthey first learned this is they say, okay, it's easy to recognize the difference of squares but then they say, oh,\\nis this y squared plus 25 times y squared minus 25? No, the important thing to realize is is that what is getting squared? Over here, y is the thing getting squared and over here it is five\\nthat is getting squared. Those are the things\\nthat are getting squared in this difference of squares and so it's gonna be y plus\\nfive times y minus five. I encourage you to just try this out. We have a whole practice\\nsection on Khan Academy where you can do many many more\\nof these to become familiar. \",\n",
       " '13.7.2': \"Let's see if we can\\nfactor the expression 45x squared minus 125. So whenever I see\\nsomething like this-- I have a second-degree\\nterm here, I have a subtraction\\nsign-- my temptation is to look at this as a\\ndifference of squares. We've already seen\\nthis multiple times. We've already seen that if\\nwe have something of the form a squared minus b squared, that\\nthis can be factored as a plus b times a minus b. So let's look over here. Well, over here,\\nit's not obvious that this right over\\nhere is a perfect square. Neither is it obvious\\nthat this right over here is a perfect square. So it's not clear\\nto me that this is a difference of squares. But what is interesting\\nis that both 45 and 125 have some factors in common. And the one that\\njumps out at me is 5. So let's see if we can factor\\nout a 5, and by doing that, whether we can get something\\nthat's a little bit closer to this pattern right over here. So if we factor out a 5,\\nthis becomes 5 times-- well, 45x squared divided by 5\\nis going to be 9x squared. And then 125 divided by 5 is 25. Now, this is interesting. 9x squared-- that's\\na perfect square. If we call this a\\nsquared, then that tells us that a\\nwould be equal to 3x. 3x-- the whole thing\\nsquared is 9x squared. Similarly-- I can never say\\nsimilarly correctly-- 25 is clearly just 5 squared. So in this case, if we're\\nlooking at this template, b would be equal to 5. So now this is a\\ndifference of squares, and we can factor it completely. So we can't forget our 5 out\\nfront that we factored out. So it's going to be\\n5 times a plus b. So let me write this. So it's going to be 5 times\\na plus b times a minus b. So let me write the b's\\ndown, plus b and minus b. And we're done. 5 times 3x plus 5\\ntimes 3x minus 5 is 45x squared minus\\n125 factored out. \",\n",
       " '13.7.3': \"- [Voiceover] Moussa and Fatu\\nwere each asked to factor the quadratic expression 16 x-squared minus 64. Their responses are shown below. So Moussa factored it this way. Fatu factored it this way. Which student wrote an\\nexpression that is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64? So I encourage you to pause\\nthe video and figure that out. Which student wrote an\\nexpression that is equivalent to our original one, 16 x-squared minus 64? Well let's work through it\\ntogether, so let's see if first we can factor this out\\nsomehow to get what Moussa got and it looks like Moussa\\nfirst factored out a 16 and then he was left with\\na difference of squares. So let's see if we can do that. So, we can write our original expression. 16 x-squared minus 64,\\nwe can write that as 16 times x-squared minus 16 times four. And when you write it like\\nthat, it's very clear that you can factor out a 16. So this is going to be equal to 16 times what you have left over is x-squared minus four and then x-squared minus four, that's a difference of\\nsquares right over there. So, that part we can factor as, so we have our original 16 and then... this part right over here, we can write as x plus two times x minus two. x plus two times x minus two. If what I just did in this\\nlast step, going from x-squared minus four to x plus two times x minus two doesn't make any sense, I\\nencourage you to watch some of the introductory videos on factoring and difference of squares. But the basic idea, I have a form here of a-squared minus b-squared, so\\nit's going to have the form of a plus b times a minus b and in this case it's\\nx-squared minus two squared. So it's going to be x plus\\ntwo times x minus two. So that's exactly what Moussa got. So this one, so Moussa, did get an expression\\nthat is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64. Now let's think about Fatu. So Fatu didn't factor\\nout a 16 from the get-go. It looks like he just\\nimmediately recognized that our original expression is\\nitself a difference of squares even if we don't factor out a 16, and so let's re-write it. So our original expression, we could write as, so instead of writing,\\nwell I'm just going to write it like this, this\\nis our original expression. 16 x-squared minus 64. That's the same thing as, 16\\nx-squared is the same thing as four x, the whole thing squared and then minus eight squared. So when you write it like\\nthis, it's clear that this is a difference of squares,\\nso this is going to be four x plus eight times\\nfour x minus eight. Four x plus eight times\\nfour x minus eight. Once again, if this last\\nstep that I did doesn't make a lot of sense I encourage\\nyou to watch the video on factoring difference\\nof squares where we go a lot more into the intuition of it. But when you see it this\\nway you realize that Fatu also got an expression\\nthat is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64, so they both did. \",\n",
       " '13.7.4': \"- [Voiceover] We're told that\\nthe quadratic expressions m squared minus 4m minus 45, and 6m squared minus 150, share a common binomial factor. What binomial factor do they share? And like always pause the video and see if you can work through this. All right, now let's work\\nthrough this together and the way I am going to do this is I'm just going to try and\\nfactor both of them into the product of binomials and\\nmaybe some other things and see if we have any\\ncommon binomial factors. So first let's focus on m squared minus 4m minus 45. So let me write it over here, m squared minus 4m minus 45. So when you're factoring a\\nquadratic expression like this, where the coefficient\\non the, in this case, m squared term, on the\\nsecond degree term is one, we could factor it as being equal to m plus a, times m plus b, where a plus b is going to be equal to this coefficient right over here, and a times b is going to be equal to this coefficient right over here. So let's be clear, so, a, let me see another color, so a plus b needs to\\nbe equal to negative 4, a plus b needs to be equal to negative 4, and then a times b needs\\nto be equal to negative 45. A times b is equal to negative 45. Now I like to focus on the\\na times b and think about, well, what could a and b\\nbe to get to negative 45? Well if I'm taking the\\nproduct of two things and if the product is negative that means that they are going to have different signs and if when we add them we get a\\nnegative number that means that the negative one has a larger magnitude. So let's think about this a little bit. So a times b is equal to negative 45. So this could be, let's\\ntry some values out. So, 1 and 45, those are too far apart. Let's see. 3 and 15, those still\\nseem pretty far apart. Let's see, it looks like\\n5 and 9 seem interesting. So if we say, if we say 5 times, if we were to say, 5 times negative 9, that indeed is equal to negative 45, and 5 plus negative 9 is indeed equal to negative 4. So a could be equal to 5 and b could be equal to negative 9. And so if we were to factor\\nthis, this is going to be m plus 5, times m, I could say m plus negative 9, but I'll just write m minus 9. So just like that I've\\nbeen able to factor this first quadratic expression right over there as a product of two binomials. So now let's try to factor the\\nother quadratic expression. Let's try to factor 6m squared minus 150. And let's see, the first\\nthing I might want to do is, both 6m squared and 150, they're both divisible by 6. So let me write it this\\nway, I could write it as, 6m squared minus 6 times, let's see, 6 goes into 150, 25 times. So all I did is I rewrote this and really I just wrote 150 as 6 times 25. And now you can clearly see\\nthat we can factor out a 6. You can view this as undistributing the 6. So this is the same thing as 6 times m squared minus 25, which we recognize this is\\na difference of squares. So it's all going to be 6 times, m plus 5, times m minus 5. And so we've factored this out\\nas a product of binomials and a constant factor here, 6, and so, what is their shared, common or what is their common\\nbinomial factor that they share? Well you see when we factored\\nit out, they both have an m plus 5. So m plus 5 is the binomial factor that they share. \",\n",
       " '13.8.1': '- [Narrator] We\\'re going to\\nlearn to recognize and factor perfect square polynomials in this video. So for example, say I have the polynomial x squared plus six x plus nine. And then someone asks you,\\n\"Hey, can you factor this \"into two binomials?\" Well, using techniques we\\nlearned in other videos, say, \"Okay, I need to find two numbers \"whose product is nine\\nand whose sum is six.\" And so I encourage you to\\npause this video and say, \"Well, what two numbers can add up to six, \"and if I take their product I get nine?\" Well, nine only has so many factors, really one, three, and nine. And one plus nine does not equal six. And so, and negative\\none plus negative nine does not equal six. But three times three equals nine, and three plus three does equal six. Three times three, three plus three. And so we can factor this as x plus three times x plus three, which is of course the same thing as x plus three squared. And so what was it about this expression that made us recognize, or maybe now we will start to recognize it as being a perfect square? Well, I have of course some\\nvariable that is being squared, which we need. I have some perfect square as a constant, and that whatever is being squared there, I have two times that as the coefficient on this first degree term here. Let\\'s see if that is generally true. And I\\'ll switch up the variables\\njust to show that we can. So let\\'s say that I have a\\nsquared plus 14 a plus 49. So a few interesting\\nthings are happening here. All right, I have my variable squared. I have a perfect square constant term, that is seven squared right over here. And my coefficient on my\\nfirst degree term here that is two times the\\nthing that\\'s being squared. That is two times seven, or you can say it\\'s seven plus seven. So you can immediately say, \"Okay, \"if I want to factor this, \"this is going to be\\na plus seven squared.\" And you can of course verify that by multiplying out, by figuring out what a\\nplus seven squared is. Sometimes when you\\'re first learning this, you\\'re like, \"Hey, isn\\'t\\nthat just a squared \"plus seven squared?\" No! Remember, this is the same thing as a plus seven times a plus seven. And you can calculate this by using the foil, F-O-I-L technique. I don\\'t like that so much because you\\'re not thinking mathematically about what\\'s happening. Really you just have to do\\ndistributive property twice here. First you can multiply\\na plus seven times a. So a plus seven times a. And then multiply a\\nplus seven times seven. So plus a plus seven times seven, and so this is going to\\nbe a squared plus seven a, plus, now we distribute the seven. Plus seven a plus 49. So now you see where that 14 a came from. It\\'s from the seven a plus the seven a. You see where the a squared came from. And you see where the 49 came from. And you can speak of this\\nin more general terms. If I wanted to just take the expression a plus b and square it, that\\'s just a plus b times a plus b, and we do exactly what we did just here, but here I\\'m just doing\\nin very general terms with a or b and you can think of a as either a constant number or even a variable. And so this is going to\\nbe, if we distribute this, it\\'s going to be a plus b times that a plus a plus b times that b. And so this is going to be a squared, now I\\'m just doing the\\ndistributive property again. A squared plus ab plus ab plus b squared. So it\\'s a squared plus\\ntwo ab plus b squared. So this is going to be the general form. So if a is the variable, which\\nwas x, or a in this case, then it\\'s just going\\nto be whatever squared and the constant term is\\ngoing to be two times that times the variable. And I want to show that\\nthere\\'s some variation that you can entertain here. So if you were to see 25\\nplus 10x plus x squared, and someone wanted you, said \"Hey, why don\\'t you factor that?\" we could say, \"Look, this\\nright here is a perfect square. \"It\\'s five squared. \"I have the variable\\nsquared right over here, \"and then this coefficient\\non our first degree term \"is two times five.\" And so you might immediately\\nrecognize this as five plus x squared. Now of course you could\\njust rewrite this polynomial as x squared plus 10 x plus 25 in which case you might say,\\n\"Okay, variable squared, \"some number squared, five squared, \"two times that number\\nis the coefficient here. \"So that\\'s going to be\\nx plus five squared.\" And that\\'s good because these two things are absolutely equivalent.

       " '13.8.2': \"Factor 25x squared\\nminus 30x plus 9. And we have a leading\\ncoefficient that's not a 1, and it doesn't look like\\nthere are any common factors. Both 25 and 30 are divisible by\\n5, but 9 isn't divisible by 5. We could factor\\nthis by grouping. But if we look a little\\nbit more carefully here, see something interesting. 25 is a perfect square, and 25x\\nsquared is a perfect square. It's the square of 5x. And then nine is also\\na perfect square. It's the square of\\n3, or actually, it could be the square\\nof negative 3. This could also be the\\nsquare of negative 5x. Maybe, just maybe this\\ncould be a perfect square. Let's just think\\nabout what happens when we take the perfect square\\nof a binomial, especially when the coefficient on\\nthe x term is not a 1. If we have ax plus b\\nsquared, what will this look like when we expand\\nthis into a trinomial? Well, this is the same\\nthing as ax plus b times ax plus b, which is the same\\nthing as ax times ax. Ax times ax is a squared x\\nsquared plus ax times b, which is abx plus b times\\nax, which is another. You You could call\\nit bax or abx, plus b times b, so plus b squared. This is equal to a squared\\nx squared plus-- these two are the same term--\\n2abx plus c squared. This is what happens when\\nyou square a binomial. Now, this pattern seems\\nto work out pretty good. Let me rewrite our\\nproblem right below it. We have 25x squared\\nminus 30x plus 9. If this is a\\nperfect square, then that means that the a squared\\npart right over here is 25. And then that means\\nthat the b squared part-- let me do this in\\na different color-- is 9. That tells us that a\\ncould be plus or minus 5 and that b could\\nbe plus or minus 3. Now let's see if this gels\\nwith this middle term. For this middle\\nterm to work out-- I'm trying to look for good\\ncolors-- 2ab, this part right over here, needs to\\nbe equal to negative 30. Or another way-- let me write\\nit over here-- 2ab needs to be equal to negative 30. Or if we divide\\nboth sides by 2, ab needs to be equal\\nto negative 15. That tells us that the\\nproduct is negative. One has to be positive,\\nand one has to be negative. Now, lucky for us the\\nproduct of 5 and 3 is 15. If we make one of them positive\\nand one of them negative, we'll get up to negative 15. It looks like things\\nare going to work out. We could select a is\\nequal to positive 5, and b is equal to negative 3. Those would work out to ab\\nbeing equal to negative 15. Or we could make a is\\nequal to negative 5, and b is equal to positive 3. Either of these will work. If we factor this\\nout, this could be either a is negative--\\nlet's do this first one. It could either be a\\nis 5, b is negative 3. This could either be\\n5x minus 3 squared. a is 5, b is negative 3. It could be that. Or you could have-- we could\\nswitch the signs on the two terms. Or a could be negative 5,\\nand b could be positive 3. Or it could be negative\\n5x plus 3 squared. Either of these\\nare possible ways to factor this term out here. And you say wait, how\\ndoes this work out? How can both of these\\nmultiply to the same thing? Well, this term, remember,\\nthis negative 5x plus 3, we could factor\\nout a negative 1. So this right here is the same\\nthing as negative 1 times 5x minus 3, the whole\\nthing squared. And that's the same thing\\nas negative 1 squared times 5x minus 3 squared. And negative 1 squared\\nis clearly equal to 1. That's why this and\\nthis are the same thing. This comes out to the same\\nthing as 5x minus 3 squared, which is the same thing\\nas that over there. Either of these are\\npossible answers. \",\n",
       " '13.8.3': '- [Voiceover] We wanna figure\\nout what AX plus B squared is, and I encourage you to pause the video and figure out what that is in terms of capital-A and capital-B. So let\\'s work through it. This is the same thing as multiplying AX plus B times AX plus B. So let me fill that in. This is AX there, another AX there. I just wrote it in that order to make the color switching\\na little bit easier. So AX plus B times AX plus B. Well, what\\'s that going to be equal to? Well, if you take this AX\\nand you multiply it times that AX, you\\'re going to get AX squared. AX, the entire thing squared. And then if you take, if you take this AX and then multiply it times this B, you\\'re going to get ABX. Then if you take this\\nB and you multiply it times this AX, you\\'re\\ngoing to get another ABX. ABX. And then last but not\\nleast, if you take this B and multiply it times the other B, it\\'s going to be plus B squared. And so what are you left with? Well, you\\'re going to be left with A, I\\'ll write it like this, AX squared, we actually if we want, well, I\\'ll write it in a\\ndifferent way in a second, and then you have plus, plus two, that\\'s a slightly different color. I\\'m gonna do that other color. Plus two ABX, and then finally plus B squared. Plus B squared. Now, I said I could write it\\nin a slightly different way, what I could do is just\\nrewrite-out AX squared as being the same thing. This is the same thing\\nas A-squared X-squared, and then I can write out\\neverything else the same way. Plus two ABX, and then plus B squared. Now, why did I, what\\'s\\ninteresting about doing this? Well, now we can see the pattern for the square of any binomial or binomial like this, so for example, if someone\\nwere to walk up to you and say \"alright, I have\\na trinomial of the form,\" let\\'s say they have a\\ntrinomial of the form 25X squared plus 20X plus 4, and they were to tell you to factor this, well, actually, let\\'s just do that. Why don\\'t you pause the video and see if you could factor this as\\nthe product of two binomials. Well, when you look at this, you\\'d say \"well look, there\\'s 25X squared, \"that looks like a perfect square. \"25X squared, that\\'s the\\nsame thing as five-squared \"x-squared,\" or you could write it as five X squared. This four here, that\\'s a perfect square. That\\'s the same thing as two squared. And let\\'s see, 20, right over here, if we want it to fit this pattern, we would see that A is five and B is two, and so let\\'s see, what\\nwould be two times AB? Well, five times two AB would be 10, and then two times that would be 20. So this right over here is, that is plus two times five. Two times five times two times two X. Times two X, I\\'ll do it in this color. Times two X. So you see that this completely\\nmatches this pattern here where A is equal to five\\nand B is equal to two. Once again, this is AX,\\nthe whole thing squared, then you have two times A times BX, you see that there, and then finally you have the B squared. So if you wanted to\\nfactor this, you could say \"well, this is just\\ngoing to the same thing \"since we know what A and B are, \"this is going to be five X plus two.\" Five X plus two. Five X plus two, whole thing squared. So the whole point of doing\\nthis is to start recognizing when we actually have perfect squares, especially perfect squares\\nwhere the leading coefficient isn\\'t one. ',\n",
       " '13.8.4': \"We need to factor negative 4t\\nsquared minus 12t minus 9. And a good place to start is\\nto say, well, are there any common factors for all\\nof these terms? When you look at them, well\\nthese first two are divisible by 4, these last 2 are divisible\\nby 3, but not all of them are divisible\\nany one number. Will, but you could factor out\\na negative 1, but even if you factor out a negative 1-- so you\\nsay this is the same thing as negative 1, times positive\\n4t squared plus 12t plus 9-- you still end up with a non-one\\ncoefficient out here and on the second degree term,\\non the t squared term. So you might want\\nto immediately start grouping this. And if you did factor it by\\ngrouping, it would work, you would get the right answer. But there is something about\\nthis equation that might pop out at you that might make it a\\nlittle bit simpler to solve. And to understand that, let's\\ntake a little bit of a break here on the right hand side,\\nand just think about what happens if you take a plus b\\ntimes a plus b, if you just have a binomial squared. Well you have a times a,\\nwhich is a squared. Then you have a times that\\nb, which is plus ab. Then you have b times a, which\\nis the same thing is ab. And then you have b times b,\\nor you have b squared. And so if you add these middle\\ntwo terms, right here, you're left with a squared plus\\n2ab plus b squared. This is the square\\nof a binomial. Now, does this right here, does\\n4t squared plus 12t plus 9 fit this pattern? Well the 4t squared\\nis a squared. So this right here\\nis a squared. If that is a squared right\\nthere, then what does a have to be? If this is a squared, then a\\nwould be equal to the square root of this. It would be 2t. And if this is b squared,\\nlet me do that in a different color. If this right here is b\\nsquared, if the 9 is b squared, right there,\\nthen that means that b is equal to 3. It's equal to the positive\\nsquare root of the 9. Now, this number, right here--\\nand actually it doesn't have to just be equal to 3,\\nit might have been negative 3 as well. It could be plus or minus 3. But this number here,\\nis it 2 times ab? Right? That's the middle term\\nthat we care about. Is it 2 times ab? Well if we multiply 2t\\ntimes 3, we get 6t. And then if we multiply that\\ntimes 2, you get 12t. This right here, 12t, is equal\\nto 2 times 2t times 3. It is 2 times ab. And if this was a negative 3,\\nwe would look to see if this was a negative 12, but this\\ndoes work for positive 3. So this it does fit the pattern\\nof a perfect square. This is a square\\nof a binomial. So if you wanted to factor\\nthis-- the stuff on the inside, you still have that\\nnegative 1 out there, the 4t squared plus 12t plus 9-- you\\ncould immediately say, well that's going to be a plus\\nb times a plus b. Or 2t plus 3 times 2t plus 3, or\\nyou could just say, it's 2t plus 3 squared. It fits this pattern. And, of course, you can't\\nforget about this negative 1 out here. You could have also solved it by\\ngrouping, but this might be a quicker thing to recognize. This is a number squared. That's another number squared. If you take each of those\\nnumbers that you're squaring, take their product and multiply\\nit by 2, you have that right there. So this is a perfect square. \",\n",
       " '13.8.5': \"- [Voiceover] The quadratic expression x-squared plus five x plus c is a perfect square. It can be factored as x plus d-squared. Both c and d are positive\\nrational numbers. What I wanna figure out in this video is what is c, given the information that we have right over here? What is c going to be equal to? And what is d going to be equal to? Like always, pause the video and see if you can figure it out. Let's work through this together. We're saying that x-squared\\nplus five x plus c can be rewritten as x plus d-squared. Let me write that down. So this part, this part, x-squared plus five x plus c, we're saying that, that could be written as x plus d-squared. This is equal to x plus d-squared. Now we can rewrite, x plus d-squared is going to be equal to x-squared plus two dx plus d-squared. If this step, right over\\nhere, you find strange, I encourage you to watch the videos on squaring binomials or on\\nperfect square polynomials, either one, so you can see the pattern that this is going to be. X squared plus two times the product of both of these terms plus d-squared. When you look at it like this, you can start to pattern\\nmatch a little bit. You can say, alright,\\nfive x, right over here, that is going to have\\nto be equal to two d, and then, you can also say, that c is going to have\\nto be equal to d-squared. Once again, you can say\\ntwo d is equal to five, two d is equal to five, or that d is equal to five halves. We've figured out what d is equal to. Now we can figure out what c is, because we know that c needs\\nto be equal to d-squared, gimme that orange color, actually, so we know that c is equal to d-squared, which is the same thing\\nas five halves, squared. We just figured out what d is equal to. Gonna be five halves, squared, which is going to be 25 over four. C is equal to 25 over four, d is equal to five halves. We're done. \",\n",
       " '13.8.6': '- [Voiceover] The quadratic\\nexpressions 4x squared, plus 12x, plus 9, and 4x squared minus 9, share a common binomial factor. What binomial factor do they share? And I encourage you to pause the video, see if you can figure it out. So, let\\'s do this by taking\\neach of these expressions, and trying to factor them into binomials, and then see if they share\\na common binomial factor. I guess they do share\\none, it\\'s to figure out which one they actually share. So, let\\'s focus first on this\\n4x squared, plus 12x, plus 9. So, the first thing that\\nmight jump out at you is, well let\\'s see, I have a\\n4 here, this coefficient on the x squared term,\\nthat\\'s a perfect square. I could write the entire 4x squared term, I could rewrite that\\nas 2x to the 2nd power, then out here, I have\\na constant term, the 9, that also is a perfect square. I could rewrite that as 3 squared. And you could say, \"Well,\\ngee, does this fit the pattern of a perfect square polynomial?\" In order for it to fit the pattern of a perfect square polynomial, the coefficient, here on the x term, would need to be 2 times the\\nproduct of this 2 and this 3, and it is, indeed, 2 times\\nthe product of 2 and 3. It is 2 times 6, so we\\ncould write this part, right over here, as 2 times 2, times that 2,\\ntimes 3, times that 3x, x. Then of course, we have to add\\nthese three things together, so plus, plus. And so just like that, we can recognize, hey, this is\\na perfect square polynomial, right over here. And if what I\\'m saying, right now, sounds like a little bit of voodoo, I encourage you to\\nwatch some of the videos on perfect square trinomials,\\nperfect square polynomials, some of the last two\\nvideos in this progression. So this this thing can be rewritten as the same thing as 2x\\nplus 3, 2x plus 3, squared, 2x plus 3, squared. Once again, because it\\'s of the form, you have the entire 2x squared here, you have the 3 squared here, and then this middle term\\nis 2 times the product of these two terms right over here, and so it definitely fit the pattern. So, there you have it. We factored the first expression, and now let\\'s try to factor\\nthe second expression. And, immediately when you see this one, it looks like it\\'s a\\ndifference of squares, so this one right over there, looks like a difference of squares to me. This, we can rewrite as 2x squared, minus, minus, look at that\\nnice color, minus 3 squared, so minus 3 squared. This is a difference of squares,\\nwe\\'ve seen multiple times, how to factor difference of squares. If this, again, looks foreign to you, I encourage you to watch those videos, and we explain how that\\nworks, and why it works. What is is going to be, when you have something in the form A squared, minus B squared, it\\'s going to be equal to\\nA plus B, times A minus B. So, this is going to be equal to, let me just put the two\\nbinomials right over here, so this is going to be A\\nplus B, times A minus B. So, this is going to be 2x\\nplus 3, times 2x minus 3. So, 2x plus 3, times 2x minus 3. And so, what is their\\ncommon binomial factor? Well, they both involve,\\nwhen you factor them out, they both have a binomial\\nfactor of 2x plus 3. This one right over here,\\nwe could rewrite if we want. We could rewrite it as 2x\\nplus 3, times 2x plus 3. That might\\'ve been somewhat\\nobvious to you already. So, 2x, 2x, then you have plus 3, plus 3, these two are equivalent. And so you see, we see, that\\nwe share in both of these, we share at least one,\\nor we share exactly one, 2x plus 3, so that\\'s the\\nbinomial factor that they share: 2x plus 3. ',\n",
       " '13.9.1': \"- [Instructor] We have other videos on individual techniques\\nfor factoring quadratics, but what I would like to do in this video is get some practice figuring out which technique to use, so I'm gonna write a bunch of quadratics, and I encourage you to pause the video, try to see if you can factor that quadratic yourself before I work through it with you. So the first quadratic\\nis 6x squared plus 3x. So pause and see if you can factor this. So this one might jump out at you that both of these terms\\nhere have a common factor. Both of them are divisible by three, six is divisible by three and so is three, and both of them are divisible by x, so you can factor out a 3x. So if you factor out a 3x, 6x squared divided by 3x, you're gonna\\nhave a 2x left over there and then 3x divided by 3x,\\nyou're going to have a one. And that's about as much as we can actually factor, and you can verify that these two expressions are the same if you distribute the 3x,\\n3x times 2x is 6x squared, 3x times one is 3x, and\\nthat's all we would do. We would be done. That's all you can\\nreally do to factor that. And as we'll see, in this example, trying to factor out a common factor was all we had to do, but as we'll see in future examples, that's\\nusually a good first step. Do all of, check whether the terms have a common factor, and if they do it never hurts to factor that out. So let's do another example. Let's say I have the quadratic\\n4x squared minus 4x minus 48. Pause the video and try to\\nfactor that as much as you can. Alright, so the first thing\\nyou might have noticed is that there is a common\\nfactor amongst the terms. All of them are divisible by four. Four is clearly divisible by four and 48 is also divisible by four. So let's factor a four out. This would be the same thing as four times x squared minus x minus 12. I just divided each of these\\nby four and I factored it out. You can distribute the four and verify that these two expressions are the same. Now are we done? Well no, we can factor what we have inside the parentheses, we\\ncan factor this further. Now how would we do that? So over here the key realization is alright, I have a one as a coefficient on my second degree term. I've written it in standard form where I have the second degree and then if there's a first degree term, and then I have my constant term or my zero degree term, and if I have a one coefficient right over here then I say, okay, are there two numbers whose sum equals the coefficient on the first degree term, on the x term, so are there two numbers\\nthat add up to negative one? You didn't see a one here\\nbefore but it's implicit there. Negative x is the same\\nthing as negative 1x. So are there two numbers, a plus b, that is equal to negative one and whose product is equal to negative 12? This is a technique that\\nwe do in other videos, and here the key is to realize that hey, maybe we can use it here. So a times be is equal to negative 12. And there's a couple of\\nkey realizations here. It's like, okay, if I have two numbers and their product is\\ngoing to be a negative that means one of them, that means they're gonna have different signs. One's going to be positive and\\none's going to be negative. If they had the same sign\\nthen this would be positive. So let's think about the factors of 12, and especially think about them in terms of different sign combinations. So you could think about one and 12, and whether you're\\nthinking about negative one and 12, negative one plus\\n12 would be positive 11. If you went the other way around, if you went negative 12 and\\none it would be negative 11, but either way that doesn't work. Two and six, negative two and six would be four, negative six and two would be negative four,\\nso that doesn't work. Three and four. Let's see, negative three and four would be positive one, but three and negative four works out. You add these two together, you take their product, you clearly get negative 12 and then you add them\\ntogether, you get negative one. So we can write inside the parentheses, so let me write, so this is gonna be four times, so we can factor\\nthat as two binomials. The first is going to be x plus, the first is going to be x plus three and then the next is going to be, we could say x plus negative four or we could say x minus\\nfour, and we're done. And if any of this seems\\nintimidating to you I encourage you to watch the videos on introduction to factoring polynomials. The key here is to recognize the method. So once again, at first try to factor out any common factors. We did that in both examples. And then we saw here, hey if we have a leading one coefficient here on the second degree term and we have it written in standard form, well let's think of two numbers that add up to this coefficient and whose product is equal to the constant\\nterm, and in this case it was three and negative four, we were able to factor it this way. We prove that in other videos. Let's do another example. We can't get enough\\npractice, and like always, pause the video and see if you\\ncan work through it yourself. Three x squared, plus 30, plus 75. Alright, I'm assuming you had a go at it. So you might immediately see that all of the terms are divisible by three, so let's factor three\\nout, so it's gonna be three times x squared plus, oh whoops, this should be an x here, my apologies. Pause the video again and\\nsee if you can do it (laughs) now that I wrote the\\nactual right thing there. So as you imagine it's nice to factor out a three first, so it's\\nthree times x squared, plus 10x, plus 25, and so you might immediately say alright, let's use the technique we had here. We have a leading one coefficient, it's written in standard form. Can I think of two numbers\\nthat add up to ten, so a plus b is equal to\\n10, and whose product, a times b, is equal to 25? And this would work. And if you look at the factors of 25 you'd say, alright, well this thing here is positive, this is positive, so I'm dealing with two positive numbers and to get 25 it's either a one and 25 or five and five, and\\nfive and five match this. Five plus five is equal to 10. Five times five is equal to 25. And so just using the exact technique we just did, you'd say\\nokay this is three times and the stuff in parentheses would be x plus five times x plus five, or you could say three\\ntimes x plus five squared. So some of you might\\nhave immediately said, well I don't have to do\\nthat exact technique. I could have immediately recognized this as a perfect square\\nbecause I have a square constant right over here, and that's a good sign that hey,\\nmaybe I should explore whether this is going to be\\na perfect square polynomial. So this is a perfect square, and if I were to take the square root of\\nit, and this coefficient is twice that square root, well that's a good sign that I'm probably dealing, or that I am dealing\\nwith a perfect square. But either way, whether you recognize it as a perfect square or\\nwhether you use the technique that we used in the second problem, either one of those would get\\nyou to the appropriate answer. \",\n",
       " '13.9.2': '- [Sal] In the last video we looked at three different\\nexamples, really as a bit of a review of some of\\nour factoring techniques, and also to appreciate when\\nwe might wanna apply them. We saw in the first\\nexample that it was just a process of recognizing a common factor. Once we factored that out, we were done. In the second example, there\\nwas a common factor, four. Then, after that, we used, you could say, our most basic factoring technique, or one of our more basic\\nfactoring techniques, where we say, what two numbers add up to the first-degree coefficient, and then their product is the constant. And we were able to factor the expression. Then, in the third\\nexample, we, once again, started off by factoring\\nout a common value, which, in this case, was three. We could\\'ve done it the same\\nway we did the second one, or we could\\'ve immediately recognized that this is a perfect-square polynomial. But either way, we were able\\nto factor the expression. Let\\'s keep going to see if we\\ncan tackle some other types of polynomials that might\\nrequire some other techniques. Let\\'s say we have the expression seven x squared minus 63. Like always, pause this video, and see if you can factor that. I\\'ve intentionally designed\\nall of these so that you can check whether there\\'s a\\ncommon factor across the terms, and here they\\'re all divisible by seven. If you factor out a seven, you\\'re gonna get seven times x-squared minus nine. You might immediately recognize this as a difference of squares. You have x squared minus\\nthis right over here is three squared. Minus three squared. If the term difference of\\nsquares or how to factor them is completely foreign to\\nyou, I encourage you to watch the videos on factoring\\ndifference of squares or do a search on Khan Academy\\nfor difference of squares. But you will see, when you have a difference of squares like this, it can be factored as seven,\\nthis is just a seven out front, and then this part right over\\nhere, get a different color, this part right over here can be written as x plus three times x minus three. It is x squared minus three squared. Now, one thing to appreciate. This really isn\\'t a different technique than the one that we saw\\nin the previous video. If we just focused on\\nx squared minus nine, you could view this as x\\nsquared plus zero x minus nine. In that case, you\\'d say:\\n\"OK, what two numbers \"get me a product of negative\\nnine and add up to zero?\" If I need to get a\\nproduct of negative nine, that means that they\\nmust be different signs, a positive and a negative; otherwise, if they were the same sign,\\nyou\\'d get a positive here. So they\\'re different signs. Nine only has three factors. One. You could either have one and nine. There\\'s only two combinations here. You could either have one or\\nnine, and three and three. And, if you make one\\nnegative or nine negative, that\\'s not going to add up to zero. But if you make one of\\nthese threes negative, that does add up to zero. Say, OK, my two numbers are gonna be negative three and three. So it\\'s gonna be x minus\\nthree times x plus three. Once again, I\\'m just focusing on what was inside the parentheses\\nright over here. You\\'d put that seven out front if we were doing this\\nexact same expression. But if you recognize it as\\na difference of squares, it might happen for you\\na little bit faster. Let\\'s do one more example. Let\\'s say that I have two x\\nsquared plus seven x plus three. In general, when my coefficient on the second-degree\\nterm here is not a one, I try to see is there\\na common factor here. But, seven isn\\'t divisible\\nby two, and neither is three. So I can\\'t use the techniques that I used in the last few videos or even over here, where I say: \"Oh,\\nthere\\'s a common factor\", and get a leading coefficient of one. If you see a situation like that, it\\'s a clue that factoring\\nby grouping might apply here. Factoring by grouping. On some level, everything\\nthat we\\'ve just done now you could view as special\\ncases of factoring by grouping. Factoring by grouping, you say, OK, can I think of two numbers that\\nadd up to this coefficient. a plus b is equal to seven. a times b, instead of just\\nsaying it needs to equal to three, it actually needs to\\nbe equal to three times this, three times the leading coefficient, the coefficient on the x-squared term. It needs to be equal to three times two. If you think about it, we\\'ve\\nalways been doing that. The other examples we gave, the leading coefficient was a one. When you took the constant term,\\nand multiplied it by a one, you were just saying a times b needs to be equal to that constant term. If you wanna talk about it more generally, it should be a times b\\nshould be the constant term times the leading coefficient. In the introduction to\\nfactoring by grouping we explained why that works. You should never just accept\\nthis as some magic formula. It makes sense for a very\\ngood mathematical reason. But once you accept that, then it\\'s useful to be able\\nto apply the technique. So can we think of two\\nnumbers that add up to seven and whose product is equal to six? They\\'re going to have to be the same sign since this is a positive value. And, they\\'re gonna be positive\\n\\'cause they\\'re the same sign, and if they\\'re adding\\nup to a positive value, they\\'re both gonna be positive. Well, let\\'s see, one\\nand six seems to work. One plus six is seven. One times six is six. In factoring by grouping\\nwe rewrite our expression where we break this up\\nbetween the a and the b. So I can rewrite this as two x squared plus six x plus, I could write one x. Actually, lemme just do that. Plus one x plus three. As you can see, the\\nseven x, different color, the seven x has been broken\\nup into the six x and one x. That whole exercise I\\njust did is to see how we can break up this first-degree\\nterm right over here. But then, what\\'s useful\\nabout this, is now, we can do the reverse of the\\ndistributive property twice. So, for these first two terms, in a different color than I just use, these first two terms,\\nyou see a common factor. Two x squared and six x,\\nthey\\'re both divisible by two x. So let\\'s factor out a two x\\noutta those first two terms. If you do that, two x\\nsquared divided by two x, you\\'re just gonna have an x left over. Six x divided by two x, you\\'re\\njust going to have a three. And then you have plus. Over here, this is a\\nspecial situation where, x plus three, there is no common\\nfactor between x and three, so we\\'ll just rewrite that, x plus three. When I put a parentheses on it, which is equivalent to writing\\nit without a parentheses, you might see something else. I can undistribute, or I can\\nfactor out, an x plus three. What happens if I do that? I\\'m gonna get an x plus three. And then I\\'m gonna have\\nleftover in this term, if I factored out an x plus three, I\\'m just gonna have a two x left over. Two x. And then, this term, if I\\nfactor out an x plus three, I\\'m just gonna have a one left over. Plus one. Lemme do it in that same color. Having trouble switching colors today. Two x plus one. And we are done. So, as I said, these are\\nall various techniques. On some level, factoring by grouping is sometimes viewed as the hardest one. But I\\'ll say hard in parentheses because everything we did is\\njust a variation, really, a special case, of factoring by grouping. As you can see, it\\'s all about, two numbers that add up\\nto that middle coefficient on the first-degree term when\\nit\\'s written in standard form. Their product is equal to the product of the constant and the\\nleading coefficient. If you do that, you\\nbreak it up, it works out quite nicely where you\\nkeep factoring out terms. This one, on some levels,\\nwas a little bit more subtle, \\'cause you had to recognize\\nthat this x plus three has a one coefficient on there implicitly. One times x plus three is the\\nsame thing as x plus three. And then see that you can\\nfactor out an x plus three outta both of these terms,\\nand then, once you do that, you\\'re gonna be left\\nwith the two x plus one. But all of these, if you\\nreally feel comfortable with this arsenal of techniques, you\\'re gonna do pretty well. Frankly, if none of these work, well, you might already be familiar\\nwith the quadratic formula or you might be soon to learn it, but that\\'s when the quadratic\\nformula might be effective if none of these techniques work. ',\n",
       " '14.1.1': \"- [Instructor] In this video,\\nwe are going to talk about one of the most common types\\nof curves you will see in mathematics, and that is the parabola. The word parabola sounds\\nquite fancy, but we'll see it's describing something that\\nis fairly straightforward. Now in terms of why it\\nis called the parabola, I've seen multiple explanations for it. It comes from Greek para, that root word, similar to parable. You could view of something beside, alongside, something in parallel. Bola, same root as when we're talking about ballistics, throwing something. So you could interpret\\nit as beside, alongside, something that is being thrown. Now how does that relate\\nto curves like this? Well my brain immediately\\nimagines this is the trajectory, this is the path that is a\\npretty good approximation for the path of things\\nthat are actually thrown. When you study physics, you will see the path, you'll approximate, the paths of objects being\\nthrown, as parabolas, so maybe that's where it comes from, but there are other potential explanations for why it is actually\\ncalled the parabola. It has been lost to history. But what exactly is a parabola? In future videos, we're gonna describe it a little bit more algebraically. In this one, we just wanna get a sense for what parabolas look\\nlike and introduce ourselves to some terminology around a parabola. These three curves, they\\nare all hand-drawn versions of a parabola, and so\\nyou immediately notice some interesting things about them. Some of them are opened\\nupwards like this yellow one and this pink one, and some\\nof them are open downwards. You will hear people say\\nthings like open, opened down, open downwards or open\\ndown or open upwards, so it's good to know what\\nthey are talking about, and it's, hopefully,\\nfairly self-explanatory. Open upwards, the parabola is open towards the top of our graph paper. Here it's open towards the\\nbottom of our graph paper. This looks like a right-side up U. This looks like an upside\\ndown U right over here. This pink one would be open upwards. Now another term that\\nyou'll see associated with the parabola, and\\nonce again, in the future, we'll learn how to calculate these things and find them precisely, is the vertex. The vertex you should view as the maximum or minimum point on a parabola. So if a parabola opens upwards\\nlike these two on the right, the vertex is the minimum point. The vertex is the minimum\\npoint right over there, and so if someone said what is the vertex of this yellow parabola? Well it looks like the x,\\nlooks like the x coordinate is three and a half, so\\nit is three and a half. It looks like the y\\ncoordinate, it looks like it is about negative three and a half. Once again, once we start\\nrepresenting these things with equations, we'll have techniques for calculating them more\\nprecisely, but the vertex of this other upward-opening parabola, it is the minimum point. It is the low point. There is no maximum point on\\nan upward-opening parabola. It just keeps increasing as x gets larger in the positive or the negative direction. Now if your parabola opens downward, then your vertex is going\\nto be your maximum point. Now related to the idea\\nof a vertex is the idea of an axis of symmetry. In general when we're talking\\nabout, well not just three, two dimensions but even three dimensions, but especially in two dimensions,\\nyou can imagine a line over which you can flip the graph, and so it meets, it folds onto itself. The axis of symmetry for this\\nyellow graph right over here, for this yellow parabola,\\nit would be this line. I'm gonna have to draw\\nit a little bit better. It would be that line right over there. You could fold the\\nparabola over that line, and it would meet itself. And that line, I didn't\\ndraw it as neat as I should, that should go directly\\nthrough the vertex, so to describe that line you'd say that line is x is equal to 3.5. Similarly the axis of symmetry\\nfor this pink parabola, it should go through the\\nline x equals negative one, so let me do that. That's the axis of symmetry. It goes through the\\nvertex, and if you were to fold the parabola over\\nit, it would meet itself. The axis of symmetry for this green one? It should, once again,\\ngo through the vertex. It looks like it is x is\\nequal to negative six. This is, let me write that down, that is the axis of symmetry. Now another concept that\\nisn't unique to parabolas, but we'll talk a lot about it\\nin the context of parabolas, are intercepts, so when\\npeople say y-intercept, and you saw this when\\nyou first graphed lines, they're saying where is the graph, where does the curve intercept\\nor intersect the y-axis? So the y-intercept of this\\nyellow line would be right there. It looks like it's the\\npoint zero comma three, zero comma three. The y-intercept for the pink\\none is right over there. At least on this graph paper,\\nwe don't see the y-intercept, but it eventually will\\nintersect the y-axis. It just will be way off of this screen. You might also be familiar\\nwith the term x-intercept, and that's especially\\ninteresting with parabolas as we'll see in the future. X-intercept is where do you intercept or intersect the x-axis? Here this yellow one you\\nsee it does it two places, and this is where it gets interesting. Lines will only intersect\\nthe x-axis once at most, but here we see that a\\nparabola can intersect the x-axis twice, because\\nit curves back around to intersect it again, and so for here the x-intercepts are going to be the point one comma zero and six comma zero. You might already notice\\nsomething interesting. The x-intercepts are symmetric\\naround the axis of symmetry, so they should be equal distant\\nfrom that axis of symmetry, and you can see they indeed are. They are both exactly two and a half away from that axis of symmetry,\\nand so if you know where the intercepts are,\\nyou just take, you could say, the midpoint of the x\\ncoordinates, and then you're going to have the axis of\\nsymmetry, the x coordinate of the axis of symmetry\\nand the x coordinate of the actual vertex. Similarly the x-intercept\\nhere looks like it's negative, the points are negative seven comma zero and negative five comma zero, and the x coordinate of the\\nvertex, or the line of symmetry, is right in between those two points. It's worth noting not\\nevery parabola is going to intersect the x-axis. Notice this pink upward-opening parabola, it's low point is above the x-axis, so it's never going to\\nintersect the actual x-axis, so this is actually not going\\nto have any x-intercepts. I'll leave you there. Those are actually the core\\nideas or the core visual themes around parabolas, and\\nwe're going to discuss them in a lot more detail when we\\nrepresent them with equations. As you'll see, these equations are going to involve second-degree terms. So the most simple parabola is going to be y is equal to x squared, but then you can\\ncomplicate it a little bit. You could have things like y is equal to two x squared minus five x plus seven. These types that we'll talk\\nabout in more general terms, these types of equations\\nsometimes called quadratics, they are represented,\\ngenerally, by parabolas. \",\n",
       " '14.1.2': \"- [Instructor] We're told that Adam flew his remote controlled\\ndrone off of a platform. The function f models\\nthe height of the drone above the ground, in meters, as a function of time, in\\nseconds, after takeoff. So what they want us\\nto do is plot the point on the graph of f that corresponds to each of the following things. So pause the video and\\nsee if you can do that, and, obviously, you can't\\ndraw on your screen. This is from an exercise on Khan Academy, but you can visually look at it, and even with your\\nfinger, point to the part of the graph of f that\\nrepresents each of these things. All right, so the first thing here is the height of the platform. So the drone is at the\\nheight of the platform right when it takes off, 'cause it says Adam flew\\nhis remote controlled drone off of a platform. So what is the time that he's taking off, the drone, or the drone is taking off? Well, that's going to\\nbe at time t equals zero right over here. And what is the height of\\nthe drone at that moment? It is 60 meters. So that must be the\\nheight of the platform. So that point right over there tells us the height of the platform. And if they asked us what the\\nheight of the platform is, it would be 60 meters. The next one is the\\ndrone's maximum height. So then as time goes on, we can see the drone starts going to a higher and higher and higher height, gets as high as 80 meters. And then it starts going down. So it looks like 80\\nmeters, at time 10 seconds, the drone hits a maximum\\nheight of 80 meters. And then last but not least, they say the time when the\\ndrone landed on the ground. Now, we can assume that the ground is when the height of the\\ndrone is at zero meters, and we can see that that\\nhappens right over here. And that happens at time\\nt equals 30 seconds. And so we've just marked it off, and I know what some of\\nyou all are thinking. Wait, there's another time where the drone's height is at zero, and that's right over here. That's at negative 10 seconds. Couldn't we say that that's also a time when the drone landed on the ground? And this is a important point to realize, because if we're really trying to model the drone's behavior from time t equals zero, if t equals zero is\\nright when you take off all the way to it lands, then this parabola that we're\\nshowing right over here, it actually, we would probably want to restrict its domain to positive times. And so this negative time\\nregion right over here really doesn't make a lot of sense. We should probably consider\\nthe non-negative values of time when we're trying to think about these different thins. \",\n",
       " '14.1.3': \"- [Instructor] Katie\\nthrows a ball in the air for her dog to chase. The function f models the\\nheight of the ball, in meters, as a function of time, in\\nseconds, after Katie threw it. And we could see that right over here. This is our function f. So at time t equals zero, the height looks like\\nit's a couple of meters. And then as we go forward in time, to a little under 2 1/2\\nseconds, the ball's going up. And then after a little\\nunder 2 1/2 seconds, the ball starts going down. And after, by the time you get to five seconds or close to five seconds, it looks like the ball is on the ground. Its height is zero meters. So then they ask us which of these statements are true? Choose all that apply. So pause this video, and\\nsee if you can work it out. All right, now let's\\nlook through the choices. So the first one says Katie threw the ball from a height of five meters. So let's see if that bears fruit or (chuckles) see if that's true. So if she threw it from\\na height of five meters, that means that the y-intercept would've been at five meters. At time t equals zero, we would've been at a\\nheight of five meters. Clearly, that is not the y-intercept. It looks like she threw it from a height of maybe 1 1/2 or two meters. So I'm assuming that Katie\\nis not five meters tall. So she wasn't on a ladder or anything. She just threw it from her regular height. And so we can rule out this first choice. The second one says at its highest point, the ball was about 31\\nmeters above the ground. Let's see if that is true. So the highest point is right over here. And yeah, that looks about 31 meters, so I like that choice. So I will select that one. The ball was in the air\\nfor about 2 1/2 seconds. So we can clearly see\\nthat that is not the case. The ball was going up for about 2 1/2 seconds,\\nbut then it was going down for roughly another 2 1/2 seconds. And so it was actually in the\\nair for almost five seconds. So I would rule this one out. The ball reached its\\nhighest point in the air about 2 1/2 seconds after Katie threw it. So let's see, after Katie, 2 1/2 seconds after Katie threw the ball, it's right over there. It looks like it reached its highest point a little bit before that. But they said about, so they're\\nspeaking in rough terms. So I think that statement can be true. It's about 2 1/2 seconds. If they said exactly 2 1/2 seconds, I wouldn't have selected it\\n'cause it seems like it happened at like 2.45 seconds\\nor something like that. But there you go, those are\\nthe ones that seem true. \",\n",
       " '14.2.1': '- [Instructor] Let\\'s say\\nthat we\\'ve got the equation two X minus one times X plus four is equal to zero. Pause this video and see\\nif you can figure out the X values that would\\nsatisfy this equation, essentially our solutions\\nto this equation. Alright, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. So at first, you might be tempted to multiply these things out, or there\\'s multiple ways that you might have tried to approach it, but the key realization here is that you have two\\nthings being multiplied, and it\\'s being equal to zero. So you have the first\\nthing being multiplied is two X minus one. This is expression is being multiplied by X plus four, and to get it to be equal to zero, one or both of these expressions needs to be equal to zero. Let me really reinforce that idea. If I had two variables, let\\'s say A and B, and I told you A times B is equal to zero. Well, can you get the\\nproduct of two numbers to equal zero without at least one of them being equal to zero? And the simple answer is no. If A is seven, the only way that you would get zero is if B is zero, or if B was five, the only way to get zero is if A is zero. So you see from this example, either, let me write this down, either A or B or both, \\'cause zero times zero is zero, or both must be zero. The only way that you get the\\nproduct of two quantities, and you get zero, is if one or both of\\nthem is equal to zero. I really wanna reinforce this idea. I\\'m gonna put a red box around it so that it really gets\\nstuck in your brain, and I want you to think about why that is. Try to come up with two numbers. Try to multiply them so that you get zero, and you\\'re gonna see\\nthat one of those numbers is going to need to be zero. So we\\'re gonna use this\\nidea right over here. Now this might look a\\nlittle bit different, but you could view two\\nX minus one as our A, and you could view X plus four as our B. So either two X minus one\\nneeds to be equal to zero, or X plus four needs to be equal to zero, or both of them needs to be equal to zero. So I could write that as two X minus one needs to be equal to zero, or X plus four, or X, let me do that orange. Actually, let me do the two X minus one in that yellow color. So either two X minus\\none is equal to zero, or X plus four is equal to zero. X plus four is equal to zero, and so let\\'s solve each of these. If two X minus one could be equal to zero, well, let\\'s see, you could\\nadd one to both sides, and we get two X is equal to one. Divide both sides by two, and this just straightforward solving a linear equation. If this looks unfamiliar, I encourage you to watch videos on solving linear\\nequations on Khan Academy, but you\\'ll get X is equal\\nto 1/2 as one solution. This is interesting \\'cause we\\'re gonna have\\ntwo solutions here, or over here, if we wanna solve for X, we can subtract four from both sides, and we would get X is\\nequal to negative four. So it\\'s neat. In an equation like this, you can actually have two solutions. X could be equal to 1/2, or X could be equal to negative four. I think it\\'s pretty interesting to substitute either one of these in. If X is equal to 1/2, what is going to happen? Well, this is going to be\\ntwo times 1/2 minus one, two times 1/2 minus one. That\\'s going to be our first expression, and then our second expression\\nis going to be 1/2 plus four. And so what\\'s this going to be equal to? Well, two times 1/2 is one. One minus one is zero, so I don\\'t care what you have over here. Zero times anything is\\ngoing to be equal to zero. So when X equals 1/2, the first thing becomes zero, making everything, making\\nthe product equal zero. And likewise, if X equals negative four, it\\'s pretty clear that\\nthis second expression is going to be zero, and even though this first expression isn\\'t going to be zero in that case, anything times zero is going to be zero. Let\\'s do one more example here. So let me delete out everything\\nthat I just wrote here, and so I\\'m gonna involve a function. So let\\'s say someone told you that F of X is equal to X minus five, times five X, plus two, and someone said, \"Find\\nthe zeros of F of X.\" Well, the zeros are, what are the X values that make F of X equal to zero? When does F of X equal zero? For what X values does F of X equal zero? That\\'s what people are really asking when they say, \"Find the zeros of F of X.\" So to do that, well, when\\ndoes F of X equal zero? Well, F of X is equal to zero when this expression right over here is equal to zero, and so it sets up just like\\nthe equation we just saw. X minus five times five X plus two, when does that equal zero? And like we saw before, well, this is just like\\nwhat we saw before, and I encourage you to pause the video, and try to work it out on your own. So there\\'s two situations where this could happen, where either the first\\nexpression equals zero, or the second expression, or maybe in some cases, you\\'ll have a situation where\\nboth expressions equal zero. So we could say either X\\nminus five is equal to zero, or five X plus two is equal to zero. I\\'ll write an, or, right over here. Now if we solve for X, you add five to both\\nsides of this equation. You get X is equal to five. Here, let\\'s see. To solve for X, you could subtract two from both sides. You get five X is equal to negative two, and you could divide both sides by five to solve for X, and you get X is equal to negative 2/5. So here are two zeros. You input either one of these into F of X. If you input X equals five, if you take F of five, if you try to evaluate F of five, then this first\\nexpression\\'s gonna be zero, and so a product of\\nzero and something else, it doesn\\'t matter that\\nthis is gonna be 27. Zero times 27 is zero, and if you take F of negative 2/5, it doesn\\'t matter what\\nthis first expression is. The second expression right over here is gonna be zero. Zero times anything is zero. ',\n",
       " '14.2.2': \"- [Instructor] We're asked\\nto graph the equation y is equal to one-half times x minus six times x plus two. So like always, pause this video and take out some graph paper or even try to do it on\\na regular piece of paper and see if you can graph this equation. All right now, let's work\\nthrough this together. There's many different ways that you could attempt to graph it. May be the most basic is\\ntry out a bunch of x values and a bunch of y values and\\ntry to connect the curve that connects all of those dots. But let's try to see if\\nwe can get the essence of this graph without\\ndoing that much work. The key realization here without\\neven having to do the math is if I multiply this out, if I multiplied x minus\\nsix times x plus two, I'm going to get a quadratic. I'm going to get x-squared, plus something, plus something else. And so this whole thing\\nis going to be a parabola. We are graphing a quadratic equation. Now a parabola you might remember can intersect the x-axis multiple times. So let's see if we can find out where this intersects the x-axis. And the form that it's in, it's in factored form already, it makes it pretty straightforward for us to recognize\\nwhen does y equal zero? Which are going to be the\\ntimes that we're intersecting the x-axis. And then from that, we'll\\nactually be able to find the coordinates of the vertex and we're going to be able\\nto get the general shape of this curve which is\\ngoing to be a parabola. So let's think about it. When does y equal zero? Well to solve that we just\\nhave to figure out when, if we want to know when y equals zero, then we have to solve for when does this expression equal zero? So let's just solve the equation. One half times x minus six, times x plus two is equal to zero. Now in previous videos we've\\ntalked about this idea. If I have the product of multiple things and it needs to be equal to zero, the only way that's going to happen is if one or more of these things are going to be equal to zero. Well one half is one-half, it's not going to be equal to zero. But x minus six could be equal to zero. So if x minus six is equal to zero, then that would make this equation true. Or if x plus two is equal to zero, that would also make this equation true. So the x values that\\nsatisfy either of these would make y equal zero\\nand those would be places where our curve is\\nintersecting the x-axis. So what x value makes\\nx minus six equal zero? Well you could add six to both sides, you're probably able to\\ndo that in your head, and you get x is equal to six. Or you subtract two from both sides here and you get x is equal to, these cancel out, you get x is equal to negative two. These are the two x values where y will be equal to zero. You can substitute it back\\ninto our original equation. If x is equal to six, then this right over here is\\ngoing to be equal to zero, and then y is going to be equal to zero. If x is equal to negative two, then this right over here is\\ngoing to be equal to zero, and y would be equal to zero. So we know that our parabola\\nis going to intersect the x-axis at x equals\\nnegative two right over there, and x is equal to six. These are our x-intercepts. So given this, how do we\\nfigure out the vertex? Well the key idea here is to recognize that your axis of\\nsymmetry for your parabola is going to sit right between\\nyour two x-intercepts. So what is the midpoint between, or what is the average\\nof six and negative two? Well, you could do that in your head. Six plus negative two is\\nfour divided by two is two. Let me do that. So I'm just trying to find the\\nmidpoint between the point, let's use a new color. So I'm trying to find the midpoint between the point negative two comma zero and six comma zero. Well the midpoint, those are just the average of the coordinates. The average of zero and zero\\nis just going to be zero, it's going to sit on the x-axis. But then the midpoint\\nof negative two and six or the average negative\\ntwo plus six over two. Well let's see, that's four over two, that's just going to be two, so two comma zero. And you see that there. You could have done that\\nwithout even doing the math. You say okay, if I want to go right in between the two, I want to be two away from each of them. And so just like that,\\nI could draw an axis of symmetry for my parabola. So my vertex is going to sit\\non that axis of symmetry. And so how do I know what the y value is? Well I can figure out, I can substitute back\\nin my original equation, and say well what is y equal\\nwhen x is equal to two? Because remember the vertex\\nhas a coordinate x equals two. It's going to be two comma something. So let's go back, let's see what y equals. So y will equal to one-half times, we're going to see when x equals two, so two minus six, times two plus two. Let's see, this is negative four, this is positive four. Negative four times four is negative 16. So it's equal to one-half\\ntimes negative 16, which is equal to negative eight. So our vertex when x is equal to two, y is equal to negative eight. And so our vertex is going\\nto be right over here two common negative eight. And now we can draw the general shape of our actual parabola. It's going to look something like, once again this is a hand-drawn sketch, so take it with a little\\nbit of a grain of salt, but it's going to look\\nsomething like this. And it's going to be symmetric\\naround our axis of symmetry. That's why it's called\\nthe axis of symmetry. This art program I have,\\nthere's a symmetry tool, but I'll just use this and there you go. That's a pretty good sketch\\nof what this parabola is or what this graph is going\\nto look like which it is, an upward-opening parabola. \",\n",
       " '14.2.3': '- [Instructor] We are\\ntold a rocket is launched from a platform. Its height in meters, x seconds\\nafter the launch is modeled by h of x is equal to\\nnegative four times x plus two times x minus 18. Now, the first thing they\\nask us is what is the height of the rocket at the time of launch? Pause the video and see if\\nyou can figure that out. Well, what is x at the time of launch? Well, x is the number of\\nseconds after the launch, so at the time of launch, x\\nwould be equal to zero. The height of the rocket when\\nx is equal to zero, they\\'re essentially saying,\\n\"Well, what is h of zero?\" To figure out h of zero, we\\njust have to go back to this expression and replace\\nall the xs with zeros. H of zero is going to be equal\\nto negative four, negative four times zero plus two,\\nwhich is just going to be two times zero minus 18,\\nwhich is just going to be negative 18. Let\\'s see, this is going\\nto be negative eight times negative 18, negative\\neight times negative 18, which is the same thing as negative eight times negative nine times two. This is going to be positive 72 times two, which is 144, so 144 meters. Did I do that right? Let\\'s see. We\\'re going to have ... Yep that sounds right. That\\'s right. How many seconds after\\nlaunch will the rocket hit the ground? Pause this video again and\\nsee if you can answer that. Well, what does it mean for\\nthe rocket to hit the ground? That means that the height is\\nequal to zero, so if you want to figure out how many\\nseconds after launch, how many seconds that\\'s x, so we want\\nto figure out the x when our height is equal to zero. We can set up an equation. Let\\'s make our height h of\\nx equal to zero, so zero is equal to negative four times x plus two times x minus 18. Well, if you have the product\\nof three different things being equal to zero, the way\\nyou get this to be equal to zero is if at least one of these three\\nthings is equal to zero. Well, negative four can\\'t be\\nequal to zero, so we could say x plus two equals zero. I got that from right over here. If x plus two were equaling\\nto zero, then this equation would be satisfied. That would be the situation\\nwhen x is equal to negative two, but remember x is the\\nnumber of seconds after the launch, so a negative\\nx would mean be going before the launch. We can rule that one out. Then, we could also think\\nabout, \"Well, x minus 18 if \"that\\'s equal to zero,\\nthen this entire expression \"could be equal to zero.\" X minus 18 equals zero,\\nyou add 18 to both sides. You get x is equal to 18, so 18 seconds after launch, well we\\'re going forward in time. 18 seconds after launch, we see that our height is zero, we have hit the ground. Next question, how many seconds\\nafter being launched will the rocket reach its maximum height? Pause the video again and see\\nif you can figure that out. Well, the key realization here is if you have a curve, if you have a parabola in\\nparticular and it\\'s going to look something like this, if you\\'re\\ngonna have a parabola that looks something like this,\\nyou\\'re going to hit your maximum height right over here\\nbetween your two zeros or between the two times\\nthat your height is zero. If you figure out this x\\nvalue and this x value, the average of the two will give\\nyou your x value the time after launch, when you\\'re\\nat your maximum height. Well, we already figured out\\nwhat this x-value is and what this x-value is. We know that h of x is equal\\nto zero when x is either equal to 18, so that is x is equal to 18 or x is equal to negative two, so that is x is equal to negative two. To answer this question, we\\njust have to go halfway between negative two and 18, so let\\'s do that. Negative two plus 18 divided by two gets us what? That\\'s going to be 16 over\\ntwo, which is going to be equal to eight. This is right over here. This is x equals eight\\nseconds the rocket is at its maximum height. Last question, what is the\\nmaximum height that the rocket will reach? Once again, pause the video\\nand try to answer that. Well, we already know from\\nthe previous question that we reach our maximum height\\nwhen x is equal to eight, eight seconds after launch. To figure out the height\\nthen, we just have to evaluate what h of eight is, h of eight. Remember that\\'s what this\\nfunction does, you give me any x value, any elapsed time after\\nlaunch and it will give me the height, so eight seconds\\nafter launch, I know I have maximum height. To figure out that height,\\nI just input it into the function, so h of eight is\\ngoing to be equal to negative four times eight plus two times eight minus 18. Eight plus two is 10. Eight minus 18 is negative 10. You have negative four times negative 100, so that\\'s\\ngoing to be positive 400. H is given in meters, so\\nthat\\'s its maximum height, 400 meters. ',\n",
       " '14.3.1': \"We're asked to\\nsolve the equation 2x squared plus\\n3 is equal to 75. So in this situation,\\nit looks like we might be able to isolate\\nthe x squared pretty simply. Because there's only one\\nterm that involves an x here. It's only this x squared term. So let's try to do that. So let me just rewrite it. We have 2x squared\\nplus 3 is equal to 75. And we're going to try to\\nisolate this x squared over here. And the best way to do that,\\nor at least the first step, would be to subtract 3 from\\nboth sides of this equation. So let's subtract\\n3 from both sides. The left hand side, we're\\njust left with 2x squared. That was the whole point of\\nsubtracting 3 from both sides. And on the right hand\\nside, 75 minus 3 is 72. Now, I want to isolate\\nthis x squared. I have a 2x squared here. So I could have just\\nan x squared here if I divide this side or\\nreally both sides by 2. Anything I do to one side, I\\nhave to do to the other side if I want to maintain\\nthe equality. So the left side, just\\nbecomes x squared. And the right hand side\\nis 72 divided by 2 is 36. So we're left with x\\nsquared is equal to 36. And then to solve for x,\\nwe can take the positive, the plus or minus square\\nroot of both sides. So we could say the plus or--\\nlet me write it this way-- If we take the square\\nroot of both sides, we would get x is equal to\\nthe plus or minus square root of 36, which is equal\\nto plus or minus 6. Let me just write\\nthat on another line. So x is equal to\\nplus or minus 6. And remember here, if something\\nsquared is equal to 36, that something could\\nbe the negative version or the positive version. It could be the\\nprincipal root or it could be the negative root. Both negative 6 squared is\\n36 and positive 6 squared is 36, so both of these work. And you could put them back\\ninto the original equation to verify it. Let's do that. If you say 2 times\\n6 squared plus 3, that's 2 times 36, which\\nis 72 plus 3 is 75. So that works. If you put negative\\n6 in there, you're going to get the\\nexact same result. Because negative 6\\nsquared is also 36. 2 times 36 is 72 plus 3 is 75. \",\n",
       " '14.3.2': '- [Voiceover] So pause\\nthe video and see if you can solve for x here. Figure out which x-values\\nwill satisfy this equation. All right, let\\'s work through this. So, the way I\\'m gonna do\\nthis is I\\'m gonna isolate the x plus three squared on one side and the best way to do that\\nis to add four to both sides. So, adding four to both sides will get rid of this\\nfour, subtracting four, this negative four on the left-hand side. And so we\\'re just left\\nwith x plus three squared. X plus three squared. And on the right-hand\\nside I\\'m just gonna have zero plus four. So, x plus three squared is equal to four. And so now, I could take the square root of both sides and, or, another\\nway of thinking about it, if I have something-squared equaling four, I could say that that something needs to either be positive or negative two. So, one way of thinking about it is, I\\'m saying that x plus\\nthree is going to be equal to the plus or minus\\nsquare root of that four. And hopefully this makes\\nintuitive sense for you. If something-squared is equal to four, that means that the something, that means that this\\nsomething right over here, is going to be equal to the\\npositive square root of four or the negative square root of four. Or it\\'s gonna be equal to\\npositive or negative two. And so we could write that x plus three could\\nbe equal to positive two or x plus three could be\\nequal to negative two. Notice, if x plus three was positive two, two-squared is equal to four. If x plus three was negative two, negative two-squared is equal to four. So, either of these would\\nsatisfy our equation. So, if x plus three is\\nequal to two, we could just subtract three from both\\nsides to solve for x and we\\'re left with x is\\nequal to negative one. Or, over here we could subtract three from both sides to solve for x. So, or, x is equal to\\nnegative two minus three is negative five. So, those are the two possible solutions and you can verify that. Take these x-values,\\nsubstitute it back in, and then you can see when\\nyou substitute it back in if you substitute x equals negative one, then x plus three is equal to two, two-squared is four, minus four is zero. And when x is equal to negative five, negative five plus three is negative two, squared is positive four, minus\\nfour is also equal to zero. So, these are the two possible x-values that satisfy the equation. Now let\\'s do another one\\nthat\\'s presented to us in a slightly different way. So, we are told that f of x is\\nequal to x minus two squared minus nine. And then we\\'re asked at what x-values does the graph of y equals\\nf of x intersect the x-axis. So, if I\\'m just generally\\ntalking about some graph, so I\\'m not necessarily gonna\\ndraw that y equals f of x. So if I\\'m just, so that\\'s our\\ny-axis, this is our x-axis. And so if I just have the\\ngraph of some function. If I have the graph of some function that looks something like that. Let\\'s say that the y is\\nequal to some other function, not necessarily this f of x. Y is equal to g of x. The x-values where you intersect, where you intersect the x-axis. Well, in order to intersect the x-axis, y must be equal to zero. So, y is equal to zero there. Notice our y-coordinate\\nat either of those points are going to be equal to zero. And that means that our\\nfunction is equal to zero. So, figuring out the\\nx-values where the graph of y equals f of x intersects the x-axis, this is equivalent to saying, \"For what x-values does\\nf of x equal zero?\" So we could just say, \"For what x-values does\\nthis thing right over here \"equal zero?\" So, let me just write that down. So we could rewrite this as x, x minus two squared minus nine equals zero. We could add nine to both\\nsides and so we could get x minus two squared is equal to nine. And just like we saw before, that means that x minus two is equal to the positive or negative square root of nine. So, we could say x minus two\\nis equal to positive three or x minus two is equal to negative three. Well, you add two to both sides of this, you get x is equal to five, or x is equal to, if we\\nadd two to both sides of this equation, you\\'ll get\\nx is equal to negative one. And you can verify that. If x is equal to five,\\nfive minus two is three, squared is nine, minus nine is zero. So, the point five comma zero is going to be on this graph. And also, if x is equal to negative one, negative one minus two, negative three. Squared is positive\\nnine, minus nine is zero. So, also the point negative one comma zero is on this graph. So those are the points where, those are the x-values where the function intersects the x-axis. ',\n",
       " '14.3.3': \"Meredith is solving the\\nfollowing problem for homework, 2 times the quantity x plus\\n4 squared is equal to 242. She completes the problem\\nas seen in the steps below, and they give us the\\nsteps right over here. When she gets to\\nschool the next day, her teacher tells her that\\nthe answer's x equals 7 and x equals negative 15. She only got x equals 7 here. In what step did\\nshe make an error? So this first step\\nright here-- and I encourage you to\\npause this video and try to figure\\nthis out on your own before I work through it. So this first step, let's see. She got rid of this 2 by\\ndividing the left-hand side by 2, and she\\nappropriately divided. Well, you can't just\\ndo that to one side. You have to do\\nthat to both sides in order to hold this equality. So she divided 242 by 2 as\\nwell, so that is correct. Step one makes sense. And then she just\\nwanted-- instead of this being an\\nx plus 4 squared, she wanted it to be an x plus 4. So she attempted to take the\\nsquare root of both sides. She said hey, look. The square root of x plus\\n4 squared is x plus 4, and the square\\nroot of 121 is 11. And this is where she made\\na small but very, very, very, very important mistake. Because if something\\nsquared is equal to 121, that means that\\nsomething could be the positive or negative\\nsquare root of 121. This thing that we're\\nsquaring could be positive 11, because positive\\n11 squared is 121, or x plus 4 right over\\nhere could be negative 11, because negative 11\\nsquared is also 121. So this right over here,\\nthis should say x plus 4 is equal to the positive or\\nnegative square root of 11, and so that's why she missed out\\non one of the solutions right over here. So she messed up in step two. She should have taken\\nthe positive and negative square root. So, we got that right. \",\n",
       " '14.3.4': \"Use the cards below to create\\na list of steps in order that will solve the\\nfollowing equation. 3 times x plus 6\\nsquared is equal to 75. And I encourage you to\\npause this video now and try to figure it out on your own. Figure out which of these\\nsteps and in what order you would do to\\nsolve for x here. So I'm assuming\\nyou've given it a go. So let's try to work\\nthrough it together. And first, let me just\\nrewrite the equation. So we have 3 times the\\nquantity x plus 6 squared is equal to 75. So what I want to do is I want\\nto isolate the x plus 6 squared on the left-hand side. Or another way of\\nthinking about it-- I don't want this\\n3 here anymore. So how would I\\nget rid of that 3? Well, I could divide\\nthe left-hand side by 3. But if I do that to only\\none side of the equation, it won't be equal anymore. These two things in yellow\\nwere equal to each other. If I want the equalities\\nto hold, anything that I do to the\\nleft-hand side, I have to do the right-hand side. So let me divide\\nthat by 3 as well. And so on the\\nleft-hand side, I am left with x plus 6 squared\\nis equal to 75 divided by 3. So 75 divided by 3 is 25. So actually, let me just\\npick out the first one I did. I divided both sides by 3. So that was my first step then. Let me write that\\nin a darker color. So that was my first\\nstep right over there. Now let's think about\\nwhat we're doing. We're saying that something\\nsquared is equal to 25. So this something could be\\nthe positive or negative square root of 25. So we could write\\nthis as x plus 6 is equal to the plus or\\nminus square root of 25. So I'm essentially taking\\nthe positive and negative square root of both sides. So, let's see. This looks like this step. I took the square\\nroot of both sides. That's step number two. And so, let me\\njust rewrite this. This is the same thing as x plus\\n6 is equal to plus or minus 5. And now I want to just have\\nan x on the left-hand side. I want to solve for x. That's the goal\\nfrom the beginning. So I would like to\\nget rid of this 6. Well, the easiest\\nway to do that is to subtract 6 from\\nthe left-hand side. But just like\\nbefore, I can't just do it from one side\\nof an equation. Then the equality\\nwouldn't be true. We're literally\\nsaying that x plus 6 is equal to plus or minus 5. So x plus 6 minus\\n6 is going to be equal to plus or\\nminus 5 minus 6. Or actually, let me\\nwrite it this way. So let me subtract\\n6 from both sides. On the left-hand side,\\nI'm left with an x. And on the right-hand side,\\nI could write it this way. Let me do it in\\nthat green color. I have negative 6\\nplus or minus 5. So what are the\\npossible values of x? Or actually, I keep forgetting. We don't have to actually\\ngive the value for x. We just have to say\\nwhat steps we did. So then, let's see. After we took the square\\nroot of both sides, we then subtracted\\n6 from both sides. So that was step three\\nright over there. Then that got us to essentially\\nthe two possible x's that would satisfy this\\nequation right over here. And just for fun, let's\\nactually solve it all the way. So if we solve it all the way,\\nso x is equal to negative 6 plus 5 is negative 1, or x is\\nequal to negative 6 minus 5 is negative 11. And you could verify\\nthat both of these work. If you put either of them in\\nhere-- if you put negative 1 here, you get negative 1\\nplus 6 squared is 5 squared. If you put negative 11 here,\\nit's negative 11 plus 6 is negative 5 squared. Obviously either plus or minus\\n5 squared is going to be 25. 25 times 3 is 75. So these are our three steps. We divided both sides by 3. Then we took the square\\nroot of both sides. Then we subtracted\\n6 from both sides. And then we were\\nessentially done. So let's input those steps. So the first thing we did,\\nwe divide both sides by 3. That's the first thing we did. And then we took the\\nsquare root of both sides. And then we subtracted\\n6 from both sides. We got it right. \",\n",
       " '14.4.1': '- [Instructor] It might not be obvious when you look at these three equations but they\\'re the exact same equation. They\\'ve just been\\nalgebraically manipulated. They are in different forms. This is the equation and sometimes called standard\\nform for a quadratic. This is the quadratic in factored form. Notice this has been\\nfactored right over here. And this last form is what we\\'re going to\\nfocus on in this video. This is sometimes known as vertex form and we\\'re not gonna focus on how do you get from\\none of these other forms to a vertex form in this video, we\\'ll do that in future videos,\\nbut what we\\'re going to do is appreciate why this\\nis called vertex form. Now to start, let\\'s just remind\\nourselves what a vertex is. As you might remember from other videos, if we have a quadratic,\\nif we\\'re graphing y is equal to some quadratic\\nexpression in terms of x, the graph of that will be a parabola, and it might be an upward opening parabola or a downward opening parabola. This one in particular is going to be an upward opening parabola, and so it might look something like this. It might look something like this right over here. And for an upward opening\\nparabola like this, the vertex is this point right over here. You could view it as this minimum point. You have your x-coordinate of\\nthe vertex right over there and you have your y-coordinate of the vertex right over here. Now the reason why this\\nis called vertex form is it\\'s fairly straightforward\\nto pick out the coordinates of this vertex from this form. How do we do that? Well, to do that, we just have\\nto appreciate the structure that\\'s in this expression. Let me just rewrite it again. We have y is equal to three\\ntimes x plus two squared minus 27. The important thing to realize is that this part of the expression is never going to be negative. No matter what you have\\nhere, if you square it, you\\'re never going to\\nget a negative value. And so this is never going to be negative and we\\'re multiplying it by\\na positive right over here. This whole thing right over here is going to be greater\\nthan or equal to zero. So another way to think about it, it\\'s only going to be\\nadditive to negative 27. So your minimum point for\\nthis curve right over here, for your parabola, is going to happen when this expression is equal to zero, when you\\'re not adding\\nanything to negative 27. And so, when will this equal zero? Well, it\\'s going to be equal to zero when x plus two is going\\nto be equal to zero. So you could just say, if you wanna find the\\nx-coordinate of the vertex, well, for what x value\\ndoes x plus two equal zero? And of course we can\\nsubtract two from both sides and you get x is equal to\\nnegative two, so we know that this x-coordinate right\\nover here is negative two. And then what\\'s the\\ny-coordinate of the vertex? You could just say, \"Hey,\\nwhat is the minimum y \"that this curve takes on?\" Well, when x is equal to negative two, this whole thing is zero and\\ny is equal to negative 27. Y is equal to negative 27, so this right over here is negative 27. And so the coordinates of the vertex here are negative two comma negative 27. And you are able to pick that out just by looking at the\\nquadratic in vertex form. Now let\\'s get a few more\\nexamples under our belt so that we can really get\\ngood at picking out the vertex when a quadratic is\\nwritten in vertex form. So let\\'s say let\\'s pick a scenario where we have a downward opening parabola, where y is equal to, let\\'s\\njust say negative two times x plus five, actually, let me make it x minus five. X minus five squared, and then let\\'s say plus 10. Well here, this is gonna\\nbe downward opening and let\\'s appreciate why that is. So here, this part is still\\nalways going to be non-negative but it\\'s being multiplied\\nby a negative two, so it\\'s actually always\\ngonna be non-positive. So this whole thing right over here is going to be less than or\\nequal to zero for all x\\'s, so it could only take away from the 10. So, where do we hit a maximum point? Well, we hit a maximum point when x minus five is equal to zero, when we\\'re not taking\\nanything away from the 10. And so, x minus five is equal to zero. Well, that of course is going to happen when x is equal to five, and that indeed is the\\nx-coordinate for the vertex. And what\\'s the y-coordinate\\nfor the vertex? Well, if x is equal to five\\nand this thing is zero, you\\'re not gonna be taking\\nanything away from the 10 and so y is going to be equal to 10. And so the vertex here is x equals five, and I\\'m just gonna eyeball it, maybe it\\'s right over here, x equals five. And y is equal to 10. If this is negative 27,\\nthis would be positive 27, 10 would be something like this. I\\'m not using the same\\nscales for the x and y-axis, but there you have it. So it\\'s five comma 10 and our curve is gonna\\nlook something like this. I don\\'t know exactly where\\nit intersects the x-axis but it\\'s going to be a\\ndownward opening parabola. Let\\'s do one more example just so that we get really fluent at identifying the\\nvertex from vertex form. So let\\'s say, I\\'m just gonna make this up, we have y is equal to negative pi times x minus 2.8 squared plus 7.1. What is the vertex of the parabola here? Well, the x-coordinate is\\ngoing to be the x value that makes this equal\\nto zero, which is 2.8. And then if this is equal to zero, then this whole thing is\\ngoing to be equal to zero and y is going to be 7.1. So now, you hopefully appreciate why this is called vertex form. It\\'s quite straightforward\\nto pick out the vertex when you have something\\nwritten in this way. ',\n",
       " '14.4.2': \"We're asked to graph the\\nequation y is equal to negative 2 times x minus\\n2 squared plus 5. So let me get by scratch pad out\\nso we could think about this. So y is equal to negative 2\\ntimes x minus 2 squared plus 5. So one thing, when you see a\\nquadratic or a parabola graph expressed in this way, the\\nthing that might jump out at you is that this term\\nright over here is always going to be\\npositive because it's some quantity squared. Or I should say, it's always\\ngoing to be non-negative. It could be equal to 0. So it's always going to\\nbe some quantity squared. And then we're multiplying\\nit by a negative. So this whole quantity\\nright over here is going to be non positive. It's always going to be\\nless than or equal to 0. So this thing is always\\nless than or equal to 0, the maximum value\\nthat y will take on is when this thing\\nactually does equal 0. So the maximum\\nvalue for y is at 5. The maximum value for y is 5. And when does that happen? Well, y hits 5 when\\nthis whole thing is 0. And when does this\\nthing equal 0? Well, this whole thing equals\\n0 when x minus 2 is equal to 0. And x minus 2 is equal to\\n0 when x is equal to 2. So the point 2 comma\\n5 is the maximum point for this parabola. And it is actually\\ngoing to be the vertex. So if we were to graph this,\\nso the point 2 comma 5. So that's my y-axis. This is my x-axis. So this is 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So this right here is\\nthe point 2 comma 5. This is a maximum point,\\nit's a maximum point for this parabola. And now I want to find two more\\npoints so that I can really determine the parabola. Three points completely\\ndetermine a parabola. So that's 1, the vertex,\\nthat's interesting. Now, what I'd like\\nto do is just get two points that are\\nequidistant from the vertex. And the easiest way to do\\nthat is to maybe figure out what happens when x is equal\\nto 1 and when x is equal to 3. So I could make a table here\\nactually, let me do that. So I care about x being equal\\nto 1, 2, and 3, and what the corresponding y is. We already know that when x is\\nequal to 2, y is equal to 5. 2 comma 5 is our vertex. When x is equal to 1, 1\\nminus 2 is negative 1, squared is just 1. So this thing is going\\nto be negative 2 plus 5, so it's going to be 3. And when x is equal to\\n3, this is 3 minus 2, which is 1 squared is 1 times\\nnegative 2 is negative 2 plus 5 is 3 as well. So we have three points. We have the point 1 comma\\n3, the point 2 comma 5, and the point 3 comma\\n3 for this parabola. So let me go back\\nto the exercise and actually put\\nthose three points in. And so we have the point 1 comma\\n3, we have the point 2 comma 5, and we have the point 3 comma 3. And we have now fully\\ndetermined our parabola. \",\n",
       " '14.4.3': '- [Sal] An object is\\nlaunched from a platform. Its height in meters, x\\nseconds after the launch, is modeled by: h of x is\\nequal to negative five times x minus four squared plus 180. Normally, when they talk\\nabout seconds or time, they usually would use the variable t, but we can roll with x being that. Let\\'s think about what\\'s\\ngoing to happen here. Lemme just visualize it. Lemme draw an h axis for our height. Let me draw an x axis. An x axis. At time x is equal to zero. We\\'re on a platform, so we\\'re already gonna have some height. At time x is equal to zero. I\\'m used to saying time t equals zero, but at time x is equal to zero, we\\'re already gonna have some height \\'cause we\\'re on some platform. And then we\\'re gonna\\nlaunch this projectile. And, it\\'s gonna go in\\nthe shape of a parabola, and it\\'s gonna be a\\ndownward-opening parabola. You might say: \"Sal, how do you know \"it\\'s gonna be a\\ndownward-opening parabola?\" Gonna look something like that. I didn\\'t draw it exactly perfectly, but you get, hopefully, the point. The reason why I knew it was a parabola, in particular a downward-opening parabola, is when you look at what\\'s going on here. This is written in vertex\\nform but it\\'s a quadratic. In vertex form, you have an\\nexpression with x squared, and then you\\'re multiplying by negative five right over here. This tells us that it\\'s\\ngonna be downward-opening. If you were to multiply this out, x minus four squared is gonna be x squared plus something else plus something else, then you\\'re gonna have to multiply all those terms by negative five, your leading term is gonna\\nbe negative five x squared. Once again, it\\'s gonna be\\na downward-opening parabola that looks something like that. So, given this visual\\nintuition that we have, let\\'s see if we can answer\\nsome questions about it. The first one I\\'d like to answer is how high is the platform. How high is the platform? How high is the platform? I encourage you to pause the video, and try to figure that out. What is that value right over there? Well, as you can see, we are at that value\\nat time x equals zero. So to figure out how high is the platform, we essentially just have\\nto evaluate h of zero. That\\'s going to be negative five times negative four squared plus 180. I just substituted x with zero. Negative four squared is 16. Negative five times 16 is negative 80. Plus 180. So this is going to be equal to 100. So the platform is 100 meters tall. Remember, the height is given in meters. Now, the next question I have is, how many seconds after launch\\ndo we hit our maximum height? So our maximum height,\\nif we\\'re talking about a downward-opening parabola,\\nit\\'s going to be our vertex, is going to be our maximum height. And so, the x value of that would tell us how long after takeoff,\\nhow long after, or launch, do we hit the maximum height. Trying to use a color you can see. What is this x value right over here? Once again, pause the video, and see if you can figure it out. We\\'re trying to answer how long after launch is the maximum height. Well, it\\'s going to be the\\nx coordinate of our vertex. How do we figure that out? Well, this quadratic has\\nactually been written already in vertex form, which\\nmakes it sound like it should be relatively easy to figure\\nout the vertex over here. To appreciate that, we\\nhave to see the structure in the expression, is one\\nway to think about it. Let\\'s think about what\\'s going on. You have this 180. And then you this other\\nterm right over here. Anything squared is gonna be nonnegative. So x minus four squared is\\nalways gonna be nonnegative. But then you always multiply\\nthat times a negative five, so this whole thing is\\ngonna be non-positive. So, it will never add to the 180. Your maximum value is when\\nthis term right over here is going to be equal to zero. And when is this term\\ngoing to be equal to zero? In order to make this term equal to zero, then x minus four needs\\nto be equal to zero. The only way to get x minus\\nfour to be equal to zero is if x is equal to four. Just by looking at this, you say: \"Hey, what makes this zero?\" Four. X equals four will make this zero. This is right over there. If I were to write h of\\nfour, this is going to be, this term is gonna go to zero, and you\\'re gonna be left with the 180. There you go, this right over here. The maximum height is 180. It happens four seconds after launch. Now, the last question I\\'ll ask you is, how long after launch do\\nwe get to a height of zero? So, for what x makes our height zero? To do that, we have to solve\\nh of x is equal to zero. Or, we can write h of x as negative five times x minus four squared\\nplus 180 is equal to zero. And, once again, pause the video, and see if you can solve this. Could subtract 180 from both sides. You get negative five\\ntimes x minus four squared, is equal to negative 180. We can divide both sides by negative five. We get x minus four\\nsquared is equal to 36. Scroll down a little bit. Then, we could take the plus\\nand minus square root, I guess you could say. And so, that will give us x minus four could be equal to six. Or, x minus four is equal to negative six. In this first situation,\\nadd four to both sides, you get x is equal to 10. Or, you add four to both sides here, you get x is equal to negative two. Now, we\\'re dealing with time here, so negative two would\\'ve been in the past if it wasn\\'t sitting on the platform and if it was just\\ncontinuing its trajectory, I guess you could say, backwards in time. But that\\'s not the x that we\\nwanna take into consideration. We want the positive time value,\\nand that\\'s right over here. That is when x is equal to 10. 10 seconds after takeoff, our height is going to be equal to zero. If the ground is at height of zero, if it\\'s at sea level, I guess, then, that\\'s when our projectile\\nis going to hit the ground. ',\n",
       " '14.5.1': \"We're asked to solve for s. And we have s squared minus\\n2s minus 35 is equal to 0. Now if this is the first time\\nthat you've seen this type of what's essentially a quadratic\\nequation, you might be tempted to try to solve for s using\\ntraditional algebraic means, but the best way to solve this,\\nespecially when it's explicitly equal to 0, is to\\nfactor the left-hand side, and then think about the fact that\\nthose binomials that you factor into, that they have\\nto be equal to 0. So let's just do that. So how can we factor this? We've seen it in several ways. I'll show you the standard\\nwe've been doing it, by grouping, and then there's a\\nlittle bit of a shortcut when you have a 1 as a coefficient\\nover here. So when you do something by\\ngrouping, when you factor by grouping, you think about two\\nnumbers whose sum is going to be equal to negative 2. So you think about two numbers\\nwhose sum, a plus b, is equal to negative 2 and whose product\\nis going to be equal to negative 35. a times b is equal\\nto negative 35. So if the product is a negative\\nnumber, one has to be positive, one has\\nto be negative. And so if you think about it,\\nones that are about two apart, you have 5 and negative 7,\\nI think that'll work. 5 plus negative 7 is equal\\nto negative 2. So to factor by grouping, you\\nsplit this middle term. We can split this into a--\\nlet me write it this way. We have s squared, and then this\\nmiddle term right here, I'll do it in pink. This middle term right there I\\ncan write it as plus 5s minus 7s and then we have\\nthe minus 35. And then, of course, all\\nof that is equal to 0. Now, we call it factoring by\\ngrouping because we group it. So we can group these first two\\nterms. And these first two terms, they have a common\\nfactor of s. So let's factor that out. You have s times s plus 5. That's the same thing as\\ns squared plus 5s. Now, in these second two terms\\nright here, you have a common factor of negative 7, so\\nlet's factor that out. So you have negative\\n7 times s plus 5. And, of course, all of\\nthat is equal to 0. Now, we have two terms here,\\nwhere both of them have s plus 5 as a factor. So we can factor that out. So let's do that. So you have s plus 5 times\\nthis s right here, right? S plus 5 times s will\\ngive you this term. And then you have minus\\nthat 7 right there. I undistributed the s plus 5. And then this is going\\nto be equal to 0. Now that we've factored it, we\\njust have to think a little bit about what happens\\nwhen you take the product of two numbers? I mean, s plus 5 is a number. s minus 7 is another number. And we're saying that the\\nproduct of those two numbers is equal to zero. If ever told you that I had\\ntwo numbers, if I told you that I had the numbers a times\\nb and that they equal to 0, what do we know about either\\na or b or both of them? Well, at least one of them has\\nto be equal to 0, or both of them have to be equal to 0. So, the fact that this number\\ntimes that number is equal to zero tells us that either s plus\\n5 is equal to 0 or-- and maybe both of them-- s minus\\n7 is equal to 0. I'll do that in just green. And so you have these two\\nequations, and actually, we could say and/or. It could be or/and, either way,\\nand both of them could be equal to 0. So let's see how we can\\nsolve for this. Well, we can just subtract\\n5 from both sides of this equation right there. And so you get, on the left-hand\\nside, you have s is equal to negative 5. That is one solution to the\\nequation, or you can add 7 to both sides of that equation, and\\nyou get s is equal to 7. So if s is equal to negative 5,\\nor s is equal to 7, then we have satisfied this equation. We can even verify it. If you make s equal to negative\\n5, you have positive 25 plus 10, which is minus 35. That does equal zero. If you have 7, 49 minus 14\\nminus 35 does equal zero. So we've solved for s. Now, I mentioned there's\\nan easier way to do it. And when you have something like\\nthis, where you have 1 as the leading coefficient,\\nyou don't have to do this two-step factoring. Let me just show\\nyou an example. If I just have x plus a\\ntimes x plus b, what is that equal to? x times x is x squared,\\nx times b is bx. a times x is plus ax. a times b is ab. So you get x squared plus--\\nthese two can be added-- plus a plus bx plus ab. And that's the pattern that\\nwe have right here. We have 1 as a leading\\ncoefficient here, we have 1 as a leading coefficient here. So once we have our two\\nnumbers that add up to negative 2, that's our a plus\\nb, and we have our product that gets to negative 35, then\\nwe can straight just factor it into the product of\\nthose two things. So it will be-- or the product\\nof the binomials, where those will be the a's and the b's. So we figured it out. It's 5 and negative 7. 5 plus negative 7\\nis negative 2. 5 times negative 7\\nis negative 35. So we could have just straight\\nfactored at this point. 2, well, actually this\\nwas the case of s. So we could have factored it\\nstraight to the case of s plus 5 times s minus 7. We could have done that straight\\naway and would've gotten to that right there. And, of course, that whole\\nthing was equal to zero. So that would've been a little\\nbit of a shortcut, but factoring by grouping is a\\ncompletely appropriate way to do it as well. \",\n",
       " '14.5.2': \"- [Voiceover] We have six\\nx squared, minus 120 x, plus 600, equals zero. Like always, pause this video, and see if you can solve for x, if you could find the x values\\nthat satisfy this equation. Alright, let's work through this together. The numbers here don't seem\\nlike outlandish numbers. They seem like something that\\nI might be able to deal with, and I might be able to factor,\\nso let's try to do that. The first thing I like\\nto do is see if I can get a coefficient of one, on\\nthe second degree term, on the x-squared term. It looks like actually all of these terms are divisible by six. So if we divide both sides\\nof this equation by six, I'm still going to have\\nnice integer coefficients. Let's do that. Let's divide both sides by six. If we divide the left side\\nby six, divide by six, divide by six, divide by six. And I divide the right side by six. If I do that, and clearly\\nif I do the same thing to both sides of the equation, then the equality still holds. On the left-hand side, I am\\ngoing to be left with x squared, and then negative 120, divided by six. That is, let's see. 120 divided by six is 20. So that's minus 20 x. Then 600 divided by six, is 100. So plus 100, is equal\\nto zero divided by six. Is equal to zero. So let's see if we can factor, if we can express this quadratic as a product of two expressions. The way we think about this, and we've done it multiple times, if we have something, if we have x plus a, times x plus b, and this is\\nhopefully review for you. If you multiply that out,\\nthat is going to be equal to, that equals to x squared, plus a, plus b, x, plus a b. What we want to do is\\nsee if we can factor this into an x plus a, and an x plus b. A plus b, needs to be\\nequal to negative 20. That needs to be a plus b. And then a times b, right over here, that needs to be equal\\nto the constant term. That needs to be a times\\nb, right over there. Can we think of two numbers,\\nthat if we take their product, we get positive 100, and\\nif we take their sum, we get negative 20? Well since their product is positive, we know that they have the same sign. They're both going to have the same sign. They're either both going to be positive, or their both going to be negative, since we know that we\\nhave a positive product. Since their sum is negative, well they both must both be negative. You can't add up two positive\\nnumbers, and get a negative. So they both must be negative. Let's think about it a little bit. What negative numbers,\\nwhen I add them together I get negative 20, when\\nI multiply it, I get 100? Well you could try to factor 100. You could say, well negative\\ntwo times negative 50, or negative four times negative 25. But the one that might jump out at you is this is negative 10,\\ntimes, I'll write it this way, negative 10, times negative 10, and this is negative 10, plus negative 10. So in that case, both our a and\\nour b, would be negative 10. And so we can rewrite the\\nleft side of this equation as, we can rewrite it as, x, and I'll write it this way at first, x plus negative 10, times, x plus negative 10 again. X plus negative 10, and that is going to be equal to zero. So all I've done is I've\\nfactored this quadratic. Another way, these are both\\nthe same thing as x minus 10. I could rewrite this\\nas x minus 10, squared, is equal to zero. The only way that the left-hand side is going to be equal to zero, is if x minus 10 is equal to zero. You could think of this as taking the square root of both sides. It doesn't matter if\\nyou're taking the positive or negative square root, or both of them. The square root of zero, is zero. So, we would say, that x minus\\n10 needs to be equal to zero. So x , adding 10 to both sides of this, you have x is equal to 10, is the solution to this quadratic equation, up here. \",\n",
       " '14.5.3': \"- [Voiceover] So let's\\ntry to find the solutions to this equation right over here. We have the quantity two\\nX minus three squared, and that is equal to four X minus six, and I encourage you to pause the video and give it a shot. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint, you could do this in the traditional way of expanding this out, and then turning it into kind\\nof a classic quadratic form, but there might be a faster\\nor a simpler way to do this if you really pay\\nattention to the structure of both sides of this equation. Well let's look at this, we\\nhave two X minus three squared on the left-hand side, on the right-hand side\\nwe have four X minus six. Well four X minus six,\\nthat's just two times two X minus three, let me be clear there, so this is the same thing as two X minus three squared is equal to, four X minus six, if I factor out a two, that's two times two X minus three. And so this is really interesting, we have something squared is equal to two times that something. So if we can solve for the something, let me be very clear here, so the stuff in blue squared is equal to two times the stuff in blue. So if we can solve for what the stuff in blue could be equal to, then we could solve for X, and I'll show you that right now. So let's say, let's just\\nreplace two X minus three, we'll do a little bit of a substitution, let's replace that with P. So let's say that P is equal to two X minus three. Well then this equation\\nsimplifies quite nicely, the left-hand side becomes P squared, P squared is equal to two times P, 'cause once again two X minus three is P, two times P. And now we just have to solve for P. And I'll switch to just one color now. So we can write this as, if we subtract two P from both sides, we can get P squared minus two P is equal to zero, and we can factor out a P, so we get P times P minus two is equal to zero. And we've seen this shown multiple times, if I have the product of two\\nthings and they equal to zero, at least one of them\\nneeds to be equal to zero, so either P is equal to zero, or P minus two is equal to zero. Well if P minus two is equal to zero, then that means P is equal to two. So either P equals zero, or P equals two. Well we're not quite done yet, because we wanted to solve for X, and not for P. But luckily we know that two X minus three is equal to P. So now we could say either two X minus three is going\\nto be equal to this P value, is going to be equal to zero, or two X minus three is going\\nto be equal to this P value, is going to be equal to two. And so this is pretty\\nstraightforward to solve, add three to both sides, you get two X is equal to three. Divide both sides by two, and we get X is equal to 3/2, or over here if we add\\nthree to both sides, we get two X is equal to five. Divide both sides by two, and you get X is equal to 5/2. So these are the possible solutions, and this is pretty neat. This one right over here, you could almost do this in your head, it was nice and simple. Well if you were to expand this out, and then subtract this, it would have been a much more complex set of operations that you would have done. You still would have hopefully\\ngotten to the right answer, but it would have just\\ntaken a lot more steps. But here we could appreciate some patterns that we saw in our equations, and namely, we have\\nthis thing being squared and then we have two\\ntimes that same thing, two times two X minus three. \",\n",
       " '14.5.4': \"The height of a triangle\\nis four inches less than the length of the base. The area of the triangle\\nis 30 inches squared. Find the height and base. Use the formula area\\nequals one half base times height for the\\narea of a triangle. OK. So let's think about\\nit a little bit. We have the-- let me\\ndraw a triangle here. So this is our triangle. And let's say that the\\nlength of this bottom side, that's the base,\\nlet's call that b. And then this is the height. This is the height\\nright over here. And then the area is equal to\\none half base times height. Now in this first\\nsentence they tell us at the height\\nof a triangle is four inch is less than\\nthe length of the base. So the height is equal\\nto the base minus 4. That's what that first\\nsentence tells us. The area of the triangle\\nis 30 inches squared. So if we take one half\\nthe base times the height we'll get 30 inches squared. Or we could say that\\n30 inches squared is equal to one half times\\nthe base, times the height. Now instead of putting\\nan h in for height, we know that the height\\nis the same thing as 4 less than the base. So let's put that in there. 4 less than the base. And then let's see\\nwhat we get here. We get-- let me\\ndo this in yellow. We get 30 is equal to\\none half times-- let's distribute the b-- times\\nb, let me make it clear. So let's do it this way. Times b over 2,\\ntimes b, minus 4. I just multiplied the\\none half times the b. Now let's distribute\\nthe b over 2. So 30 is equal to b\\nsquared over 2, be careful. b over 2 times b is\\njust b squared over 2. And then b over 2, times\\nnegative 4 is negative 2b. Now just to get rid\\nof this fraction here let's multiply both\\nsides of this equation by 2. So let's multiply\\nthat side by 2. And let's multiply\\nthat side by 2. On the left hand\\nside you get 60. On the right hand side\\n2 times b squared over 2 is just b squared. Negative 2b times\\n2 is negative 4b. And now we have\\na quadratic here. And the best way to\\nsolve a quadratic-- we have a second degree\\nterm right here-- is to get all of the terms\\non one side of the equation, having them equal 0. So let's subtract 60 from\\nboth sides of this equation. And we get 0 equal to b\\nsquared, minus 4b, minus 60. And so what we need\\nto do here is just factor this thing right\\nnow, or factor it. And then, no-- if I have\\nthe product of some things, and that equals 0, that\\nmeans that either one or both of those things need\\nto be equal to 0. So we need to factor b\\nsquared, minus 4b, minus 60. So what we want to do, we\\nwant to find two numbers whose sum is negative 4 and\\nwhose product is negative 60. Now, given that the\\nproduct is negative, we know there are\\ndifferent signs. And this tells us that\\ntheir absolute values are going to be four apart. That one is going to be\\nfour less than the others. So you could look at the\\nproducts of the factors of 60. 1 and 60 are too far apart. Even if you made\\none of the negative, you would either get positive\\n59 as the sum or negative 59 as the sum. 2 and 30, still too far apart. 3 and 20, still too far apart. If you had made\\none negative you'd either get negative\\n17 or positive 17. Then you could have 4 and\\n15, still too far apart. If you made one\\nof them negative, their sum would be either\\nnegative 11 or positive 11. Then you have 5 and a 12,\\nstill seems too far apart from each other. One of them is negative,\\nthen you either have their sum being\\npositive 7 or negative 7. Then you have 6 and 10. Now this looks interesting. They are four apart. So if we make-- and we want\\nthe larger absolute magnitude number to be negative so\\nthat their sum is negative. So if we make it\\n6 and negative 10 their sum will be negative\\n4, and their product is negative 60. So that works. So you could literally\\nsay that this is equal to b plus 6, times\\nb, minus 10. b plus the a, plus b minus the b. And let me be very careful here. This b over here, I want\\nto make it very clear, is different than the b that\\nwe're using in the equation. I just used this b\\nhere to say, look, we're looking for two numbers\\nthat add up to this second term right over here. It's a different b. I could have said x plus\\ny is equal to negative 4, and x times y is\\nequal to negative 60. In fact, let me do it that way\\njust so we don't get confused. So we could write x plus\\ny is equal to negative 4. And then we have x times\\ny is equal to negative 60. So we have b plus 6,\\ntimes b plus y. x is 6, y is negative 10. And that is equal to 0. Let's just solve\\nthis right here. And then we'll go\\nback and show you. You could also factor\\nthis by grouping. But just from this, we know\\nthat either one of these is equal to zero. Either b plus 6 is equal to 0,\\nor b minus 10 is equal to 0. If we subtract 6 from both\\nsides of this equation, we get b is equal to negative 6. Or if you add 10 to both\\nsides of this equation, you get b is equal to 10. And those are our two solutions. You could put them\\nback in and verify that they satisfy\\nour constraints. Now the other way that\\nyou could solve this, and we're going to\\nget exact same answer. Is you could just break\\nup this negative 4b into its constituents. So you could have broken this\\nup into 0 is equal to b squared. And then you could have broken\\nit up into plus 6b, minus 10b, minus 60. And then factor it by grouping. Group these first two terms. Group these second two terms. Just going to add them together. The first one you\\ncould factor out a b. So you have b times b, plus 6. The second one you can\\nfactor out a negative 10. So minus 10 times b, plus 6. All that's equal to 0. And now you can\\nfactor out a b plus 6. So if you factor\\nout a b plus 6 here, you get 0 is equal to b\\nminus 10, times b, plus 6. We're literally just factoring\\nout this out of the expression. You're just left\\nwith a b minus 10. You get the same thing that\\nwe did in one step over here. Whatever works for you. But either way,\\nthe solutions are either b is equal to negative\\n6, or b is equal to 10. And we have to be careful here. Remember, this is\\na word problem. We can't just state, oh b could\\nbe negative 6 or b could be 10. We have to think about\\nwhether this makes sense in the context of\\nthe actual problem. We're talking about\\nlengths of triangles, or lengths of the\\nsides of triangles. We can't have a negative length. So because of that,\\nthe base of a triangle can't have length of negative 6. So we can cross that out. So we actually only\\nhave one solution here. Almost made a careless mistake. Forgot that we were dealing\\nwith the word problem. The only possible base is 10. And let's see, they say find\\nthe height and the base. Once again, done. So the base we're saying is 10. The height is four inches less. It's b minus 4. So the height is 6. And then you can verify. The area is 6 times 10\\ntimes one half, which is 30. \",\n",
       " '14.5.5': \"The volume of a box is\\n405 cube units, or I guess cubic units. So they just want to\\nkeep it general. It could've been in cubic feet,\\nor cubic meters, or cubic centimeters,\\nor cubic miles. Who knows? They just want to keep\\nit as units, keep it as general as possible. The length is x units, the width\\nis x plus 4 units, and the height is 9 units. So let me draw this box here. Let me draw a little box here,\\nso we have a nice little visualization. So they tell us, that\\nthe length is x. Maybe we could call this\\nthe length right there. They say the width is x\\nplus 4, and the height is 9 of this box. In units, what are the\\ndimensions of the box? Well, they also tell us that\\nthe volume is 405. So the volume, 405-- let\\nme do it this way. So if we wanted to calculate the\\nvolume, what would it be? Well it would be the width-- it\\nwould be x plus 4 times the length -- times x-- times 9. That's, literally, the\\nvolume of the box. Now they also tell us that the\\nvolume of the box is 405 cubic units, is equal to 405. So now we just solve for x. So what do we get here? If we distribute this x\\ninto this x plus 4. Actually, if we distribute\\na 9x. Let me just rewrite it. This is the same thing\\nas 9x times x plus 4 is equal to 405. 9x times x is equal\\nto 9x squared. 9x times 4 is equal to\\n36x, is equal to 405. Now we want our quadratic\\nexpression to be equal to 0. So let's subtract 405 from both\\nsides of this equation. So when you do that, your\\nright-hand side equals 0, and your left-hand side is 9x\\nsquared plus 36x minus 405. Now, is there any common\\nfactor to these numbers right here? Well 405, 4 plus 0 plus 5 is 9,\\nso that is divisible by 9. So all of these are\\ndivisible by 9. Let's just figure out what\\n405 divided by 9 is. So 9 goes into 405-- 9\\ngoes into 40 4 times. 4 times 9 is 36. Subtract you get 45. 9 goes into 45 5 times. 5 times 9 is 45. Subtract, you get 0. So it goes 45 times. So if we factor out a 9 here,\\nwe get 9 times x squared-- actually even better, you\\ndon't even have to factor out of 9. If you think about it, you can\\ndivide both sides of this equation by 9. So if you can divide all of\\nthe terms by 9, it won't change the equation. You're doing the same thing to\\nboth sides of equations, which we've learned long ago is a\\nvery valid thing to do. So here you get x squared-- if\\nyou just had this expression, here, and someone told you to\\nfactor it, then you'd have to factor out the 9. But because this is an equation,\\nit equals 0, let's just divide everything by 9. It'll simplify things. So you get x squared plus 4x\\nminus 45 is equal to 0. And now we can try to factor\\nthis right here. And this fits the pattern, where\\nwe don't have a leading 1 out here. So we don't even have to\\ndo it by grouping. You just have to think, what 2\\nnumbers, when I take their product I get negative 45, and\\nwhen I take their sum, I get positive 4. They are 4 apart. 1 has to be positive, 1\\nhas to be negative. Their positive versions\\nhave to be 4 apart. Because when you take the sum,\\nyou are really taking their difference because 1 of\\nthem is negative. So let's think about it. When you have positive\\n9 and negative 5, I think that'll work. Right? Positive 9 plus negative\\n5 is 4. And when you take the product,\\nyou get negative 45. So you have x plus 9 times\\nx minus 5 is equal to 0. Just factored it out. And we've seen this before. If you have 2 numbers, when you\\ntake their product that equals 0, that means 1 of these\\nnumbers at least has to be equal 0. So this means that x plus\\n9 is equal to 0. Scroll down a little bit. x plus 9 is equal 0, or\\nx minus 5 is equal 0. So if we subtract 9 from this\\nequation right there, you get x is equal to negative 9, or if\\nyou add 5 to both sides of this equation, here. You get x is equal to 5. So these are both possible\\nvalues of x right here. So the box, if you take x is\\nequal to negative 9, well, x equal to negative\\n9 won't work. Because if you but negative 9\\nhere, you're going to have a box that has a width of negative\\n5, a length of negative 9, and a height of 9. And if we're talking about our\\nreality, we don't have negative distances like this. That can't be the length\\nor the width. So x equals negative 9 isn't\\nappropriate for this problem Because in this problem we\\nneed to have positive dimensions. So let's see what happens\\nwith x equals 5. If x equals 5, x plus 4 is 9,\\nand this dimension right here is going to be 5. And that seems pretty reasonable\\nfor our reality. And let's verify that\\nthis does end up with a volume of 405. 9 times 5 is 45 times\\n9 is indeed 405. We just figured that out over\\nhere, that 45 times 9 is 405. So we're done. \",\n",
       " '14.6.1': \"In this video, I'm going to\\nexpose you to what is maybe one of at least the top five\\nmost useful formulas in mathematics. And if you've seen many of my\\nvideos, you know that I'm not a big fan of memorizing\\nthings. But I will recommend you\\nmemorize it with the caveat that you also remember how to\\nprove it, because I don't want you to just remember\\nthings and not know where they came from. But with that said, let me\\nshow you what I'm talking about: it's the quadratic\\nformula. And as you might guess, it is to\\nsolve for the roots, or the zeroes of quadratic equations. So let's speak in very general\\nterms and I'll show you some examples. So let's say I have an equation\\nof the form ax squared plus bx plus\\nc is equal to 0. You should recognize this. This is a quadratic equation\\nwhere a, b and c are-- Well, a is the coefficient on the x\\nsquared term or the second degree term, b is the\\ncoefficient on the x term and then c, is, you could imagine,\\nthe coefficient on the x to the zero term, or it's\\nthe constant term. Now, given that you have a\\ngeneral quadratic equation like this, the quadratic formula\\ntells us that the solutions to this equation are\\nx is equal to negative b plus or minus the square root of\\nb squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. And I know it seems crazy and\\nconvoluted and hard for you to memorize right now, but as you\\nget a lot more practice you'll see that it actually is a pretty\\nreasonable formula to stick in your brain someplace. And you might say, gee, this is\\na wacky formula, where did it come from? And in the next video I'm\\ngoing to show you where it came from. But I want you to get used to\\nusing it first. But it really just came from completing\\nthe square on this equation right there. If you complete the square here,\\nyou're actually going to get this solution and that\\nis the quadratic formula, right there. So let's apply it to some\\nproblems. Let's start off with something that we could have\\nfactored just to verify that it's giving us the\\nsame answer. So let's say we have x\\nsquared plus 4x minus 21 is equal to 0. So in this situation-- let me\\ndo that in a different color --a is equal to 1, right? The coefficient on the\\nx squared term is 1. b is equal to 4, the coefficient\\non the x-term. And then c is equal\\nto negative 21, the constant term. And let's just plug it in the\\nformula, so what do we get? We get x, this tells us that\\nx is going to be equal to negative b. Negative b is negative 4-- I put\\nthe negative sign in front of that --negative b\\nplus or minus the square root of b squared. b squared is 16, right? 4 squared is 16, minus 4 times\\na, which is 1, times c, which is negative 21. So we can put a 21 out there\\nand that negative sign will cancel out just like that with\\nthat-- Since this is the first time we're doing it, let me\\nnot skip too many steps. So negative 21, just so you\\ncan see how it fit in, and then all of that over 2a. a is 1, so all of that over 2. So what does this simplify, or\\nhopefully it simplifies? So we get x is equal to negative\\n4 plus or minus the square root of-- Let's see we\\nhave a negative times a negative, that's going to\\ngive us a positive. And we had 16 plus, let's see\\nthis is 6, 4 times 1 is 4 times 21 is 84. 16 plus 84 is 100. That's nice. That's a nice perfect square. All of that over 2, and so this\\nis going to be equal to negative 4 plus or\\nminus 10 over 2. We could just divide both of\\nthese terms by 2 right now. So this is equal to negative 4\\ndivided by 2 is negative 2 plus or minus 10 divided\\nby 2 is 5. So that tells us that x could be\\nequal to negative 2 plus 5, which is 3, or x could be equal\\nto negative 2 minus 5, which is negative 7. So the quadratic formula\\nseems to have given us an answer for this. You can verify just by\\nsubstituting back in that these do work, or you could even\\njust try to factor this right here. You say what two numbers when\\nyou take their product, you get negative 21 and when you\\ntake their sum you get positive 4? So you'd get x plus 7\\ntimes x minus 3 is equal to negative 21. Notice 7 times negative 3 is\\nnegative 21, 7 minus 3 is positive 4. You would get x plus-- sorry\\nit's not negative --21 is equal to 0. There should be a 0 there. So you get x plus 7 is equal\\nto 0, or x minus 3 is equal to 0. X could be equal to negative\\n7 or x could be equal to 3. So it definitely gives us the\\nsame answer as factoring, so you might say, hey why bother\\nwith this crazy mess? And the reason we want to bother\\nwith this crazy mess is it'll also work for problems\\nthat are hard to factor. And let's do a couple of\\nthose, let's do some hard-to-factor problems\\nright now. So let's scroll down to get\\nsome fresh real estate. Let's rewrite the formula again,\\njust in case we haven't had it memorized yet. x is going\\nto be equal to negative b plus or minus the square root\\nof b squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. I'll supply this to\\nanother problem. Let's say we have the equation\\n3x squared plus 6x is equal to negative 10. Well, the first thing we want\\nto do is get it in the form where all of our terms or on the\\nleft-hand side, so let's add 10 to both sides\\nof this equation. We get 3x squared plus the\\n6x plus 10 is equal to 0. And now we can use a\\nquadratic formula. So let's apply it here. So a is equal to 3. That is a, this is b and\\nthis right here is c. So the quadratic formula\\ntells us the solutions to this equation. The roots of this quadratic\\nfunction, I guess we could call it. x is going to be equal\\nto negative b. b is 6, so negative 6\\nplus or minus the square root of b squared. b is 6, so we get 6 squared\\nminus 4 times a, which is 3 times c, which is 10. Let's stretch out the radical\\nlittle bit, all of that over 2 times a, 2 times 3. So we get x is equal to negative\\n6 plus or minus the square root of 36 minus-- this\\nis interesting --minus 4 times 3 times 10. So this is minus-- 4\\ntimes 3 times 10. So this is minus 120. All of that over 6. So this is interesting, you\\nmight already realize why it's interesting. What is this going\\nto simplify to? 36 minus 120 is what? That's 84. We make this into a 10,\\nthis will become an 11, this is a 4. It is 84, so this is going to be\\nequal to negative 6 plus or minus the square root of-- But\\nnot positive 84, that's if it's 120 minus 36. We have 36 minus 120. It's going to be negative\\n84 all of that 6. So you might say, gee,\\nthis is crazy. What a this silly quadratic\\nformula you're introducing me to, Sal? It's worthless. It just gives me a square root\\nof a negative number. It's not giving me an answer. And the reason why it's not\\ngiving you an answer, at least an answer that you might want,\\nis because this will have no real solutions. In the future, we're going to\\nintroduce something called an imaginary number, which is a\\nsquare root of a negative number, and then we can actually\\nexpress this in terms of those numbers. So this actually does have\\nsolutions, but they involve imaginary numbers. So this actually has no real\\nsolutions, we're taking the square root of a negative\\nnumber. So the b squared with the b\\nsquared minus 4ac, if this term right here is negative,\\nthen you're not going to have any real solutions. And let's verify that\\nfor ourselves. Let's get our graphic calculator\\nout and let's graph this equation right here. So, let's get the graphs that y\\nis equal to-- that's what I had there before --3x squared\\nplus 6x plus 10. So that's the equation and we're\\ngoing to see where it intersects the x-axis. Where does it equal 0? So let me graph it. Notice, this thing just comes\\ndown and then goes back up. Its vertex is sitting here\\nabove the x-axis and it's upward-opening. It never intersects\\nthe x-axis. So at no point will this\\nexpression, will this function, equal 0. At no point will y equal\\n0 on this graph. So once again, the quadratic\\nformula seems to be working. Let's do one more example,\\nyou can never see enough examples here. And I want to do ones that are,\\nyou know, maybe not so obvious to factor. So let's say we get negative 3x\\nsquared plus 12x plus 1 is equal to 0. Now let's try to do it just\\nhaving the quadratic formula in our brain. So the x's that satisfy this\\nequation are going to be negative b. This is b So negative b is\\nnegative 12 plus or minus the square root of b squared, of\\n144, that's b squared minus 4 times a, which is negative 3\\ntimes c, which is 1, all of that over 2 times a, over\\n2 times negative 3. So all of that over negative 6,\\nthis is going to be equal to negative 12 plus or\\nminus the square root of-- What is this? It's a negative times a negative\\nso they cancel out. So I have 144 plus 12, so\\nthat is 156, right? 144 plus 12, all of that\\nover negative 6. Now, I suspect we can\\nsimplify this 156. We could maybe bring\\nsome things out of the radical sign. So let's attempt to do that. So let's do a prime\\nfactorization of 156. Sometimes, this is the hardest\\npart, simplifying the radical. So 156 is the same thing\\nas 2 times 78. 78 is the same thing\\nas 2 times what? That's 2 times 39. So the square root of 156 is\\nequal to the square root of 2 times 2 times 39 or we could say\\nthat's the square root of 2 times 2 times the\\nsquare root of 39. And this, obviously, is just\\ngoing to be the square root of 4 or this is the square root\\nof 2 times 2 is just 2. 2 square roots of 39, if I\\ndid that properly, let's see, 4 times 39. Yeah, it looks like\\nit's right. So this up here will simplify to\\nnegative 12 plus or minus 2 times the square root of 39, all\\nof that over negative 6. Now we can divide the numerator\\nand the denominator maybe by 2. So this will be equal to\\nnegative 6 plus or minus the square root of 39\\nover negative 3. Or we could separate these\\ntwo terms out. We could say this is equal to\\nnegative 6 over negative 3 plus or minus the square root\\nof 39 over negative 3. Now, this is just a 2\\nright here, right? These cancel out, 6 divided\\nby 3 is 2, so we get 2. And now notice, if this is plus\\nand we use this minus sign, the plus will become\\nnegative and the negative will become positive. But it still doesn't\\nmatter, right? We could say minus or plus,\\nthat's the same thing as plus or minus the square root\\nof 39 nine over 3. I think that's about as simple\\nas we can get this answered. I want to make a very clear\\npoint of what I did that last step. I did not forget about\\nthis negative sign. I just said it doesn't matter. It's going to turn the positive\\ninto the negative; it's going to turn the negative\\ninto the positive. Let me rewrite this. So this right here can be\\nrewritten as 2 plus the square root of 39 over negative 3 or 2\\nminus the square root of 39 over negative 3, right? That's what the plus or minus\\nmeans, it could be this or that or both of them, really. Now in this situation, this\\nnegative 3 will turn into 2 minus the square root\\nof 39 over 3, right? I'm just taking this\\nnegative out. Here the negative and the\\nnegative will become a positive, and you get 2\\nplus the square root of 39 over 3, right? A negative times a negative\\nis a positive. So once again, you have\\n2 plus or minus the square of 39 over 3. 2 plus or minus the square\\nroot of 39 over 3 are solutions to this equation\\nright there. Let verify. I'm just curious what the\\ngraph looks like. So let's just look at it. Let me clear this. Where is the clear button? So we have negative 3 three\\nsquared plus 12x plus 1 and let's graph it. Let's see where it intersects\\nthe x-axis. It goes up there and then\\nback down again. So 2 plus or minus the square,\\nyou see-- The square root of 39 is going to be a little\\nbit more than 6, right? Because 36 is 6 squared. So it's going be a little bit\\nmore than 6, so this is going to be a little bit\\nmore than 2. A little bit more than 6 divided\\nby 2 is a little bit more than 2. So you're going to get one value\\nthat's a little bit more than 4 and then another value\\nthat should be a little bit less than 1. And that looks like the case,\\nyou have 1, 2, 3, 4. You have a value that's pretty\\nclose to 4, and then you have another value that is a little\\nbit-- It looks close to 0 but maybe a little bit\\nless than that. So anyway, hopefully you found\\nthis application of the quadratic formula helpful. \",\n",
       " '14.6.2': \"Use the quadratic formula to\\nsolve the equation, negative x squared plus 8x is equal to 1. Now, in order to really use the\\nquadratic equation, or to figure out what our a's, b's and\\nc's are, we have to have our equation in the form, ax\\nsquared plus bx plus c is equal to 0. And then, if we know our a's,\\nb's, and c's, we will say that the solutions to this equation\\nare x is equal to negative b plus or minus the square root\\nof b squared minus 4ac-- all of that over 2a. So the first thing we have to\\ndo for this equation right here is to put it\\nin this form. And on one side of this\\nequation, we have a negative x squared plus 8x, so that looks\\nlike the first two terms. But our constant is on\\nthe other side. So let's get the constant on the\\nleft hand side and get a 0 here on the right hand side. So let's subtract 1 from both\\nsides of this equation. The left hand side of the\\nequation will become negative x squared plus 8x minus 1. And then the right hand\\nside, 1 minus 1 is 0. Now we have it in that form. We have ax squared\\na is negative 1. So let me write this down.\\na is equal to negative 1. a is equal to negative 1. It's implicit there, you could\\nput a 1 here if you like. A negative 1. Negative x squared is the same\\nthing as negative 1x squared. b is equal to 8. So b is equal to 8, that's\\nthe 8 right there. And c is equal to negative 1. That's the negative\\n1 right there. So now we can just apply\\nthe quadratic formula. The solutions to this equation\\nare x is equal to negative b. Plus or minus the square root\\nof b squared, of 8 squared, minus 4ac-- let me do it in that\\ngreen color --minus 4, the green is the part\\nof the formula. The colored parts are the things\\nthat we're substituting into the formula. Minus 4 times a, which is\\nnegative 1, times negative 1, times c, which is\\nalso negative 1. And then all of that-- let me\\nextend the square root sign a little bit further --all\\nof that is going to be over 2 times a. In this case a is negative 1. So let's simplify this. So this becomes negative 8, this\\nis negative 8, plus or minus the square root\\nof 8 squared is 64. And then you have a negative 1\\ntimes a negative 1, these just cancel out just to be a 1. So it's 64 minus is 4. That's just that 4 over there. All of that over negative 2. So this is equal to negative\\n8 plus or minus the square root of 60. All of that over negative 2. And let's see if we can\\nsimplify the radical expression here, the\\nsquare root of 60. Let's see, 60 is equal\\nto 2 times 30. 30 is equal to 2 times 15. And then 15 is 3 times 5. So we do have a perfect\\nsquare here. We do have a 2 times\\n2 in there. It is 2 times 2 times\\n15, or 4 times 15. So we could write, the square\\nroot of 60 is equal to the square root of 4 times the\\nsquare root of 15, right? The square root of 4 times\\nthe square root of 15, that's what 60 is. 4 times 15. And so this is equal to-- square\\nroot of 4 is 2 times the square of 15. So we can rewrite this\\nexpression, right here, as being equal to negative 8 plus\\nor minus 2 times the square root of 15, all of that\\nover negative 2. Now both of these terms right\\nhere are divisible by either 2 or negative 2. So let's divide it. So we have negative 8 divided\\nby negative 2, which is positive 4. So let me write it over here. Negative 8 divided by negative\\n2 is positive 4. And then you have this\\nweird thing. Plus or minus 2 divided\\nby negative 2. And really what we have\\nhere is 2 expressions. But if we're plus 2 and we\\ndivide by negative 2, it will be negative 1. And if we take negative 2 and\\ndivide by negative 2, we're going to have positive 1. So instead of plus or minus, you\\ncould imagine it is going to be minus or plus. But it's really the same thing. Right? It's really now minus or plus. If it was plus, it's now\\ngoing to be a minus. If it was a minus, it's now\\ngoing to be a plus. Minus or plus 2 times the\\nsquare root of 15. Or another way to view it is\\nthat the two solutions here are 4 minus two roots of 15,\\nand 4 plus two roots of 15. These are both values of x\\nthat'll satisfy this equation. And if this confuses you, what I\\ndid, turning a plus or minus into minus plus. Let me just take a little\\nbit of an aside there. I could write this expression\\nup here as two expressions. That's what the plus\\nor minus really is. There's a negative 8 plus 2\\nroots of 15 over negative 2. And then there's a negative\\n8 minus 2 roots of 15 over negative 2. This one simplifies to--\\nnegative 8 divided by negative 2 is 4. 2 divided by negative\\n2 is negative 1. 2 times a 4 minus the\\nsquare root of 15. And then over here you have\\nnegative 8 divided by negative 2, which is 4. And then negative 2 divided by\\nnegative 2, which is plus the square of 15. And I just realized I made\\na mistake up here. When we're dividing a 2 divided\\nby negative 2, we don't have this 2 over here. This is just a plus or\\nminus the root of 15. We just saw that when\\nI did it out here. So this is minus the\\nsquare root of 15. And this is plus the\\nsquare root of 15. So the two solutions for this\\nequation-- It's good that I took that little hiatus there,\\nthat little aside there. The two solutions could be 4\\nminus the square root of 15, or x, or and, x could be 4 plus\\nthe square root of 15. Either of those values of x\\nwill satisfy this original quadratic equation. \",\n",
       " '14.6.3': \"We're asked to solve\\nthe quadratic equation, negative 3x squared plus\\n10x minus 3 is equal to 0. And it's already written\\nin standard form. And there's many\\nways to solve this. But in particular, all solve\\nit using the quadratic formula. So let me just rewrite it. We have negative 3x squared\\nplus 10x minus 3 is equal to 0. And actually, I'll\\nsolve it twice using the quadratic\\nformula to show you that as long as we manipulated\\nthis in the valid way, the quadratic\\nformula will give us the exact same roots or\\nthe exact same solutions to this equation. So in this form right over\\nhere, what are our ABCs? Let's just remind ourselves\\nwhat the quadratic formula even is actually. That's a good place to start. The quadratic formula\\ntells us that if we have a quadratic\\nequation in the form ax squared plus bx plus c is equal\\nto 0, so in standard form, then the roots of this are\\nx are equal to negative b plus or minus the\\nsquare root of b squared minus 4ac,\\nall of that over 2a. And this is derived from\\ncompleting the square in a general way. So it's no magic here, and I've\\nderived it in other videos. But this is the\\nquadratic formula. This is actually giving\\nyou two solutions, because you have the\\npositive square root here and the negative square root. So let's apply it here in the\\ncase where-- in this case, a is equal to negative\\n3, b is equal to 10, and c is equal to negative 3. So applying the quadratic\\nformula right here, we get our solutions to be\\nx is equal to negative b. b is 10. So negative b is negative 10\\nplus or minus the square root of b squared. b is 10. So b squared is 100\\nminus 4 times a times c. So minus 4 times negative\\n3 times negative 3. Let me just write it down. Minus 4 times negative\\n3 times negative 3. All of that's under\\nthe radical sign. And then all of that is over 2a. So 2 times a is negative 6. So this is going to be\\nequal to negative 10 plus or minus the square root\\nof 100 minus-- negative 3 times negative 3 is positive 9. Positive 9 times\\n4 is positive 36. We have a minus sign out here. So minus 36. All of that over negative 6. This is equal to\\n100 minus 36 is 64. So negative 10 plus or\\nminus the square root of 64. All of that over negative 6. The principal square\\nroot of 64 is 8. But we're taking the positive\\nand negative square root. So this is negative 10 plus\\nor minus 8 over negative 6. So if we take the\\npositive version, we say x could be\\nequal to-- negative 10 plus 8 is negative\\n2 over negative 6. So that was taking\\nthe plus version. That's this right over here. And negative 2 over\\nnegative 6 is equal to 1/3. If we take the\\nnegative square root, negative 10 minus 8-- So let's\\ntake negative 10 minus 8. That would be x is equal\\nto-- negative 10 minus 8 is negative 18. And that's going to\\nbe over negative 6. Negative 18 divided by\\nnegative 6 is positive 3. So the two roots for\\nthis quadratic equation are positive 1/3 and positive 3. And I want to show you the\\nwe'll get the same answer, even if we manipulate this. Some people might\\nnot like the fact that our first coefficient\\nhere is a negative 3. Maybe they want a positive 3. So to get rid of\\nthat negative 3, they can multiply both sides of\\nthis equation times negative 1. And then if you did\\nthat, you would get 3x squared minus 10x plus 3 is\\nequal to 0 times negative 1, which is still equal to 0. So in this case, a is equal to\\n3, b is equal to negative 10, and c is equal to 3 again. And we could apply\\nthe quadratic formula. We get x is equal to\\nnegative b. b is negative 10. So negative negative\\n10 is positive 10, plus or minus\\nthe square root of b squared, which is\\nnegative 10 squared, which is 100, minus\\n4 times a times c. a times c is 9 times 4 is 36. So minus 36. All of that over 2 times a. All of that over 6. So this is equal to 10 plus or\\nminus the square root of 64, or really that's\\njust going to be 8. All of that over 6. If we add 8 here, we get\\n10 plus 8 is 18 over 6. We get x could be equal to 3. Or if we take the negative\\nsquare root or the negative 8 here, 10 minus 8 is 2. 2 over 6 is 1/3. So once again, you get\\nthe exact same solutions. \",\n",
       " '14.6.4': \"Determine the number of\\nsolutions to the quadratic equation, x squared plus 14x\\nplus 49 is equal to 0. There's a bunch of ways\\nwe could do it. We could factor it and just\\nfigure out the values of x that satisfy it and\\njust count them. That will be the number\\nof solutions. We could just apply the\\nquadratic formula. But what I want to do here is\\nactually explore the quadratic formula, and think about how we\\ncan determine the number of solutions without even maybe\\nnecessarily finding them explicitly. So the quadratic formula tells\\nus that if we have an equation of the form ax squared plus bx\\nplus c is equal to 0, that the solutions are going to be-- or\\nthe solution if it exists is going to be-- negative b plus or\\nminus the square root of b squared minus 4ac. All of that over 2a. Now the reason why this can be\\n2 solutions is that we have a plus or minus here. If this b squared minus 4ac is\\na positive number-- so let's think about this a little bit. If b squared minus 4ac\\nis greater than 0, what's going to happen? Well, then it's a\\npositive number. It's going to have\\na square root. And then when you add it to\\nnegative b you're going to get one value for the numerator, and\\nwhen you subtract it from negative b you are going\\nto get another value in the numerator. So this is going to lead\\nto two solutions. Now what happens if b squared\\nminus 4ac is equal to 0? If this expression under the\\nradical is equal to 0, you're just going to have the\\nsquare root of 0. So it's going to be negative\\nb plus or minus 0. And it doesn't matter whether\\nyou add or subtract 0, you're going to get the same value. So in that situation, the\\nactual solution of the equation is going to be\\nnegative b over 2a. There's not going to be this\\nplus or minus, it's not going to be relevant. You're only going to\\nhave one solution. So if b squared minus 4ac\\nis equal to 0, you only have one solution. And then what happens if\\nb squared minus 4ac is less than 0? Well if b squared minus 4ac is\\nless than 0, this is going to be a negative number right here\\nand you're going to have to take the square root\\nof a negative number. And we know, from dealing with\\nreal numbers, you can't take the square root. There is no real number\\nsquared that becomes a negative number. So in this situation there is\\nno solutions, or no real-- when I say real I literally\\nmean a real number-- no real solution. So let's think about it\\nin the context of this equation right here. And just in case you're curious\\nif whether this expression right here,\\nb squared minus 4ac, has a name, it does. It's called the discriminant. This is the discriminant. That's that part of the\\nquadratic equation. It determines the number\\nof solutions we have. So if we want to figure out the\\nnumber of solutions for this equation, we don't have\\nto go through the whole quadratic equation, although\\nit's not that much work. We just have to evaluate\\nb squared minus 4ac. So what is b squared\\nminus 4ac? So b is right here, it's 14. So it's 14 squared minus 4 times\\na, which is 1, times c, which is 49. That c, right there, times 49. What's 14 times 14? Let me do it over here. 14 times 14. 4 times 4 is 16. 4 times 1 is 4. Plus 1 is 56. Put a 0. 1 times 14 is 14. It is 6, 9, 1. It's 196. So this right here is 196. And we can ignore the 1. What's 4 times 49? So 49 times 4. 4 times 9 is 36. 4 times 4 is 16 plus\\n3 is 190-- or is 19, so you get 196. So this right here is 196. So b squared minus 4ac\\nis 196 minus 196. So 196 minus 196\\nis equal to 0. So we're dealing with a\\nsituation where the discriminant is equal to 0. We only have one solution. And if you want, you could try\\nto find that one solution. This whole part is going to\\nbe the square root of 0. It's just going to be 0. So the solution is going to\\nbe negative b over 2a. And negative b is-- we\\ncould just solve it. Negative b is negative 14 over 2\\ntimes a. a is just 1 over 2. So it's equal to negative 7. That's the only solution\\nto this equation. But if you just wanted to know\\nhow many solutions, you just have to find out that b squared\\nminus 4ac is 0. So it's only going to\\nhave one solution. And there's other ways. You could have actually factored\\nthis pretty easily into x plus 7 times x plus 7\\nand gotten the same result. \",\n",
       " '14.7.1': \"In this video, I'm going to show\\nyou a technique called completing the square. And what's neat about this is\\nthat this will work for any quadratic equation, and it's\\nactually the basis for the quadratic formula. And in the next video or the\\nvideo after that I'll prove the quadratic formula using\\ncompleting the square. But before we do that, we\\nneed to understand even what it's all about. And it really just builds off\\nof what we did in the last video, where we solved\\nquadratics using perfect squares. So let's say I have the\\nquadratic equation x squared minus 4x is equal to 5. And I put this big space\\nhere for a reason. In the last video, we saw\\nthat these can be pretty straightforward to solve if\\nthe left-hand side is a perfect square. You see, completing the square\\nis all about making the quadratic equation into a\\nperfect square, engineering it, adding and subtracting from\\nboth sides so it becomes a perfect square. So how can we do that? Well, in order for this\\nleft-hand side to be a perfect square, there has to be\\nsome number here. There has to be some number here\\nthat if I have my number squared I get that number, and\\nthen if I have two times my number I get negative 4. Remember that, and I\\nthink it'll become clear with a few examples. I want x squared minus 4x plus\\nsomething to be equal to x minus a squared. We don't know what a\\nis just yet, but we know a couple of things. When I square things-- so this\\nis going to be x squared minus 2a plus a squared. So if you look at this pattern\\nright here, that has to be-- sorry, x squared minus 2ax--\\nthis right here has to be 2ax. And this right here would\\nhave to be a squared. So this number, a is going to\\nbe half of negative 4, a has to be negative 2, right? Because 2 times a is going\\nto be negative 4. a is negative 2, and if a is\\nnegative 2, what is a squared? Well, then a squared is going\\nto be positive 4. And this might look all\\ncomplicated to you right now, but I'm showing you\\nthe rationale. You literally just look at this\\ncoefficient right here, and you say, OK, well what's\\nhalf of that coefficient? Well, half of that coefficient\\nis negative 2. So we could say a is equal to\\nnegative 2-- same idea there-- and then you square it. You square a, you\\nget positive 4. So we add positive 4 here. Add a 4. Now, from the very first\\nequation we ever did, you should know that you can never\\ndo something to just one side of the equation. You can't add 4 to just one\\nside of the equation. If x squared minus 4x was equal\\nto 5, then when I add 4 it's not going to be\\nequal to 5 anymore. It's going to be equal\\nto 5 plus 4. We added 4 on the left-hand side\\nbecause we wanted this to be a perfect square. But if you add something to the\\nleft-hand side, you've got to add it to the right-hand\\nside. And now, we've gotten ourselves\\nto a problem that's just like the problems we\\ndid in the last video. What is this left-hand side? Let me rewrite the\\nwhole thing. We have x squared minus 4x\\nplus 4 is equal to 9 now. All we did is add 4 to both\\nsides of the equation. But we added 4 on purpose so\\nthat this left-hand side becomes a perfect square. Now what is this? What number when I multiply it\\nby itself is equal to 4 and when I add it to itself I'm\\nequal to negative 2? Well, we already answered\\nthat question. It's negative 2. So we get x minus 2 times\\nx minus 2 is equal to 9. Or we could have skipped this\\nstep and written x minus 2 squared is equal to 9. And then you take the square\\nroot of both sides, you get x minus 2 is equal to\\nplus or minus 3. Add 2 to both sides, you get x\\nis equal to 2 plus or minus 3. That tells us that x could be\\nequal to 2 plus 3, which is 5. Or x could be equal to 2 minus\\n3, which is negative 1. And we are done. Now I want to be very clear. You could have done this without\\ncompleting the square. We could've started off\\nwith x squared minus 4x is equal to 5. We could have subtracted 5 from\\nboth sides and gotten x squared minus 4x minus\\n5 is equal to 0. And you could say, hey, if I\\nhave a negative 5 times a positive 1, then their product\\nis negative 5 and their sum is negative 4. So I could say this is x\\nminus 5 times x plus 1 is equal to 0. And then we would say that x is\\nequal to 5 or x is equal to negative 1. And in this case, this actually\\nprobably would have been a faster way to\\ndo the problem. But the neat thing about the\\ncompleting the square is it will always work. It'll always work no matter what\\nthe coefficients are or no matter how crazy\\nthe problem is. And let me prove it to you. Let's do one that traditionally\\nwould have been a pretty painful problem if\\nwe just tried to do it by factoring, especially if we\\ndid it using grouping or something like that. Let's say we had 10x squared\\nminus 30x minus 8 is equal to 0. Now, right from the get-go, you\\ncould say, hey look, we could maybe divide\\nboth sides by 2. That does simplify\\na little bit. Let's divide both sides by 2. So if you divide everything\\nby 2, what do you get? We get 5x squared minus 15x\\nminus 4 is equal to 0. But once again, now we have this\\ncrazy 5 in front of this coefficent and we would have to\\nsolve it by grouping which is a reasonably painful\\nprocess. But we can now go straight to\\ncompleting the square, and to do that I'm now going to divide\\nby 5 to get a 1 leading coefficient here. And you're going to see why this\\nis different than what we've traditionally done. So if I divide this whole thing\\nby 5, I could have just divided by 10 from the get-go\\nbut I wanted to go to this the step first just to show\\nyou that this really didn't give us much. Let's divide everything by 5. So if you divide everything by\\n5, you get x squared minus 3x minus 4/5 is equal to 0. So, you might say, hey, why did\\nwe ever do that factoring by grouping? If we can just always divide by\\nthis leading coefficient, we can get rid of that. We can always turn this into a 1\\nor a negative 1 if we divide by the right number. But notice, by doing that we\\ngot this crazy 4/5 here. So this is super hard to do\\njust using factoring. You'd have to say, what two\\nnumbers when I take the product is equal to\\nnegative 4/5? It's a fraction and when I take\\ntheir sum, is equal to negative 3? This is a hard problem\\nwith factoring. This is hard using factoring. So, the best thing to do is to\\nuse completing the square. So let's think a little bit\\nabout how we can turn this into a perfect square. What I like to do-- and you'll\\nsee this done some ways and I'll show you both ways because\\nyou'll see teachers do it both ways-- I like to get\\nthe 4/5 on the other side. So let's add 4/5 to both\\nsides of this equation. You don't have to do it this\\nway, but I like to get the 4/5 out of the way. And then what do we get\\nif we add 4/5 to both sides of this equation? The left-hand hand side of the\\nequation just becomes x squared minus 3x,\\nno 4/5 there. I'm going to leave a little\\nbit of space. And that's going to\\nbe equal to 4/5. Now, just like the last problem,\\nwe want to turn this left-hand side into the perfect\\nsquare of a binomial. How do we do that? Well, we say, well, what number\\ntimes 2 is equal to negative 3? So some number times\\n2 is negative 3. Or we essentially just take\\nnegative 3 and divide it by 2, which is negative 3/2. And then we square\\nnegative 3/2. So in the example, we'll\\nsay a is negative 3/2. And if we square negative\\n3/2, what do we get? We get positive 9/4. I just took half of this\\ncoefficient, squared it, got positive 9/4. The whole purpose of doing that\\nis to turn this left-hand side into a perfect square. Now, anything you do to one side\\nof the equation, you've got to do to the other side. So we added a 9/4 here, let's\\nadd a 9/4 over there. And what does our\\nequation become? We get x squared minus 3x plus\\n9/4 is equal to-- let's see if we can get a common\\ndenominator. So, 4/5 is the same\\nthing as 16/20. Just multiply the numerator\\nand denominator by 4. Plus over 20. 9/4 is the same thing\\nif you multiply the numerator by 5 as 45/20. And so what is 16 plus 45? You see, this is kind of getting\\nkind of hairy, but that's the fun, I guess, of completing the square sometimes. 16 plus 45. See that's 55, 61. So this is equal to 61/20. So let me just rewrite it. x squared minus 3x plus\\n9/4 is equal to 61/20. Crazy number. Now this, at least on\\nthe left hand side, is a perfect square. This is the same thing as\\nx minus 3/2 squared. And it was by design. Negative 3/2 times negative\\n3/2 is positive 9/4. Negative 3/2 plus negative 3/2\\nis equal to negative 3. So this squared is\\nequal to 61/20. We can take the square root of\\nboth sides and we get x minus 3/2 is equal to the positive\\nor the negative square root of 61/20. And now, we can add 3/2 to both\\nsides of this equation and you get x is equal to\\npositive 3/2 plus or minus the square root of 61/20. And this is a crazy number and\\nit's hopefully obvious you would not have been able to-- at\\nleast I would not have been able to-- get to this number\\njust by factoring. And if you want their actual\\nvalues, you can get your calculator out. And then let me clear\\nall of this. And 3/2-- let's do the plus\\nversion first. So we want to do 3 divided by 2 plus the\\nsecond square root. We want to pick that little\\nyellow square root. So the square root of 61 divided\\nby 20, which is 3.24. This crazy 3.2464, I'll\\njust write 3.246. So this is approximately equal\\nto 3.246, and that was just the positive version. Let's do the subtraction\\nversion. So we can actually put our\\nentry-- if you do second and then entry, that we want that\\nlittle yellow entry, that's why I pressed the\\nsecond button. So I press enter, it puts in\\nwhat we just put, we can just change the positive or the\\naddition to a subtraction and you get negative 0.246. So you get negative 0.246. And you can actually verify\\nthat these satisfy our original equation. Our original equation\\nwas up here. Let me just verify\\nfor one of them. So the second answer on your\\ngraphing calculator is the last answer you use. So if you use a variable answer,\\nthat's this number right here. So if I have my answer squared--\\nI'm using answer represents negative 0.24. Answer squared minus 3 times\\nanswer minus 4/5-- 4 divided by 5-- it equals--. And this just a little\\nbit of explanation. This doesn't store the entire\\nnumber, it goes up to some level of precision. It stores some number\\nof digits. So when it calculated it using\\nthis stored number right here, it got 1 times 10 to\\nthe negative 14. So that is 0.0000. So that's 13 zeroes\\nand then a 1. A decimal, then 13\\nzeroes and a 1. So this is pretty much 0. Or actually, if you got the\\nexact answer right here, if you went through an infinite\\nlevel of precision here, or maybe if you kept it in this\\nradical form, you would get that it is indeed equal to 0. So hopefully you found that\\nhelpful, this whole notion of completing the square. Now we're going to extend it\\nto the actual quadratic formula that we can use, we\\ncan essentially just plug things into to solve any\\nquadratic equation. \",\n",
       " '14.7.2': \"Use completing the square to\\nfind the value of c that makes x squared minus 44x plus c--\\nso we can just figure out a c-- that makes it a perfect\\nsquare trinomial-- and a trinomial is just a polynomial\\nwith three terms here. Then write the expression as\\nthe square of a binomial. So we have x squared\\nminus 44x plus c. So how do we make this into\\na perfect square? Well, if you just look at the\\ntraditional pattern for a perfect square, let's\\njust think of it in terms of x plus a squared. That's the same thing as x plus\\na times x plus a, and we've seen this before. And if you were to multiply this\\nout, that's x times x, which is x squared, plus\\nx times a, which is ax. Plus a times x, which is ax. Plus a times a, which\\nis a squared. So it's x squared plus 2ax,\\nthese two, you have an ax plus an ax gives you 2ax,\\nplus a squared. So if we can get this into this\\npattern, where I have whatever value is here, if\\nI take half of it, right? This is going to be 2a here. If I take half of it and square\\nit over here, then this will be a perfect square. So if we look over here, this\\nthing right here is 2a, if we want to pattern match, if we\\nwant to make this look like a perfect square. That has to be 2a. So negative 44 is equal to 2a. And this, right here, this c, if\\nwe pattern match, c has to be equal to a squared. So what's a? Well, if we know negative 44\\nis 2a, we can divide both sides of that by 2. And we know that negative 22\\nhas got to be equal to a. a has got to be equal\\nto negative 22. a is half of the coefficient\\nright here. It's half of negative 44. And whenever you complete the\\nsquare, it's always going to be half of the coefficient\\nright here. Now, if that's a, what\\ndoes c need to be? Well, c needs to be a squared\\nin order for this to be a perfect square. So c needs to equal negative\\n22 squared. And we can figure out\\nwhat that is. 22 times 22, we could put the\\nnegative later-- actually it's just going to be the same thing\\nbecause the negative times a negative\\nis a positive. 2 times 22 is 44, put a 0. 2 times 22 is 44. Get a 4, get an 8, get a 4. So it's 484. So if we were to rewrite this\\nas x squared minus 44x plus 484, then this is a perfect\\nsquare trinomial. Or we could write\\nit like this. This is x squared minus 2\\ntimes-- or maybe I should write it this way-- plus 2\\ntimes negative 22x plus negative 22 squared. And when you view it that way,\\nit's pretty clear that this is a perfect square, and if you\\nwere to factor it, it's the same thing as x minus\\n22 times x minus 22, or x minus 22 squared. These are all equivalent\\nstatements. \",\n",
       " '14.7.3': \"- [Voiceover] Let's\\nsee if we can take this quadratic expression here, X\\nsquared plus 16 X plus nine and write it in this form. You might be saying, hey Sal, why do I even need to worry about this? And one, it is just\\ngood algebraic practice to be able to manipulate things, but as we'll see in the\\nfuture, what we're about to do is called completing the square. It's a really valuable\\ntechnique for solving quadratics and it's actually the basis for the proof of the quadratic formula which\\nyou'll learn in the future. So it's actually a pretty\\ninteresting technique. So how do we write this in this form? Well one way to think about\\nis if we expanded this X plus A squared, we know if\\nwe square X plus A it would be X squared plus two A X plus A squared, and then you still have that\\nplus B, right over there. So one way to think about it is, let's take this expression, this X squared plus 16 X plus nine, and I'm just gonna write\\nit with a few spaces in it. X squared plus 16 X and then plus nine, just like that. And so, if we say alright,\\nwe have an X squared here. We have an X squared here. If we say that two A X is\\nthe same thing as that, then what's A going to be? So this is two A times X. Well, that means two A is 16 or that A is equal to 8. And so if I want to have\\nan A squared over here, well if A is eight, I\\nwould add an eight squared which would be a 64. Well I can't just add numbers\\nwilly nilly to an expression without changing the\\nvalue of an expression so if don't want to change\\nthe value of the expression, I still need to subtract 64. So notice, all that I have done now, is I just took our original expression and I added 64 and I subtracted 64, so I have not changed the\\nvalue of that expression. But what was valuable about me doing that, is now this first part of the expression, this part right over here, it fits the pattern of a perfect square quadratic right over here. We have X squared plus\\ntwo A X, where A is 8, plus A squared, 64. Once again, how did I get 64? I took half of the 16 and I\\nsquared it to get to the 64. And so the stuff that I just squared off, this is going to be X plus eight squared. X plus eight, squared. Once again I know that because\\nA is eight, A is eight, so this is X plus eight squared, and then all of this business\\non the right hand side. What is nine minus 64? Well 64 minus nine is 55, so this is going to be negative 55. So minus 55, and we're done. We've written this\\nexpression in this form, and what's also called completing the square. \",\n",
       " '14.7.4': '- [Voiceover] So let\\'s see if we can solve this quadratic equation right over here: x squared minus two x minus eight is equal to zero. And actually, they\\'re cutting\\ndown some trees outside, so my apologies if you hear\\nsome chopping of trees. I\\'ll try to ignore it myself. All right. So back to the problem at hand, and there\\'s actually several ways that you could attack this problem. We could just try to\\nfactor the left-hand side and go that way, but the\\nway we\\'re going to tackle it is by completing the square. Now what does that mean? Well that means that I wanna write, I wanna write the left-hand\\nside of this equation into the form x plus a squared plus b, and we\\'ll see if we can write\\nthe left-hand in this form that we can actually solve it in a pretty straightforward way. So let\\'s see if we could do that. Well let\\'s just remind ourselves how we need to rearrange\\nthe left-hand side in order to get to this form. If I were to expand out x plus a squared, let me do that in a different color. So if I were to expand\\nout x plus a squared, that is x squared plus two a x, I\\'ll make that plus sign you can see, plus two a x, plus a squared, and of course you still have\\nthat plus b there, plus b. So let\\'s see if we can\\nwrite this in that form. So, what I\\'m going to do, this is what you typically do when you try to complete the square. All right. The x squared minus two x. Now I\\'m gonna have a little bit of a gap and I\\'m gonna have minus eight, and I have another a little bit of a gap and I\\'m gonna say equals zero. So I just rewrote this equation, but I gave myself some space so I can add or subtract some things that might make it a little bit easier to get into this form. So, if we just match our terms, x squared, x squared, two a x, negative two x. So, if this is two a x, that means that two a is negative two, two a is equal to negative two or a is equal to negative one. Another way to think about it, your a is going to be half of\\nyour first degree coefficient or the coefficient on the x term. So the coefficient of the\\nx term is a negative two, half of that is a negative one. And then we wanna have, and then we want to have an a squared. So if a is negative one, a\\nsquared would be plus one. So let\\'s throw a plus one there. But like we\\'ve done and said before, we can\\'t just willy-nilly add something on one side of equation\\nwithout adding it to the other or without subtracting it\\nagain on that same side. Otherwise, you\\'re fundamentally changing the truth of the equation. So if I add one on that side,\\nI even have to add one on the, if I add one of the left side, I even have to add one on the right side to make the equation still hold true or I could add one and subtract\\none from the left-hand side, so I\\'m not really changing the\\nvalue of the left-hand side. All I\\'ve done is added one and subtracted one from\\nthe left-hand side. Now why did I do this again? Well now, I\\'ve been able, I haven\\'t changed its value. I just added and\\nsubtracted the same thing, but this part of the left-hand side now matches this pattern right over here, x squared plus two a x, where a is negative one,\\nso it\\'s minus two x, plus a squared, plus negative one squared and then this, this part right over here is the plus b. So we already know that b\\nis equal to negative nine. Negative eight minus one is negative nine, and so that\\'s going to be\\nour b right over there. And so we can rewrite this as, what I squared off in green, that\\'s gonna be x plus a squared. So we could write it as x plus and I could write a is negative one. Actually, let me, I could\\nwrite it like that first. x plus a squared or x plus negative one. Well, let\\'s just x minus one,\\nso I\\'m just gonna write it as x minus negative one squared and then we have minus nine, minus nine is equal to zero, is equal to zero. And then I can add nine to both side, so I just have this squared expression on the left-hand side, so let\\'s do that. Let me add nine to both sides. And what I am going to be\\nleft with, so let me just, on the left-hand side, those cancel out. That\\'s why added the nine. I\\'m just gonna be left with\\nthe x minus one squared. It\\'s going to be equal to, on this side, zero plus nine is nine. So if x minus one, let\\nme do that in blue color. So, it\\'s gonna be nine. And so if x minus one squared is nine, if I have something\\nsquare is equal to nine, that means that that something\\nis either going to be the positive or the negative\\nsquare root of nine. So it\\'s either gonna be\\npositive or negative three. So we can say x minus one\\nis equal to positive three or x minus one is equal to negative three and you could see that here. If x minus one is three,\\nthree squared is nine. If x minus one is negative three, negative three squared is nine. And so here, we can just add one to both sides of this equation, add one to both sides of this equation, and you get x is equal to four or x is, if we add one to\\nboth sides of this equation, we get, my digital ink is\\nacting up, I don\\'t know. All right. Then we get x is\\nequal to negative three plus one is negative two. So, x could be equal to four or x could be equal to\\nnegative two, and we\\'re done. Now, some of you might be saying, \"Well, why did we go through the trouble \"of completing the square? \"I might have been able\\nto just factor this \"and then solve it that way.\" And you could have, actually,\\nfor this particular problem. Completing the square is very powerful because you could actually\\nalways apply this, and in the future, what you will learn in the quadratic formula and the quadratic formula\\nactually comes directly out of completing the square. In fact, when you\\'re applying\\nhe quadratic formula, you\\'re essentially applying the result of completing the square. So hopefully you found that fun. ',\n",
       " '14.8.1': '- [Instructor] So we\\'re\\ngiven this equation here. And what I want you to\\ndo is pause this video and see if you can solve it. What x values satisfy the equation? All right, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. So one technique could be just, let\\'s just try to complete the square here on the left-hand side. So to do that, let me write it this way, x squared minus eight x. And then I have, I\\'ll write the plus one out here, is equal to 85. Now if I wanna complete the square, I just have to think, \"What can I add to both\\nsides of this equation \"that could make this part\\nof the left-hand expression \"a perfect square?\" Well, if I look at this\\nnegative eight coefficient on the first-degree term, I could say, \"Okay, let me take half\\nof negative eight.\" That would be negative four. And then, negative four squared\\nis going to be positive 16. So I\\'m gonna add positive\\n16 on the left-hand side. And if I want, I could then subtract a 16 from the left-hand side. Or I could add a 16 on\\nthe right-hand side. Notice, I\\'ve just done the same thing to both sides of this equation. And why was that useful? Well, now what I\\'ve just put in parentheses is a perfect square. This is the same thing\\nas x minus four squared. It was by design. We looked at that negative eight. Half of that is negative four. You square it, you get 16. And you can verify, x minus\\nfour times x minus four is, indeed, equal to this. And then we have plus one is going to be equal to, what\\'s 85 plus 16? That is 101. And now we wanna get rid of this one on the left-hand side. And the easiest way we\\ncan do that is subtract one from both sides. That way we\\'ll just isolate\\nthat x minus four squared. And we are left with x minus four squared. Four squared, these cancel out, is going to be equal to 100. Now if something squared is equal to 100, that means that the something is equal to the positive or the negative\\nsquare root of a hundred. Or that that something,\\nx minus four, is equal to positive or negative 10. Positive or negative 10. All I did is took the plus or minus square root of a hundred. And this makes sense. If I took positive 10\\nsquared, I\\'ll get a hundred. If I take negative 10\\nsquared, I get a hundred. So x minus four could\\nbe either one of those. And now I just add four to\\nboth sides of the equation. And then what do I get? I get x is equal to four plus or minus 10. Or another way of thinking about it, I could write it as x is equal to, four plus 10 is 14. And then four minus 10\\nis equal to negative six. So these are two ways to solve it. But there\\'s other ways\\nto solve this equation. We could, right from the get-go, try to subtract 85 from both sides. Some people feel more\\ncomfortable solving quadratics if they have that quadratic\\nexpression be equal to zero. And if you did that, you\\nwould get x squared minus eight x minus 84 is equal to zero. All I did is I subtracted\\n85 from both sides of this equation to get\\nthis right over here. Now this one we can approach\\nin two different ways. We can complete the square again. Or we could just try to factor. If we complete the square, we\\'re going to see something\\nvery similar to this. Actually, let me just do that really fast. If I look at this part, right over there, I could say x squared minus eight x. And then once again, half of negative eight is negative four. That squared is plus 16. And then I\\'d have minus 84. So let me do that in that blue color so we can keep track. Minus 84. And then if I added 16\\non the left-hand side, I could either add that\\nto the right-hand side so both sides have 16 added to it. Or if I wanna maintain the equality, I could just subtract 16\\nfrom the left-hand side. So I\\'ve added 16, subtracted 16. I haven\\'t changed the\\nleft-hand side\\'s value. And then that would be equal to zero. This part right over here, this is x minus four squared. This part right over here is minus 100 is equal to zero. And then you add a hundred\\nto both sides of this and you get exactly this\\nstep right over here. Now another way that we\\ncould\\'ve approached it without completing the square. We could\\'ve said x squared minus eight x minus 84 is equal to zero. And think about what two numbers if I multiply them I get negative 84. So they\\'d have to have different signs, since when I take their product\\nI get a negative number. And when I add them together\\nI get negative eight. And there we could just\\nlook at the factorization of negative 84, of 84 generally. It could be two times,\\nlet\\'s just think about 84. 84 could be two times 42. And obviously, one of them\\nwould have to be negative, one of them would have to be positive in order to get to negative 84. But the difference\\nbetween these two numbers, if one was positive\\nand one was negative is a lot more than eight. So that doesn\\'t work. So let\\'s try, let\\'s see,\\nI\\'ll do a few in my head. Three times 28. But still that difference\\nis way more than eight. Four times, four times,\\nlet\\'s see, (mumbles). Four times 21, no, that difference between four and 21 is\\nstill larger than eight. Let\\'s see, five doesn\\'t go into it. Six times 14, that\\'s interesting now. Okay, so let\\'s think about this. So six times 14 is equal to 84. One of them has to be negative. And since when we take the\\nsum of the two numbers, we get a negative number, that means the larger one is negative. So let\\'s see, six times\\nnegative 14 is negative 84. Six plus negative 14 is, indeed, equal to negative eight. So we can factor this as x plus six times x minus 14 is equal to zero. And so the product of those\\ntwo things is equal to zero. That means if either of\\nthem is equal to zero, that would make the entire\\nexpression equal to zero. So we could say x plus\\nsix is equal to zero. Or x minus 14 is equal to zero. Subtract six from both sides here. We get x is equal to negative six. Or add 14 to both sides here. Or x is equal to 14. Exactly what we got up here. ',\n",
       " '14.8.2': \"- [Instructor] Let's say we're told that zero is equal to x\\nsquared plus six x plus three, what is an x or what our x is that would satisfy this equation? Pause this video and try to figure it out. All right, now let's\\nwork through it together. So the first thing that I would try to do is see if I could factor\\nthis right hand expression, I have some expression,\\nit's equal to zero. So if I could factor it,\\nthat might help solve. So let's see, can I think of two numbers that when I add them, I get six, and when I take their\\nproduct, I get positive three? Well, if I'm thinking\\njust in terms of integers, three is a prime number, it only has two factors one and three. And let's see one plus\\nthree is not equal to six, so it doesn't look like factoring\\nis going to help me much. So the next thing I'll turn\\nto is completing the square. In fact, completing the square if there are x values that\\nwould satisfy this equation, completing the square\\nwill help us solve it. And the way I do it, I'll\\nsay zero is equal to, let me rewrite the first\\npart, x squared plus six x, and then I'm gonna write\\nthe plus three out here. And my goal is to add something to the right-hand\\nexpression, right over here, and then I'm gonna\\nsubtract that same thing, so I'm not really changing the\\nvalue of the right-hand side. And I wanna add something here that I'm later going to subtract, so that what I have in\\nparentheses is a perfect square. Well, the way to make it a perfect square, and we've talked about\\nthis in other videos when we introduced ourselves\\nto completing the square, is we'll look at this first degree coefficient right over\\nhere, this positive six, and say, okay, half of\\nthat is positive three, and if we were to square\\nthat, we would get nine. So let's add a nine there. And then we could also subtract a nine. Notice, we haven't changed the value of the right-hand side expression, we're adding nine and\\nwe're subtracting nine. And actually, the parentheses\\nare just there to help it make a little bit more\\nvisually clear to us, but you don't even need the parentheses, you would essentially get the same result. But then what happens if we\\nsimplify this a little bit? Well, what I just showed you, let me do it in this green blue color, this thing can be rewritten\\nas x plus three squared. That's why we added nine there, we said, all right, we're\\ngonna be dealing with a three 'cause three is half of six. And if we squared three,\\nwe get a nine there. And then this second\\npart, right over here, three minus nine, that's\\nequal to negative six. So we could write it like this, zero is equal to x plus\\nthree squared minus six. And now what we can do is\\nisolate this x plus three squared by adding six to both\\nsides, so let's do that. Let's add six there, let's add six there. And what we get on the left-hand side, we get six is equal to,\\non the right-hand side, we just get x plus three squared. And now we can take the\\nsquare root of both sides, and we could say that the plus\\nor minus square root of six is equal to x plus three. And if this doesn't make full sense, just pause the video a little\\nbit and think about it. If I'm saying that something\\nsquared is equal to six, that means that the something is either going to be the\\npositive square root of six, or the negative square root of six. And so now we can, if\\nwe wanna solve for x, we can just subtract\\nthree from both sides. So let's subtract three from\\nboth sides, and what do we get? We get on the right-hand side,\\nwe just are left with an x, and that's going to be\\nequal to negative three plus or minus the square root of six. And we are done. And obviously we could\\nrewrite this and say, x could be equal to negative three plus the square root of six, or x could be equal to negative three minus the square root of six. \",\n",
       " '14.8.3': \"We're asked to\\ncomplete the square to solve 4x squared plus\\n40x minus 300 is equal to 0. So let me just rewrite it. So 4x squared plus 40x\\nminus 300 is equal to 0. So just as a first\\nstep here, I don't like having this 4 out\\nfront as a coefficient on the x squared term. I'd prefer if that was a 1. So let's just divide both\\nsides of this equation by 4. So let's just divide\\neverything by 4. So this divided\\nby 4, this divided by 4, that divided by 4,\\nand the 0 divided by 4. Just dividing both sides by 4. So this will simplify\\nto x squared plus 10x. And I can obviously\\ndo that, because as long as whatever I do\\nto the left hand side, I also do the right\\nhand side, that will make the equality\\ncontinue to be valid. So that's why I can do that. So 40 divided by 4 is 10x. And then 300 divided\\nby 4 is what? That is 75. Let me verify that. 4 goes into 30 seven times. 7 times 4 is 28. You subtract, you\\nget a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0. 4 goes into 20 five times. 5 times 4 is 20. Subtract zero. So it goes 75 times. This is minus 75 is equal to 0. And right when you look at\\nthis, just the way it's written, you might try to factor\\nthis in some way. But it's pretty clear this\\nis not a complete square, or this is not a perfect\\nsquare trinomial. Because if you look at\\nthis term right here, this 10, half of this 10 is 5. And 5 squared is not 75. So this is not a perfect square. So what we want to\\ndo is somehow turn whatever we have on\\nthe left hand side into a perfect square. And I'm going to start out by\\nkind of getting this 75 out of the way. You'll sometimes\\nsee it where people leave the 75 on\\nthe left hand side. I'm going to put on\\nthe right hand side just so it kind of clears\\nthings up a little bit. So let's add 75 to both\\nsides to get rid of the 75 from the left hand\\nside of the equation. And so we get x squared plus\\n10x, and then negative 75 plus 75. Those guys cancel out. And I'm going to\\nleave some space here, because we're going\\nto add something here to complete the square\\nthat is equal to 75. So all I did is add 75 to\\nboth sides of this equation. Now, in this step,\\nthis is really the meat of\\ncompleting the square. I want to add something to\\nboth sides of this equation. I can't add to only one\\nside of the equation. So I want to add something to\\nboth sides of this equation so that this left hand side\\nbecomes a perfect square. And the way we can do that,\\nand saw this in the last video where we constructed a\\nperfect square trinomial, is that this last\\nterm-- or I should say, what we see on\\nthe left hand side, not the last term, this expression\\non the left hand side, it will be a perfect square if\\nwe have a constant term that is the square of half of the\\ncoefficient on the first degree term. So the coefficient here is 10. Half of 10 is 5. 5 squared is 25. So I'm going to add 25\\nto the left hand side. And of course, in order to\\nmaintain the equality, anything I do the left hand\\nside, I also have to do to the right hand side. And now we see that this\\nis a perfect square. We say, hey, what two numbers\\nif I add them I get 10 and when I multiply\\nthem I get 25? Well, that's 5 and 5. So when we factor this, what\\nwe see on the left hand side simplifies to, this\\nis x plus 5 squared. x plus 5 times x plus 5. And you can look at\\nthe videos on factoring if you find that confusing. Or you could look\\nat the last video on constructing perfect\\nsquare trinomials. I encourage you to\\nsquare this and see that you get exactly this. And this will be equal to 75\\nplus 25, which is equal to 100. And so now we're saying\\nthat something squared is equal to 100. So really, this is\\nsomething right over here-- if I say something squared\\nis equal to 100, that means that that something is\\none of the square roots of 100. And we know that 100\\nhas two square roots. It has positive 10 and\\nit has negative 10. So we could say that x\\nplus 5, the something that we were\\nsquaring, that must be one of the square roots of 100. So that must be equal to the\\nplus or minus square root of 100, or plus or minus 10. Or we could separate it out. We could say that x\\nplus 5 is equal to 10, or x plus 5 is equal\\nto negative 10. On this side right\\nhere, I can just subtract 5 from both\\nsides of this equation and I would get-- I'll\\njust write it out. Subtracting 5 from both\\nsides, I get x is equal to 5. And over here, I\\ncould subtract 5 from both sides again-- I\\nsubtracted 5 in both cases-- subtract 5 again and I can\\nget x is equal to negative 15. So those are my two\\nsolutions that I got to solve this equation. We can verify that they actually\\nwork, and I'll do that in blue. So let's try with 5. I'll just do one of them. I'll leave the\\nother one for you. I'll leave the other one for\\nyou to verify that it works. So 4 times x squared. So 4 times 25 plus\\n40 times 5 minus 300 needs to be equal to 0. 4 times 25 is 100. 40 times 5 is 200. We're going to\\nsubtract that 300. 100 plus 200 minus 300,\\nthat definitely equals 0. So x equals 5 worked. And I think you'll find that\\nx equals negative 15 will also work when you substitute it\\ninto this right over here. \",\n",
       " '14.8.4': \"Use completing the square\\nto find the roots of the quadratic equation right here. And when anyone talks about\\nroots, this just means find the x's where y is equal to 0. That's what a root is. A root is an x value that will\\nmake this quadratic function equal 0, that will\\nmake y equal 0. So to find the x's, let's\\njust make y equal 0 and then solve for x. So we get 0 is equal to 4x\\nsquared plus 40x, plus 280. Now, the first step that we\\nmight want to do, just because it looks like all three of these\\nterms are divisible by 4, is just divide both sides\\nof this equation by 4. That'll make our math a\\nlittle bit simpler. So let's just divide everything\\nby 4 here. If we just divide everything by\\n4, we get 0 is equal to x squared plus 10x, plus-- 280\\ndivided by 4 is 70-- plus 70. Now, they say use completing the\\nsquare, and actually, let me write that 70 a little bit\\nfurther out, and you'll see why I did that in a second. So let me just write a plus 70\\nover here, just to have kind of an awkward space here. And you'll see what I'm about\\nto do with this space, that has everything to do with\\ncompleting the square. So they say use completing the\\nsquare, which means, turn this, if you can, into\\na perfect square. Turn at least part of this\\nexpression into a perfect square, and then we can use that\\nto actually solve for x. So how do we turn this into\\na perfect square? Well, we have a 10x here. And we know that we can turn\\nthis into a perfect square trinomial if we take 1/2 of the\\n10, which is 5, and then we square that. So 1/2 of 10 is 5, you square\\nit, you add a 25. Now, you can't just willy-nilly\\nadd a 25 to one side of the equation without\\ndoing something to the other, or without just subtracting\\nthe 25 right here. Right? Think about it, I have not\\nchanged the equation. I've added 25 and I've\\nsubtracted 25. So I've added nothing to\\nthe right-hand side. I could add a billion and\\nsubtract a billion and not change the equation. So I have not changed the\\nequation at all right here. But what I have done is I've\\nmade it possible to express these three terms as\\na perfect square. That right there,\\n2 times 5 is 10. 5 squared is 25. So that is x plus 5 squared. And if you don't believe\\nme, multiply it out. You're going to have an x\\nsquared plus 5x, plus 5x, which will give you 10x, plus\\n5 squared, which is 25. So those first three terms\\nbecome that, and then the second two terms, right there,\\nyou just add them. Let's see, negative\\n25 plus 70. Let's see, negative 20 plus 70\\nwould be positive 50, and then you have another 5,\\nso it's plus 45. So we've just algebraically\\nmanipulated this equation. And we get 0 is equal to x\\nplus 5 squared, plus 45. Now, we could've, from the\\nbeginning if we wanted, we could've tried to factor it. But what we're going to do here,\\nthis will always work. Even if you have crazy decimal\\nnumbers here, you can solve for x using the method\\nwe're doing here, completing the square. So to solve for x, let's just\\nsubtract 45 from both sides of this equation. And so the left-hand side of\\nthis equation becomes negative 45, and the right-hand\\nside will be just the x plus 5 squared. These guys, right here,\\ncancel out. Now, normally if I look at\\nsomething like this I'll say, OK, let's just take the\\nsquare root of both sides of this equation. And so you might be tempted to\\ntake the square root of both sides of this equation, but\\nimmediately when you do that, you'll notice something\\nstrange. We're trying to take\\nthe square root of a negative number. And if we're dealing with real\\nnumbers, which is everything we've dealt with so far, you\\ncan't take a square root of a negative number. There is no real number that if\\nyou square it will give you a negative number. So it's not possible-- I don't\\ncare what you make x-- it is not possible to add x to\\n5 and square it, and get a negative number. So there is no x that can\\nsatisfy-- if we assume that is x is a real number-- that can\\nsatisfy this equation. Because I don't care what x you\\nput here, what real x you put here, you add 5 to it, you\\nsquare it, there's no way you're going to get\\na negative number. So there's no x that can satisfy\\nthis equation, so we could say there are no-- and\\nI'm using the word real because in Algebra 2 you'll\\nlearn that there are things called complex numbers, but\\ndon't worry about that right now-- but there no real roots\\nto the quadratic equation. And we're done. And actually, if you had tried\\nto factor it, you would have found it very difficult,\\nbecause this is not a factorable expression right\\nhere, and you know it because there's no real roots. \",\n",
       " '14.8.5': \"In the last video, I told you\\nthat if you had a quadratic equation of the form ax squared\\nplus bx, plus c is equal to zero, you could use the\\nquadratic formula to find the solutions to\\nthis equation. And the quadratic\\nformula was x. The solutions would be equal\\nto negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared\\nminus 4ac, all of that over 2a. And we learned how to use it. You literally just substitute\\nthe numbers a for a, b for b, c for c, and then it gives you\\ntwo answers, because you have a plus or a minus right there. What I want to do\\nin this video is actually prove it to you. Prove that using, essentially\\ncompleting the square, I can get from that to that\\nright over there. So the first thing I want to\\ndo, so that I can start completing the square from this\\npoint right here, is-- let me rewrite the equation\\nright here-- so we have ax-- let me do it in a different\\ncolor-- I have ax squared plus bx, plus c is equal to 0. So the first I want to do is\\ndivide everything by a, so I just have a 1 out here\\nas a coefficient. So you divide everything by a,\\nyou get x squared plus b over ax, plus c over a, is equal\\nto 0 over a, which is still just 0. Now we want to-- well, let me\\nget the c over a term on to the right-hand side,\\nso let's subtract c over a from both sides. And we get x squared plus b over\\na x, plus-- well, I'll just leave it blank there,\\nbecause this is gone now; we subtracted it from both sides--\\nis equal to negative c over a I left a space\\nthere so that we can complete the square. And you saw in the completing\\nthe square video, you literally just take 1/2 of this\\ncoefficient right here and you square it. So what is b over\\na divided by 2? Or what is 1/2 times b over a? Well, that is just b over 2a,\\nand, of course, we are going to square it. You take 1/2 of this\\nand you square it. That's what we do in completing\\na square, so that we can turn this into the\\nperfect square of a binomial. Now, of course, we cannot just\\nadd the b over 2a squared to the left-hand side. We have to add it\\nto both sides. So you have a plus b over 2a\\nsquared there as well. Now what happens? Well, this over here, this\\nexpression right over here, this is the exact same thing as\\nx plus b over 2a squared. And if you don't believe me, I'm\\ngoing to multiply it out. That x plus b over 2a squared\\nis x plus b over 2a, times x plus b over 2a. x times\\nx is x squared. x times b over 2a is\\nplus b over 2ax. You have b over 2a times x,\\nwhich is another b over 2ax, and then you have b over 2a\\ntimes b over 2a, that is plus b over 2a squared. That and this are the same\\nthing, because these two middle terms, b over 2a plus b\\nover 2a, that's the same thing as 2b over 2ax, which is the\\nsame thing as b over ax. So this simplifies to x squared\\nplus b over ax, plus b over 2a squared, which is\\nexactly what we have written right there. That was the whole point of\\nadding this term to both sides, so it becomes\\na perfect square. So the left-hand side\\nsimplifies to this. The right-hand side, maybe\\nnot quite as simple. Maybe we'll leave it the\\nway it is right now. Actually, let's simplify\\nit a little bit. So the right-hand side,\\nwe can rewrite it. This is going to be equal\\nto-- well, this is going to be b squared. I'll write that term first. This\\nis b-- let me do it in green so we can follow along. So that term right there\\ncan be written as b squared over 4a square. And what's this term? What would that become? This would become-- in order\\nto have 4a squared as the denominator, we have to multiply\\nthe numerator and the denominator by 4a. So this term right\\nhere will become minus 4ac over 4a squared. And you can verify for yourself\\nthat that is the same thing as that. I just multiplied the\\nnumerator and the denominator by 4a. In fact, the 4's cancel out and\\nthen this a cancels out and you just have a c over a. So these, this and that\\nare equivalent. I just switched which I write\\nfirst. And you might already be seeing the beginnings of the\\nquadratic formula here. So this I can rewrite. This I can rewrite. The right-hand side, right\\nhere, I can rewrite as b squared minus 4ac, all of\\nthat over 4a squared. This is looking very close. Notice, b squared minus 4ac,\\nit's already appearing. We don't have a square root yet,\\nbut we haven't taken the square root of both\\nsides of this equation, so let's do that. So if you take the square root\\nof both sides, the left-hand side will just become x plus--\\nlet me scroll down a little bit-- x plus b over 2a is going\\nto be equal to the plus or minus square root\\nof this thing. And the square root of this\\nis the square root of the numerator over the square\\nroot of the denominator. So it's going to be the plus or\\nminus the square root of b squared minus 4ac over the\\nsquare root of 4a squared. Now, what is the square\\nroot of 4a squared? It is 2a, right? 2a squared is 4a squared. The square root of this\\nis that right here. So to go from here to here, I\\njust took the square root of both sides of this equation. Now, this is looking very\\nclose to the quadratic. We have a b squared minus\\n4ac over 2a, now we just essentially have to subtract\\nthis b over 2a from both sides of the equation and\\nwe're done. So let's do that. So if you subtract the b over\\n2a from both sides of this equation, what do you get? You get x is equal to negative\\nb over 2a, plus or minus the square root of b squared minus\\n4ac over 2a, common denominator. So this is equal\\nto negative b. Let me do this in a new color. So it's orange. Negative b plus or minus the\\nsquare root of b squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. And we are done! By completing the square with\\njust general coefficients in front of our a, b and c, we\\nwere able to derive the quadratic formula. Just like that. Hopefully you found that as\\nentertaining as I did. \",\n",
       " '14.9.1': \"- [Instructor] In this video, we're gonna talk about\\na few of the pitfalls that someone might encounter while they're trying to solve a quadratic equation like this. Why is it a quadratic equation? Well, it's a quadratic because it has this second\\ndegree term right over here and it's an equation because\\nI have something on both sides of an equal sign. So one strategy that people might try is, well, I have something squared, why don't I just try to take\\nthe square root of both sides? And if you did that, you would get the square root of x squared\\nplus four x plus three is equal to the square\\nroot of negative one. And you immediately see a few problems. Even if this wasn't a negative one here, that's the most obvious problem. But even if this was\\na positive value here, how do you simplify or how do you somehow\\nisolate the x over here? You've pretty quickly hit a dead end. So just willy nilly, taking the square root of\\nboth sides of a quadratic is not going to be too helpful. So I'll put a big X over there. Another strategy that sometimes\\npeople will try to go for is to isolate the x squared first. So you could imagine, let me just rewrite it. X squared plus four x plus\\nthree is equal to negative one. They might say, let's\\nisolate that x squared by subtracting four x from both sides and subtracting three from both sides. And then what happens? On the left hand side, you do indeed isolate the x squared, and on the right hand side, you get negative four x minus four. And now, someone might say, if I take the square root of both sides, I could get, I'll just write that down. Square root of x squared is equal to, and you could try to take\\nthe plus of minus of one side to make sure you're\\nhitting the negative roots. Negative four x minus four. And you could get something like this, you would get x is equal to plus or minus the square root\\nof negative four x minus four, but this still doesn't help you. You still don't know what x is, and it's really not clear what to do with this algebraically. So this is yet another dead end. Now, there's some cases in which this strategy would have worked. In fact, it would have worked if you did not have\\nthis first degree term. If you did not have this\\nx term, so to speak. Then this strategy would have worked assuming that there are some solutions. But if you have an x term like this and it doesn't cancel out somehow, you know, if there was another\\nfour x on the other side, then you could subtract\\nfour x from both sides, and they would disappear. But if can't make these things disappear, this strategy that I've just outlined is not going to be a productive one. Now another strategy that\\nyou'll sometimes see people use, especially when they\\nsee something like this, let me rewrite it. X squared plus four x plus\\nthree is equal to negative one. They immediately go into factoring mode. They say, hey, wait, I think I\\nmight be able to factor this. I can think of two numbers\\nthat add up to four and whose product is three. Maybe three and one. And then they immediately factor\\nthis left hand expression, say that's going to be x plus three times x plus one, and then that's going to\\nbe equal to negative one. And then they either are\\nabout to make a mistake, this is actually algebraically valid. But they either make a mistake or they realize that\\nthey're at a dead end. Because just saying that\\nsomething times something is equal to negative one doesn't help you a ton. Because it's not clear\\nyet, how you'd solve for x. Another thing, try to do is, is they'll immediately say, okay, therefore x is\\nequal to negative three or x is equal to negative one because negative three will\\nmake this first term zero and negative one, or negative one would\\nmake the second term zero. But remember, this would only be true if you're multiplying two things and you got zero as their product, then the solutions would be anything that made either one of\\nthose terms equal to zero. But that's not what\\nwe're dealing with here. Here we're taking the product\\nis equal to negative one. So in order to factor like this and make headway in most cases, you're going to wanna have a zero on the right hand side over here. And that's also true if you're trying to apply\\nthe quadratic formula. A lot of folks would say, okay, I see a quadratic\\nequation right over here. Let me just apply the quadratic formula. They say, if I have something of the form ax squared plus bx plus\\nc is equal to zero. The quadratic formula would say that the roots are gonna be x is equal to negative b plus or minus the square root\\nof b squared minus four ac, all of that over two a. And so they'll immediately say, all right, I can recognize a here, as just being a one, there's a one coefficient\\nimplicitly there, b is four, c is three. And they'll say, okay, x\\nis equal to negative four plus or minus the square\\nroot of b squared, which is 16, minus four\\ntimes one, times three, all of that over two times one. But there's a problem. The quadratic formula applies when the left hand side is equal to zero. That's not what we have over here. So we're falling into that same pitfall. So everything I just did, none of this is a good idea. So the way to approach this, if you want zero over here, you wanna add one on the right hand side, and if you wanna maintain the equality, you have to add a one\\non the left hand side. And so you're going to get x squared plus four x plus\\nfour is equal to zero. And now you could use\\nthe quadratic formula or you could factor. You might recognize two\\nplus two is equal to four. Two times two is equal to four. So you could say x plus two times x plus two is equal to zero. And so in this case, you say, all right, x could be\\nequal to negative two or x could be equal to\\nnegative two. (chuckles) So this one only has one solution, x is equal to negative two. But the key is to recognize that you need the zero on\\nthe right hand side there, if you wanna use a quadratic formula or if you wanna use factoring\\nand the zero product property. \",\n",
       " '14.10.1': \"I have an equation right here. It's a second degree equation. It's a quadratic. And I know its graph is\\ngoing to be a parabola. Just as a review, that means it\\nlooks something like this or it looks something like that. Because the coefficient on the\\nx squared term here is positive, I know it's going to be an\\nupward opening parabola. And I am curious about the\\nvertex of this parabola. And if I have an upward\\nopening parabola, the vertex is going to\\nbe the minimum point. If I had a downward\\nopening parabola, then the vertex would\\nbe the maximum point. So I'm really trying\\nto find the x value. I don't know actually where\\nthis does intersect the x-axis or if it does it all. But I want to find\\nthe x value where this function takes\\non a minimum value. Now, there's many\\nways to find a vertex. Probably the easiest,\\nthere's a formula for it. And we talk about where that\\ncomes from in multiple videos, where the vertex of a\\nparabola or the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola. So the x-coordinate\\nof the vertex is just equal to\\nnegative b over 2a. And the negative b, you're just\\ntalking about the coefficient, or b is the coefficient\\non the first degree term, is on the coefficient\\non the x term. And a is the coefficient\\non the x squared term. So this is going to be\\nequal to b is negative 20. So it's negative\\n20 over 2 times 5. Well, this is going to\\nbe equal to positive 20 over 10, which is equal to 2. And so to find the y\\nvalue of the vertex, we just substitute\\nback into the equation. The y value is going\\nto be 5 times 2 squared minus 20 times 2 plus 15,\\nwhich is equal to let's see. This is 5 times 4, which is 20,\\nminus 40, which is negative 20, plus 15 is negative 5. So just like that, we're able\\nto figure out the coordinate. This coordinate right over here\\nis the point 2, negative 5. Now it's not so\\nsatisfying just to plug and chug a formula like this. And we'll see where\\nthis comes from when you look at the\\nquadratic formula. This is the first term. It's the x value that's\\nhalfway in between the roots. So that's one way\\nto think about it. But another way to do\\nit, and this probably will be of more lasting\\nhelp for you in your life, because you might\\nforget this formula. It's really just try to\\nre-manipulate this equation so you can spot\\nits minimum point. And we're going to do that\\nby completing the square. So let me rewrite that. And what I'll do is out\\nof these first two terms, I'll factor out a 5, because I\\nwant to complete a square here and I'm going to leave\\nthis 15 out to the right, because I'm going to have\\nto manipulate that as well. So it is 5 times x\\nsquared minus 4x. And then I have\\nthis 15 out here. And I want to write this\\nas a perfect square. And we just have\\nto remind ourselves that if I have x plus\\na squared, that's going to be x squared\\nplus 2ax plus a squared. So if I want to turn something\\nthat looks like this, 2ax, into a perfect\\nsquare, I just have to take half of this coefficient\\nand square it and add it right over here in order\\nto make it look like that. So I'm going to do\\nthat right over here. So if I take half of negative\\n4, that's negative 2. If I square it, that is\\ngoing to be positive 4. I have to be very careful here. I can't just willy nilly\\nadd a positive 4 here. I have equality here. If they were equal\\nbefore adding the 4, then they're not going to\\nbe equal after adding the 4. So I have to do proper\\naccounting here. I either have to add 4 to both\\nsides or I should be careful. I have to add the same\\namount to both sides or subtract the\\nsame amount again. Now, the reason why I\\nwas careful there is I didn't just add 4 to the right\\nhand side of the equation. Remember, the 4 is\\ngetting multiplied by 5. I have added 20 to the right\\nhand side of the equation. So if I want to make\\nthis balance out, if I want the equality\\nto still be true, I either have to\\nnow add 20 to y or I have to subtract 20 from\\nthe right hand side. So I'll do that. I'll subtract 20 from\\nthe right hand side. So I added 5 times 4. If you were to distribute\\nthis, you'll see that. I could have literally, up\\nhere, said hey, I'm adding 20 and I'm subtracting 20. This is the exact same\\nthing that I did over here. If you distribute the 5, it\\nbecomes 5x squared minus 20x plus 20 plus 15 minus 20. Exactly what's up here. The whole point of\\nthis is that now I can write this in\\nan interesting way. I could write this as y is equal\\nto 5 times x minus 2 squared, and then 15 minus 20 is minus 5. So the whole point of this is\\nnow to be able to inspect this. When does this equation\\nhit a minimum value? Well, we know that this\\nterm right over here is always going to\\nbe non-negative. Or we could say\\nit's always going to be greater than\\nor equal to 0. This whole thing is going\\nto hit a minimum value when this term is equal\\nto 0 or when x equals 2. When x equals 2, we're going\\nto hit a minimum value. And when x equals\\n2, what happens? Well, this whole term is 0\\nand y is equal to negative 5. The vertex is 2, negative 5. \",\n",
       " '14.10.2': \"We're asked to graph\\nthe following equation y equals 5x squared\\nminus 20x plus 15. So let me get my\\nlittle scratch pad out. So it's y is equal to 5x\\nsquared minus 20x plus 15. Now there's many\\nways to graph this. You can just take three\\nvalues for x and figure out what the\\ncorresponding values for y are and just graph\\nthose three points. And three points actually\\nwill determine a parabola. But I want to do something a\\nlittle bit more interesting. I want to find the places. So if we imagine our axes. This is my x-axis. That's my y-axis. And this is our curve. So the parabola might\\nlook something like this. I want to first figure out where\\ndoes this parabola intersect the x-axis. And as we have already\\nseen, intersecting the x-axis is the same thing\\nas saying when it does this when does y equal\\n0 for this problem? Or another way of\\nsaying it, when does this 5x squared\\nminus 20x plus 15, when does this equal 0? So I want to figure\\nout those points. And then I also want to\\nfigure out the point exactly in between, which is the vertex. And if I can graph\\nthose three points then I should be all set with\\ngraphing this parabola. So as I just said,\\nwe're going to try to solve the equation 5x\\nsquared minus 20x plus 15 is equal to 0. Now the first thing\\nI like to do whenever I see a coefficient out here on\\nthe x squared term that's not a 1, is to see if I can\\ndivide everything by that term to try to simplify\\nthis a little bit. And maybe this will get us\\ninto a factor-able form. And it does look like every\\nterm here is divisible by 5. So I will divide by 5. So I'll divide both sides\\nof this equation by 5. And so that will give\\nme-- these cancel out and I'm left with x squared\\nminus 20 over 5 is 4x. Plus 15 over 5 is 3 is\\nequal to 0 over 5 is just 0. And now we can attempt to\\nfactor this left-hand side. We say are there two numbers\\nwhose product is positive 3? The fact that their\\nproduct is positive tells you they both\\nmust be positive. And whose sum is negative\\n4, which tells you well they both must be negative. If we're getting a\\nnegative sum here. And the one that\\nprobably jumps out of your mind--\\nand you might want to review the videos\\non factoring quadratics if this is not so fresh-- is\\na negative 3 and negative 1 seem to work. Negative 3 times negative 1. Negative 3 times\\nnegative 1 is 3. Negative 3 plus negative\\n1 is negative 4. So this will factor out as\\nx minus 3 times x minus 1. And on the right-hand\\nside, we still have that being equal to 0. And now we can think about what\\nx's will make this expression 0, and if they make\\nthis expression 0, well they're going to\\nmake this expression 0. Which is going to make\\nthis expression equal to 0. And so this will be true if\\neither one of these is 0. So x minus 3 is equal to 0. Or x minus 1 is equal to 0. This is true, and you can\\nadd 3 to both sides of this. This is true when\\nx is equal to 3. This is true when\\nx is equal to 1. So we were able to figure\\nout these two points right over here. This is x is equal to 1. This is x is equal to 3. So this is the point 1 comma 0. This is the point 3 comma 0. And so the last one\\nI want to figure out, is this point right\\nover here, the vertex. Now the vertex always\\nsits exactly smack dab between the roots,\\nwhen you do have roots. Sometimes you might not\\nintersect the x-axis. So we already know what its\\nx-coordinate is going to be. It's going to be 2. And now we just have\\nto substitute back in to figure out its y-coordinate. When x equals 2, y is going to\\nbe equal to 5 times 2 squared minus 20 times 2 plus 15,\\nwhich is equal to-- let's see, this is equal to 2 squared is 4. This is 20 minus 40 plus 15. So this is going\\nto be negative 20 plus 15, which is\\nequal to negative 5. So this is the point\\n2 comma negative 5. And so now we can go\\nback to the exercise and actually plot\\nthese three points. 1 comma 0, 2 comma\\nnegative 5, 3 comma 0. So let's do that. So first I'll do the vertex\\nat 2 comma negative 5, which is right there. And now we also know\\none of the times it intersects the\\nx-axis is at 1 comma 0. And the other time\\nis at 3 comma 0. And now we can check our answer. And we got it right. \",\n",
       " '14.10.3': \"A ball is shot into the air\\nfrom the edge of a building, 50 feet above the ground. Its initial velocity\\nis 20 feet per second. The equation h--\\nand I'm guessing h is for height-- is equal to\\nnegative 16t squared plus 20t plus 50 can be used to\\nmodel the height of the ball after t seconds. And I think in this\\nproblem they just want us to accept this\\nformula, although we do derive formulas\\nlike this and show why it works for this type of\\nproblem in the Khan Academy physics playlist. But for here, we'll just go\\nwith the flow on this example. So they give us\\nthe equation that can be used to model the height\\nof the ball after t seconds, and then say about\\nhow long does it take for the ball\\nto hit the ground. So if this is the\\nheight, the ground is when the height\\nis equal to 0. So hitting the ground\\nmeans-- this literally means that h is equal to 0. So we need to figure out at\\nwhich times does h equal 0. So we're really\\nsolving the equation 0 is equal to negative 16t\\nsquared plus 20t plus 50. And if you want to simplify\\nthis a little bit-- let's see, everything here is\\ndivisible at least by 2. And let's divide\\neverything by negative 2, just so that we can get rid\\nof this negative leading coefficient. So you divide the left\\nhand side by negative 2, you still get a 0. Negative 16 divided\\nby negative 2 is 8. So 8t squared. 20 divided by negative\\n2 is negative 10. Minus 10t. 50 divided by negative\\n2 is minus 25. And so we have 8t squared minus\\n10t minus 25 is equal to 0. Or if you're comfortable with\\nthis on the left hand side, we can put on the\\nleft hand side. We could just say\\nthis is equal to 0. And now we solve. And we could complete\\nthis square here, or we can just apply the\\nquadratic formula, which is derived from\\ncompleting the square. And we have this\\nin standard form. We know that this is our a. This right over here is our b. And this over here is our c. And the quadratic formula\\ntells us that the roots-- and in this case, it's in\\nterms of the variable t-- are going to be\\nequal to negative b plus or minus the\\nsquare root of b squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. So if we apply it, we get\\nt is equal to negative b. b is negative 10. So negative negative 10 is\\ngoing to be positive 10. Plus or minus the square\\nroot of negative 10 squared. Well, that's just positive\\n100, minus 4 times a, which is 8, times c,\\nwhich is negative 25. And all of that over 2a. a Is 8. So 2 times 8 is 16. And this over here,\\nwe have a-- let's see if we can simplify\\nthis a little bit. The negative sign,\\nnegative times a negative, these are going to be positive. 4 times 25 is 100,\\ntimes 8 is 800. So all that simplifies to 800. And we have 100 plus 800\\nunder the radical sign. So this is equal\\nto 10 plus or minus the square root of 900,\\nall of that over 16. And this is equal to 10 plus\\nor minus-- square root of 900 is 30-- over 16. And so we get time is equal\\nto 10 plus 30 over 16, is 40 over 16, which is\\nthe same thing if we divide the numerator and denominator\\nby 4 to simplify it as 10 over-- or actually even better, divide\\nit by 8-- that's 5 over 2. So that's one solution,\\nif we add the 30. If we subtract the 30,\\nwe'd get 10 minus 30. Or t is equal to 10 minus 30,\\nwhich is negative 20 over 16. Divide the numerator and\\nthe denominator by 4, you get negative 5 over 4. Now, we have to remember,\\nwe're trying to find a time. And so a time, at\\nleast in this problem that we're dealing\\nwith, we should only think about positive times. We want to figure out\\nhow much time has taken-- how long does it take for\\nthe ball to hit the ground? We don't want to\\ngo back in time. So we don't want our\\nnegative answer right here. So we only want to think\\nabout our positive answer. And so this tells us that the\\nonly root that should work is 5/2. And we assume that\\nthis is in seconds. So this is in 5/2 seconds. I wouldn't worry too much\\nabout the physics here. I think they really just want us\\nto apply the quadratic formula to this modeling situation. The physics, we go\\ninto a lot more depth and give you the conceptual\\nunderstanding on our physics playlist. But let's verify that we\\ndefinitely are at a height of 0 at 5/2 seconds, or\\nt is equal to 5/2. This expression right over here\\ndoes give us h is equal to 0. So we have-- let's try it out. We have negative 16\\ntimes 5/2 squared plus 20 times 5/2 plus 50. This needs to be equal to 0. So this is negative\\n16 times 25/4 plus-- let's see, if we divide\\n20 by 2, we get 10. If we divide 2 by 2, we get 1. So 10 times 5 is going to be 50. Plus 50. This needs to be equal to 0. Negative 16 divided\\nby 4 is negative 4. 4 divided by 4 is 1. So you have negative 4\\ntimes 25, which is 100. Plus 50-- oh, sorry. Negative 4 times\\n25 is negative 100. Plus 50, plus 50\\nagain is equal to 0. And so we have negative\\n100 plus another 100. Well, that's definitely\\ngoing to be equal to 0. We get 0 equals 0. And it all checks out. We hit the ground\\nafter 5/2 seconds. Or another way to think\\nabout it is 2.5 seconds. t is equal to 5/2\\nseconds, or 2.5 seconds. \",\n",
       " '14.11.1': \"I have a function here defined\\nas x squared minus 5x plus 6. And what I want\\nus to think about is what other forms we can\\nwrite this function in if we, say, wanted to find the\\n0s of this function. If we wanted to figure out where\\ndoes this function intersect the x-axis, what form\\nwould we put this in? And then another form\\nfor maybe finding out what's the minimum\\nvalue of this. We see that we have a positive\\ncoefficient on the x squared term. This is going to be an\\nupward-opening parabola. But what's the\\nminimum point of this? Or even better, what's the\\nvertex of this parabola right over here? So if the function looks\\nsomething like this, we could use one\\nform of the function to figure out where does\\nit intersect the x-axis. So where does it\\nintersect the x-axis? And maybe we can manipulate\\nit to get another form to figure out what's\\nthe minimum point. What's this point right\\nover here for this function? I don't even know if the\\nfunction looks like this. So I encourage you\\nto pause this video and try to manipulate this\\ninto those two different forms. So let's work on it. So in order to find the\\nroots, the easiest thing I can think of doing\\nis trying to factor this quadratic\\nexpression which is being used to define\\nthis function. So we could think\\nabout, well, let's think of two numbers whose\\nproduct is positive 6 and whose sum is negative 5. So since their\\nproduct is positive, we know that they\\nhave the same sign. And if they have the same sign\\nbut we get to a negative value, that means they both\\nmust be negative. So let's see-- negative 2\\ntimes negative 3 is positive 6. Negative 2 plus negative\\n3 is negative 5. So we could rewrite f of x. And so let me write it this way. We could write f of\\nx as being equal to x minus 2 times x minus 3. Now, how does this help\\nus find the zeroes? Well, in what situations is\\nthis right-hand expression, is this expression on the right\\nhand going to be equal to 0? Well, it's the product\\nof these two expressions. If either one of these is equal\\nto 0, 0 times anything is 0. 0 times anything else is 0. So this whole thing is going to\\nbe 0 if x minus 2 is equal to 0 or x minus 3 is equal to 0. Add 2 to both sides\\nof this equation. You get x is equal to\\n2 or x is equal to 3. So those are the two\\nzeroes for this function, I guess you could say. And we could already\\nthink about it a little bit in\\nterms of graphing it. So let's try to\\ngraph this thing. So this is x equals 1. This is x equals 2. This is x equals 3\\nright over there. So that's our x-axis. That, you could say, is our\\ny is equal to f of x axis. And we're seeing that we\\nintersect both here and here. When x is equal to 2,\\nthis f of x is equal to 0. When x is equal to 3,\\nf of x is equal to 0. And you could substitute\\neither of these values into the original expression. And you'll see it's\\ngoing to get you to 0 because that is\\nthe same thing as that. Now, what about the vertex? What form could we write\\nthis original thing in order to pick out the vertex? Well, we're already\\na little familiar with completing the square. And when you complete the\\nsquare with this expression, that seems to be a pretty good\\nway of thinking about what the minimum value\\nof this function is. So let's just do\\nthat right over here. So I'm just going to rewrite it. So we get f of x is equal\\nto x squared minus 5x. And I'm just going to throw\\nthe plus 6 right over here. And I'm giving myself\\nsome real estate because what I need to do, what\\nI want to think about doing, is adding and subtracting\\nthe same value. So I'm going to add it here, and\\nI'm going to subtract it there. And I can do that because\\nthen I've just added 0. I haven't changed the value\\nof this right-hand side. But I want to do that so that\\nthis part that I've underlined in this magenta color, so that\\nthis part right over here, is a perfect square. And we've done\\nthis multiple times when we've completed the square. I encourage you to\\nwatch those videos if you need a little\\nbit of a review on it. But the general idea\\nis this is going to be a perfect\\nsquare if we take this coefficient\\nright over here. We take negative 5. We take 1/2 of that, which is\\nnegative 5/2, and we square it. So we could write this\\nas plus negative-- what's negative 5/2 squared? So I could write this--\\nnegative 5/2 squared. Well, if we square\\na negative number, it's just going\\nto be a positive. So it's going to be the\\nsame thing as 5/2 squared. 5 squared is 25. 2 squared is 4. So this is going\\nto be plus 25/4. Now, once again, if we want\\nthis equality to be true, we either have to add the\\nsame thing to both sides. Or if we're just\\noperating on one side, if we added it to that\\nside, we could just subtract it from that side. And we haven't changed the\\ntotal value on that side. So we added 25/4, and\\nwe subtracted 25/4. So what is this part\\nright over here? What does this become,\\nthe part that I've underlined in magenta? Well, this is going to\\nbe-- the whole reason why we engineered it in\\nthis way is so that this could be x minus 5/2 squared. And I encourage\\nyou to verify this. And we go into more\\ndetail about why taking 1/2 the coefficient here\\nand then squaring it, adding it there and then subtracting\\nthere, why that works. We do that in the completing\\nthe square videos. But these two things,\\nyou can verify that they are equivalent. So that's that part. And now we just have to\\nsimplify 6 minus 25/4. So 6 could be rewritten as 24/4. 24/4 minus 25/4 is negative 1/4,\\nso minus 1/4, just like that. So we've rewritten\\nour original function as f of x is equal to x\\nminus 5/2 squared minus 1/4. Now, why is this\\nform interesting? Well, one way to think\\nabout it is this part is always going to\\nbe non-negative. The minimum value of this part\\nin magenta is going to be 0. Why? Because we're\\nsquaring this thing. If you're taking\\nsomething like this-- and we're just dealing\\nwith real numbers-- and you're squaring\\nit, you're not going to be able to\\nget a negative value. At the minimum value,\\nthis is going to be 0. And then it obviously could\\nbe positive values, as well. So if we want to think about\\nwhen does this thing hit its minimum value-- well,\\nit hits its minimum value when you're squaring 0. And when are you squaring 0? Well, you're squaring 0 when\\nx minus 5/2 is equal to 0, or when x is equal\\nto 5/2 if you just want to add 5/2 to both\\nsides of that equation. So this thing hits its minimum\\nvalue when x is equal to 5/2. And then what is y, or what is\\nf of x, when x is equal to 5/2? f of 5/2-- and once again, you\\ncould use any of those forms to evaluate 5/2. But it's really\\neasy in this form. When x is equal to 5/2, this\\nterm right over here becomes 0. 0 squared, 0. You're just left\\nwith negative 1/4. So another way to think\\nabout it is our vertex is at the point x equals\\n5/2, y equals negative 1/4. So x equals 5/2. That's the same\\nthing as 2 and 1/2. So x equals 5/2. And y is equal to negative 1/4. So if that is negative 1, 1/4\\nwould be something like that. So that right over\\nthere is the vertex. That is the point--\\nlet me make it clear-- that's the point 5/2\\ncomma negative 1/4. And what's cool is we've\\njust used this form to figure out the minimum\\npoint, to figure out the vertex in this case. And then we can use the\\nroots as two other points to get a rough sketch of what\\nthis parabola will actually look like. So the interesting-- or I guess\\nthe takeaway from this video is just to realize that we can\\nrewrite this in different forms depending on what we're\\ntrying to understand about this function. \",\n",
       " '14.11.2': '- [Instructor] The function m is given in three equivalent forms. Which form most quickly\\nreveals the y-intercept? So let\\'s just remind ourselves. If I have a function, the graph y is equal to m of x. And these are all equivalent\\nforms, they tell us that. The function m is given\\nin three equivalent forms. I should be able to\\nalgebraically manipulate anyone of these to get\\nany of the other ones. And so, if I wanted to\\ngraph y is equal to m of x, and let\\'s say it looks\\nsomething like this. I actually know it\\'s a\\ndownward opening parabola, because I can look at\\nthis form right over here and say, \"Hey look, the coefficient \"on the second degree\\nterm here is a negative.\" So it\\'s going to be a\\ndownward opening parabola. That\\'s a messy drawing of it. And so if we\\'re talking\\nabout the y intercept, we\\'re saying, \"Hey where does\\nit intersect the y-axis?\" So what is the y value\\nwhen x is equal to zero? So it boils down to how quickly can we evaluate m of zero? What is m of x, when x is equal to zero? So how quickly can you evaluate m of zero? Well in this top one, I\\ncan substitute zero for x and so it\\'ll be negative two times negative three times negative nine. So it\\'s not too hard to figure out, but there\\'s going to be\\nsome calculation in my head. Similarly in the second choice, for x equals zero, I then\\nget negative six-squared, which is positive 36 times negative two, which is negative 72, and then I have to add\\nthat to positive 18. I can do that, but it\\'s a little bit of computation. But here for this last one, and this is known as standard form, if I say x equals zero\\nthat term disappears, that term disappears and\\nI\\'m just left with m of zero is equal to negative 54. So standard form, this is\\nstandard form right over here, was by far the easiest. So we know the y-intercept\\nis zero comma negative 54. Now one rule of caution. Sometimes you might look at\\nwhat is called, vertex form. And as we\\'ll see this is the easiest one where it is to identify the vertex. But when you see this\\nlittle plus 18 hanging out, it looks a lot like this negative 54 that was hanging out. And you say, \"Hey, when x equals zero, \"maybe I can just cross that out \"the same way that I\\ncross these terms out.\" And be very, very careful there, because if x equals zero, this whole thing does not equal zero. When x is equal to zero, as I just said, you have negative six-squared, which is 36 times negative two. This is equal to negative 72. So m of zero is definitely not 18. So be very, very careful. But we can see that the best choice is this one, standard form, not vertex form or factored form. Factored form, as you can imagine, is very good for figuring out the zeros. Let\\'s do another example. And actually this is the same m of x, but we\\'re going to ask something else. So it\\'s given in those same three forms. Which form most quickly\\nreveals the vertex? Well I just called this\\nvertex form before, but what\\'s valuable about the vertex form is you can really say, \"Okay, this is going to be, \"this is going to achieve its vertex \"when this thing over\\nhere is equal to zero.\" How do I know that? Well, once you get used to vertex form, it\\'ll just become a bit of second nature. But if this is a\\ndownward-opening parabola, the vertex is when you\\nhit that maximum point. And as you can see here, x minus six-squared is always\\ngoing to be non-negative. You multiply that times the negative two, it\\'s always going to be non-positive. It\\'s either going to be\\nzero or a negative value, so this is always going\\nto take away from this 18. And so if you want to find the vertex, the maximum point here, it would be the x value that\\nmakes this thing equal to zero. Because for any other x value, this thing is going to be negative, it\\'s going to take away from that 18. And so you can see by inspection, well what x value will\\nmake this equal to zero? Well if x is equal to six, six minus six is equal to zero, zero-squared is zero, times negative two is zero. And so m of six is equal to 18. So this lets us know very quickly that the vertex is going to\\nhappen at x is equal to six and then the y value there or the m of six is going to be equal to 18. You can do it with these other ones. The hardest one would be standard form. Standard form you could\\ncomplete the square or do some other techniques or you could try to\\nget into factored form. Factored form you can find the zeros and then you\\'d know that the\\nx-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinate\\nof our two x-intercepts and then you could figure\\nout the y value there. But this one is definitely the easiest. The vertex form and what is the vertex? Well it\\'s going to happen\\nat the point six comma 18. Let\\'s do one last example. So this is a different function. The function f is given\\nin three equivalent forms, which form most quickly reveals the zeros or roots of the function? So once again, when we\\'re talking about zeros or roots, if we have, let\\'s say that\\'s the x axis and if you have a parabola\\nthat looks like that, the roots are, or the\\nzeros are the x values that make that function equal to zero. Or they\\'re the x values\\nof the x-intercepts, you could say. And so what x values make or which one is easy to figure out when this function is equal to zero? Which of these forms, because\\nthey\\'re all equivalent. You can expand out these first two and you should get this\\nlast one in standard form. Which one is easy to identify the zeros? Well in factored form, I could just say, \"Well, what makes either this thing zero \"or that thing zero?\" Because an x that makes\\nthis first one zero or the second one zero is going to make this\\nwhole expression zero. So you can quickly say, \"Well if x is equal to negative one, \"this is going to be zero. \"Or if x is equal to negative 11, \"this is going to be zero.\" So this is a very fast\\nway to find out the zeros. This one here, a lot harder. You would have to solve three\\ntimes x plus six-squared minus 75 is equal to zero. Do some algebraic manipulation and you would eventually\\nget to these answers. So I would rule the vertex\\nform right over here. And this form, standard form, the first step I would do, is try to get it into factored form. And then from factored form,\\nI would find the zeros. So once again, this is\\ndefinitely more work than if you already have\\nit in factored form. So factored form is\\ndefinitely what you want when you\\'re trying to find the zeros. And here it says write one of the zeros, I could write x equals negative one or I could have written\\nx equals negative 11. ',\n",
       " '14.11.3': \"We need to find the vertex\\nand the axis of symmetry of this graph. The whole point of doing this\\nproblem is so that you understand what the vertex\\nand axis of symmetry is. And just as a bit of a\\nrefresher, if a parabola looks like this, the vertex is the\\nlowest point here, so this minimum point here, for an\\nupward opening parabola. If the parabola opens downward\\nlike this, the vertex is the topmost point right like that. It's the maximum point. And the axis of symmetry is\\nthe line that you could reflect the parabola around,\\nand it's symmetric. So that's the axis\\nof symmetry. That is a reflection of the\\nleft-hand side along that axis of symmetry. Same thing if it's a\\ndownward-opening parabola. And the general way of telling\\nthe difference between an upward-opening and a\\ndownward-opening parabola is that this will have a positive\\ncoefficient on the x squared term, and this will have\\na negative coefficient. And we'll see that in a little\\nbit more detail. So let's just work on this. Now, in order to figure out the\\nvertex, there's a quick and dirty formula, but I'm not\\ngoing to do the formula here because the formula really tells\\nyou nothing about how you got it. But I'll show you how to apply\\nthe formula at the end of this video, if you see this on a math\\ntest and just want to do it really quickly. But we're going to do it the\\nslow, intuitive way first. So let's think about how we can\\nfind either the maximum or the minimum point of\\nthis parabola. So the best way I can think\\nof doing it is to complete the square. And it might seem like a very\\nforeign concept right now, but let's just do it one\\nstep at a time. So I can rewrite this as y is\\nequal to-- well, I can factor out a negative 2. It's equal to negative 2 times\\nx squared minus 4x minus 4. And I'm going to put the\\nminus 4 out here. And this is where I'm going\\nto complete the square. Now, what I want to do is\\nexpress the stuff in the parentheses as a sum of a\\nperfect square and then some number over here. And I have x squared minus 4x. If I wanted this to be a perfect\\nsquare, it would be a perfect square if I had a\\npositive 4 over here. If I had a positive 4 over\\nthere, then this would be a perfect square. It would be x minus 2 squared. And I got the 4, because I said,\\nwell, I want whatever half of this number is,\\nso half of negative 4 is negative 2. Let me square it. That'll give me a positive\\n4 right there. But I can't just add\\na 4 willy-nilly to one side of an equation. I either have to add it to the\\nother side or I would have to then just subtract it. So here I haven't changed\\nequation. I added 4 and then\\nI subtracted 4. I just added zero to this little\\nexpression here, so it didn't change it. But what it does allow me to do\\nis express this part right here as a perfect square. x\\nsquared minus 4x plus 4 is x minus 2 squared. It is x minus 2 squared. And then you have this\\nnegative 2 out front multiplying everything, and\\nthen you have a negative 4 minus negative 4, minus\\n8, just like that. So you have y is equal to\\nnegative 2 times this entire thing, and now we can multiply\\nout the negative 2 again. So we can distribute it. Y is equal to negative 2 times\\nx minus 2 squared. And then negative 2 times\\nnegative 8 is plus 16. Now, all I did is algebraically arrange this equation. But what this allows us to do\\nis think about what the maximum or minimum point\\nof this equation is. So let's just explore\\nthis a little bit. This quantity right here, x\\nminus 2 squared, if you're squaring anything, this\\nis always going to be a positive quantity. That right there is\\nalways positive. But it's being multiplied\\nby a negative number. So if you look at the larger\\ncontext, if you look at the always positive multiplied by\\nthe negative 2, that's going to be always negative. And the more positive that this\\nnumber becomes when you multiply it by a negative, the\\nmore negative this entire expression becomes. So if you think about it,\\nthis is going to be a downward-opening parabola. We have a negative coefficient\\nout here. And the maximum point on this\\ndownward-opening parabola is when this expression right here\\nis as small as possible. If this gets any larger, it's\\njust multiplied by a negative number, and then you subtract\\nit from 16. So if this expression right here\\nis 0, then we have our maximum y value, which is 16. So how do we get x is\\nequal to 0 here? Well, the way to get x minus\\n2 equal to 0-- so let's just do it. x minus 2 is equal to 0,\\nso that happens when x is equal to 2. So when x is equal to 2,\\nthis expression is 0. 0 times a negative number,\\nit's all 0, and then y is equal to 16. This is our vertex, this\\nis our maximum point. We just reasoned through it,\\njust looking at the algebra, that the highest value this\\ncan take on is 16. As x moves away from 2 in\\nthe positive or negative direction, this quantity right\\nhere, it might be negative or positive, but when you square\\nit, it's going to be positive. And when you multiply it by\\nnegative 2, it's going to become negative and it's going\\nto subtract from 16. So our vertex right here\\nis x is equal to 2. Actually, let's say each\\nof these units are 2. So this is 2, 4, 6,\\n8, 10, 12, 14, 16. So my vertex is here. That is the absolute maximum\\npoint for this parabola. And its axis of symmetry is\\ngoing to be along the line x is equal to 2, along the\\nvertical line x is equal to 2. That is going to be its\\naxis of symmetry. And now if we're just curious\\nfor a couple of other points, just because we want to plot\\nthis thing, we could say, well, what happens when\\nx is equal to 0? That's an easy one. When x is equal to 0,\\ny is equal to 8. So when x is equal to 0, we have\\n1, 2, 3, 4-- oh, well, these are 2. 2, 4, 6, 8. It's right there. This is an axis of symmetry. So when x is equal to 3, y is\\nalso going to be equal to 8. So this parabola is a really\\nsteep and narrow one that looks something like this, where\\nthis right here is the maximum point. Now I told you this is the slow\\nand intuitive way to do the problem. If you wanted a quick and dirty\\nway to figure out a vertex, there is a formula\\nthat you can derive it actually, doing this exact same\\nprocess we just did, but the formula for the vertex, or\\nthe x-value of the vertex, or the axis of symmetry, is x is\\nequal to negative b over 2a. So if we just apply this-- but,\\nyou know, this is just kind of mindless application\\nof a formula. I wanted to show you the\\nintuition why this formula even exists. But if you just mindlessly\\napply this, you'll get-- what's b here? So x is equal to negative--\\nb here is 8. 8 over 2 times a. a right here is a negative 2. 2 times negative 2. So what is that going\\nto be equal to? It is negative 8 over negative\\n4, which is equal to 2, which is the exact same thing we\\ngot by reasoning it out. And when x is equal to\\n2, y is equal to 16. Same exact result there. That's the point 2 comma 16. \",\n",
       " '14.11.4': \"- [Voiceover] So, I have three\\ndifferent functions here. I know they're all called f, but we're gonna just assume\\nthey are different functions. And, for each of these, I\\nwant to do three things. I want to find the zeros. And so, the zeros are the input values that make the value of the\\nfunction equal to zero. So, here it'd be the t values\\nthat make f of t equal zero. Here, it'd be the x values that make the function equal zero. So, I want to find the zeros. I also want to find the\\ncoordinates of the vertex. And finally, I want to find the equation of the line of symmetry. Line of symmetry. And in particular, to make it\\na little bit more specific, the vertical line of symmetry,\\nwhich will actually be the only line of symmetry for these three. So, pause the video and\\nsee if you can figure out the zeros, the vertex,\\nand the line of symmetry. And I'm assuming you just did that and now I am going to attempt to do it. And if, at any point, you get inspired pause the video again and\\nkeep on working on it. The best way to learn this\\nstuff is to do it yourself. So, let's see, so let's\\nfirst find the zeros. So, to find the zeros, we can set t minus five squared,\\nminus nine, equal to zero. So, we could say t ... for what t's does t minus five squared,\\nminus nine, equal zero? Let's see, to solve this, we\\ncould add nine to both sides. And so we could say, if\\nwe add nine to both sides the lefthand side's just\\nt minus five squared. The righthand side is going to be nine. And so, if t minus five squared\\nis nine, that means that t minus five could be equal to the positive square root of nine or t minus five could equal the negative square root of nine. And to solve for t, we could\\nadd five to both sides, so we get t is equal to\\neight or t is equal to, if we add five to both sides here, t is equal to two. And just like that, we\\nhave found the zeros for this function because if\\nt is equal to eight or two, the function is going to be zero. F of eight is zero and f\\nof two is going to be zero. Now, let's find the vertex,\\nthe coordinates of the vertex. The coordinates of the vertex. So, the x coordinate of the vertex, or sorry, I should say the\\nt coordinate of the vertex since the input variable here is t, the t coordinate of the\\nvertex is going to be halfway in between the zeros. It's going to be halfway in between where the parabola, in this case, is going to intersect the x axis, or the t axis, I keep saying x axis, the t axis for this case. So, halfway between eight and two. Well, it's gonna be the average of them. Eight plus two, over two. That's ten over two, that's five. The t coordinate is five and five is three away from eight\\nand three away from two. And, when t is equal to\\nfive, what is f of t? What is f of five? Well, when t is equal to five, five minus five squared is just zero. And then, f of five is just\\ngoing to be negative nine. And this form of a function,\\nthis is actually called vertex form because it's very\\neasy to pick out the vertex. It's very easy to\\nrealize, like, okay look, for this particular one, we're\\ngoing to hit a minimum point when this part of the\\nexpression is equal to zero because this thing, the\\nlowest value it can take on is zero cause you're squaring it, it can never take on a negative value. And it takes on zero\\nwhen t is equal to five. And when that's, if this part is zero, then the f of five is\\ngoing to be negative nine. So, just like that, we have\\nestablished the vertex. Now, we actually have a lot of information if we wanted to draw it. So, if we want to draw this function. I'll just do a very quick sketch of it. Whoops. So, a very quick sketch of it. So, that is our t axis, not our x axis, I have to keep reminding myself. And that is my, let's call that my y axis. And we're going to graph\\ny is equal to f of t. Well, we know the vertex is at the point five comma negative nine. So, this is, t is equal to five and y is equal to negative nine, so that's the vertex right over there. And then, we know we have zeros at t equals eight and t equals two. So, t equals eight and t equals two. Let me make that a little\\nbit in, t equals two. Those are the two zeros. So, eight and two. And so, just like that,\\nwe can graph f of t, or we can graph y is equal to f of t. So, y is equal to f of t is\\ngoing to look something like let me draw it a little\\n... something like that That's the graph of y is equal to f of t. Now, the last thing that I\\nsaid is the line of symmetry. Well, the line of symmetry is going to be the vertical line that\\ngoes through the vertex. So, the equation of that line of symmetry is going to be t is equal to five. That's really just the t\\ncoordinate of the vertex. That defines the line of symmetry. Let's do the other two right over here. So, what are the zeros? Well, if you set this equal\\nto zero, if we say x plus two times x plus four is equal to zero, well that's going to happen\\nif x plus two is equal to zero or x plus four is equal to zero. This is going to happen if we\\nsubtract two from both sides, when x is negative two,\\nand if we subtract four from both sides, or when x\\nis equal to negative four. As we said, the vertex, the\\nx coordinate of the vertex, is going to be halfway in between these. So, it's going to be negative\\ntwo plus negative four, over two, so that would\\nbe negative six, over two, which is just negative three. Negative three. And when x is negative\\nthree, f of x is going to be, let's see, it's going to be negative one times one, right? Negative three plus two is\\nnegative one, and so times one. So, it's just going to be negative one. There you have it. And the line of symmetry is\\ngoing to be the vertical line x is equal to negative three. And once again, we can\\ngraph that really fast. So, let me, this is my y axis. See everything is\\nhappening for negative x's, so I'll draw it a little\\nbit more skewed this way. This is my x axis. And we see that we have zeros\\nat x equals negative two and x is equal to negative four. So, negative one, two, three, four. So, we have zeros there, negative two, be careful. Negative two and negative four. And the vertex is at negative\\nthree comma negaitve one. So, negative three comma negative one. Make sure we see that, so this is negative one right over\\nhere, negative one. This is negative two,\\nthis is negative four. And so we can sketch out what the graph of y is equal to f of x\\nis going to look like. It's gonna look something like that. That is y is equal to f of x. Let's do one more. Hopefully, we're getting the hang of this. So, here, to solve x squared,\\nplus six x, plus eight is equal to zero, it will\\nbe useful to factor this. And so, this can be written as, and if you have trouble doing this,\\nI encourage you to watch videos on factoring polynomials, What adds up to six and when you take their product is eight? Well, four and two. Four plus two is six and\\nfour times two is eight. So, is equal to zero. And then, this is actually\\nthe exact same thing as what we have in blue right over here. These are actually the\\nexact same function. They're just written in different forms. And so, the solutions are\\ngonna be the exact solutions that we just saw right\\nover here and the graph is going to be the same thing\\nthat we have right over there. So, same vertex, same line\\nof symmetry, same zeros. These functions were just\\nwritten in different ways. \",\n",
       " '14.11.5': \"- [Instructor] We're\\ntold that Rodrigo watches a helicopter take off from a platform. The height of the helicopter,\\nin meters above the ground, t minutes after takeoff is modeled by, and we see this function right over here. Rodrigo wants to know when the helicopter will land on the ground. So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. All right, now let's\\nthink about this together. So let's just imagine\\nactually what the graph of this function looks like. And it'll also help us\\nimagine what's going on with the helicopter. So our horizontal axis,\\nthis is t, time in minutes, and then our vertical axis is height. So height as a function of time. And maybe I just write it like this. I'll just write height, and this is given in\\nmeters above the ground. Now I don't know exactly\\nwhat the graph looks like, but given that I have\\na negative coefficient on my quadratic term, I know that it is a downward\\nopening parabola like that. And it says that the helicopter\\ntakes off of a platform. So however high the platform is, then it takes off and it's\\ngoing to do something like this. I don't know exactly what\\nthe graph looks like, but probably something like this. Now, if they asked us\\nwhat is the highest point of the helicopter, and at\\nwhat time does it happen, then we'd wanna figure\\nout what the vertex is of this parabola. But that's not what they're asking. They're asking when does the\\nhelicopter land on the ground? That's this time right over here. So if we wanted to find the vertex, we would wanna put this into vertex form, but here we wanna figure out when does that function equal zero. We want to find a zero of this\\nquadratic right over here. So the best way that I\\ncan think about doing it is try to factor it, try to set them this thing equal to zero, and then factor it and\\nthen see what t values make that equal to zero. So let me do that. So I say negative three t\\nsquared plus 24t plus 60, remember we care when our height is equal to zero, equal zero. So let's see maybe the\\nfirst thing I would do just to simplify the second\\ndegree term a little bit. Let's just divide both\\nsides by negative three. If we did that, this would become t squared\\n24 divided by negative three is negative eight, negative eight t. 60 divided by negative\\nthree is negative 20, and then zero divided by negative three is of course still zero. And now can I think of\\ntwo numbers whose product is negative 20? So they would have different signs in order to get a negative product, and who sum is negative eight. So let's see what about\\nnegative 10 and two, and that scene seems to work. So I could write this as t\\nminus 10, times t plus two is equal to zero. And so in order to make\\nthis expression equals zero, either one of these\\ncould be equal to zero. So either t minus 10 is equal to zero, or t plus two is equal to zero. And of course on the left here, I can add 10 to both sides. So either t equals 10, or I could subtract two\\nfrom both sides here, t is equal to negative two. So there's two places where the function is equal to zero. One at time t equals negative two, and one at time t is equal to 10. Now we're assuming we're\\ndealing with positive time here. We don't know what the\\nhelicopter was doing before the takeoff. So we wouldn't really think about this. So what we really care about is that t is equal to 10 minutes. That's when the helicopter\\nis right over there. And actually we know at t equals zero, these two terms become zero. We know it takes off at 60 meters. It goes up. If we figured out the vertex, we would know how high it went, but then it starts going back down, and in 10 minutes after takeoff, it is back at zero, back on the ground. \",\n",
       " '14.11.6': \"- [Instructor] We're told that\\nTaylor opened a restaurant. The net value of the restaurant\\nin thousands of dollars, t months after its opening is modeled by v of t is equal to\\ntwo t squared minus 20t. Taylor wants to know what the restaurant's\\nlowest net value will be, underline that, and when\\nit will reach that value. So let's break it down step by step. The function which describes how the value of the restaurant, the net value of the restaurant, changes over time is right over here. If I were to graph it, I\\ncan see that the coefficient on the quadratic term is positive, so it's going to be some form\\nof upward-opening parabola. I don't know exactly what it looks like, we can think about that in a second. And so it's going to have\\nsome point, right over here, which really is the\\nvertex of this parabola, where it's going to hit\\nits lowest in that value, and that's going to happen at some time t, if you can imagine that this\\nright over here is the t-axis. So my first question\\nis, is there some form, is there some way that I can re-write this function algebraically\\nso it becomes very easy to pick out this low point, which is essentially the\\nvertex of this parabola? Pause this video and think about that. All right, so you can imagine the form that I'm talking about is vertex form, where you can clearly spot the vertex. And the way we can do that is actually by completing the square. So the first thing I will do is, actually let me factor out a two here, because two is a common\\nfactor of both of these terms. So v of t would be equal to\\ntwo times t squared minus 10t. And I'm going to leave some space, because completing the square,\\nwhich gets us to vertex form, is all about adding and subtracting the same value on one side. So we're not actually changing\\nthe value of that side, but writing it in a way so we have a perfect square expression, and then we're probably going to add or subtract some value out here. Now how do we make this a\\nperfect square expression? If any of this business about completing the square\\nlooks unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to look\\nup completing the square on Khan Academy and review that. But the way that we complete the square is we look at this first degree\\ncoefficient right over here, it's negative 10, and we say all right, well let's take half\\nof that and square it. So half of negative 10 is negative five, and if we were to square it, that's 25. So if we add 25 right over here, then this is going to become\\na perfect square expression. And you can see that\\nit would be equivalent to this entire thing,\\nif we add 25 like that, is going to be equivalent\\nto t minus five squared, just this part right over here. That's why we took half\\nof this and we squared it. But as I alluded to a few seconds\\nago, or a few minutes ago, you can't just willy\\nnilly add 25 to one side of an equation like this, that will make this\\nequality no longer true. And in fact we didn't just add 25. Remember we have this two out\\nhere, we added two times 25. You can verify that if\\nyou redistribute the two, you'd get two t squared minus 20t plus 50, plus two times 25. So in order to make the equality, or in order to allow it\\nto continue to be true, we have to subtract 50. So just to be clear, this isn't some kind of\\nstrange thing I'm doing, all I did was add 50 and subtract 50. You're saying wait, you added 25, not 50. No look, when I added 25\\nhere, it's in a parenthesis, and then the whole expression\\nis multiplied by two, so I really did add 50 here,\\nso then I subtract 50 here to get to what I originally had. And when you view it that way, now v of t is going to be equal\\nto two times this business, which we already established\\nis t minus five squared, and then we have the minus 50. Now why is this form useful? This is vertex form, it's very\\neasy to pick out the vertex. It's very easy to pick\\nout when the low point is. The low point here happens\\nwhen this part is minimized. And this part is\\nminimized, think about it, you have two times something squared. So if you have something squared, it's going to hit its lowest point when this something is zero, otherwise it's going\\nto be a positive value. And so this part right over here is going to be equal to zero\\nwhen t is equal to five. So the lowest value is\\nwhen t is equal to five. Let me do that in a different color, don't wanna reuse the colors too much. So if we say v of five is going to be equal to two times five minus five, trying to keep up with the colors, minus five squared minus 50. Notice this whole thing\\nbecomes zero right over here. So v of five is equal to negative 50, that is when we hit our low point, in terms of the net\\nvalue of the restaurant. So t represents months,\\nso we hit our low point, we rewrote our function\\nin a form, in vertex form, so it's easy to pick out this value, and we see that this low point\\nhappens at t equals five, which is at time five months. And then what is that lowest net value? Well it's negative 50. And remember, the function\\ngives us the net value in thousands of dollars,\\nso it's negative $50,000 is the lowest net value of the restaurant. And you might say how do you have a negative value of something, well imagine if, say the\\nbuilding is worth $50,000, but the restaurant owes $100,000, then it would have a\\nnegative $50,000 net value. \",\n",
       " '14.12.1': '- [Voiceover] So we\\'re\\nasked which function has the greater y-intercept? So, the y-intercept is the y-coordinate when x is equal to zero. So, f of zero, when x is equal to zero, the function is equal to, let\\'s see, f of zero is going to be equal to zero minus zero, plus four,\\nis going to be equal to four. So this function right over here, it has a y-intercept of four. So it would intersect the\\ny-axis right over there. While the function that\\nwe\\'re comparing it to, g of x, we\\'re looking at its graph, y is equal to g of x, its y-intercept is right over here, at y is equal to three. So which function has\\na greater y-intercept? Well, it\\'s going to be f of x. F of x has a greater\\ny-intercept than g of x does. Let\\'s do a few more of these where we\\'re comparing different functions. One of them that has a visual depiction, and one of them where we\\'re\\njust given the equation. How many roots do the\\nfunctions have in common? Well, g of x, we can see their roots. The roots are, x equals negative one and x is equal to two. So these two functions, at most, are going to have two roots in common, because this g of x only has two roots. There\\'s a couple of\\nways we could tackle it. We could just try to find f\\'s roots, or we could plug in\\neither one of these values and see if it makes the\\nfunction equal to a zero. I\\'ll do the first way,\\nI\\'ll try to factor this. So let\\'s see, what two numbers,\\nif I add them I get one, \\'cause that\\'s the coefficient\\nhere, or implicitly there. And if I take the product,\\nI get negative six. Well, their gonna have\\nto have different signs since their product is negative. So, let\\'s see, negative\\nthree and positive two. No, actually, the other way\\naround \\'cause it\\'s positive one. So positive three, and negative two. So this is equal to x plus\\nthree, times x minus two. So f of x is going to have zeros when x is equal to negative three. X is equal to negative three. Or, x is equal to two. These are the two zeros. If x is equal to negative three, this expression becomes zero. Zero times anything is zero. If x equals two, this\\nexpression becomes zero, and zero times anything is zero. So f of negative three is\\nzero, and f of two is zero. These are the zeros of that function. So let\\'s see, which of\\nthese are in common? Well, negative three is out\\nhere, that\\'s not in common. X equals two is in common, so they only have one common\\nzero right over there. So how many roots do the\\nfunctions have in common? One. All right. Let\\'s do one more of these. And they ask us, \"Do the functions\\nhave the same concavity?\" And one way to think about concavity is whether it\\'s opening upwards\\nor opening downwards. So this is often viewed\\nas concave upwards, and this is viewed as concave downwards. Concave downwards. And the key realization is, well, if you just look at this\\nblue, if you look at g of x right over here, it is concave downwards. So the question is, \"Would this be concave \"downwards or upwards?\" And the key here is the coefficient on the second degree term,\\non the x squared term. If the coefficient is positive, you\\'re going to be concave upwards, because as x gets suitably\\nfar away from zero, this term is going to\\noverpower everything else, and it\\'s going to become positive. So as x gets further and further away, we\\'re not even further away from zero, as x gets further and\\nfurther away from the vertex, as x gets further and\\nfurther away from the vertex, this term dominates everything else, and we get more and more positive values. And so that\\'s why if your\\ncoefficient is positive, you\\'re going to have concave upwards, a concave upwards graph. And so if this is concave upwards, this one is clearly concave downwards. They do not have the\\nsame concavity, so no. If this was negative\\nfour x squared minus 108, then it would be concave\\ndownwards and we would say yes. Anyway, hopefully you\\nfound that interesting. ',\n",
       " '14.12.2': \"Which quadratic has the\\nlowest maximum value? So let's figure out the maximum\\nvalue for each of these-- and they're defined\\nin different ways-- and then see which\\none is the lowest. And I'll start with the easiest. So h of x. We can just graphically look\\nat it, visually look at it, and say-- what's\\nthe maximum point? And the maximum point looks\\nlike it's right over here when x is equal to 4. And when x is equal to 4, y or\\nh of x is equal to negative 1. So the maximum for h of x\\nlooks like it is negative 1. Now, what's the\\nmaximum for g of x? And they've given us some\\npoints here and here. Once again, we can just\\neyeball it, and say-- well, what's the maximum\\nvalue they gave us? Well, 5 is the largest value. It happens when x is\\nequal to 0. g of 0 is 5. So the maximum value here is 5. Now, f of x. They just give us an\\nexpression to define it. And so it's going take\\na little bit of work to figure out what\\nthe maximum value is. The easiest way to do\\nthat for a quadratic is to complete the square. And so let's do it. So we have f of x is equal\\nto negative x squared plus 6x minus 1. I never like having\\nthis negative here. So I'm going to factor it out. This is the same thing\\nas negative times x squared minus 6x and plus 1. And I'm going to write\\nthe plus 1 out here because I'm fixing to\\ncomplete the square. Now, just as a review of\\ncompleting the square, we essentially want to add\\nand subtract the same number so that part of this\\nexpression is a perfect square. And to figure out what number\\nwe want to add and subtract, we look at the\\ncoefficient on the x term. It's a negative 6. You take half of that. That's negative 3. And you square it. Negative 3 squared is 9. Now, we can't just add a 9. That would change the actual\\nvalue of the expression. We have to add a 9\\nand subtract a 9. And you might say-- well, why\\nare we adding and subtracting the same thing if\\nit doesn't change the value of the expression? And the whole\\npoint is so that we can get this first\\npart of the expression to represent a perfect square. This x squared minus 6x\\nplus 9 is x minus 3 squared. So I can rewrite that\\npart as x minus 3 squared and then minus 9--\\nor negative 9-- plus 1 is negative 8. Let me do that in\\na different color so we can keep track of things. So this part right over\\nhere is negative 8. And we still have the\\nnegative out front. And so we can rewrite\\nthis as-- if we distribute the negative sign-- negative\\nx minus 3 squared plus 8. Now, let's think about\\nwhat the maximum value is. And to understand\\nthe maximum value, we have to interpret this\\nnegative x minus 3 squared. Well, x minus 3 squared-- before\\nwe think about the negative-- that is always going\\nto be a positive value. Or it's always going\\nto be non-negative. But then, when we\\nmake it negative, it's always going\\nto be non-positive. Think about it. If x is equal to 3, this\\nthing is going to be 0. And you take the negative\\nof that, it's going to be 0. x is anything else,\\nx is anything other than 3, this part\\nof the expression is going to be positive. But then, you have a minus sign. So you're going to subtract\\nthat positive value from 8. So this actually\\nhas a maximum value when this first term\\nright over here is 0. The only thing that this part\\nof the expression could do is subtract from the 8. If you want to get\\na maximum value, this should be equal to 0. This equals 0 when\\nx is equal to 3. When x is equal to 3, this is 0. And our function hits\\nits maximum value of 8. So this has a max-- let\\nme do that in a color that you can actually read--\\nthis has a max value of 8. So which has the\\nlowest maximum value? h of x. \",\n",
       " '14.13.1': \"Here I've drawn the\\nmost classic parabola, y is equal to x squared. And what I want to do is think\\nabout what happens-- or how can I go about shifting\\nthis parabola. And so let's think about\\na couple of examples. So let's think about\\nthe graph of the curve. This is y is equal to x squared. Let's think about what\\nthe curve of y minus k is equal to x squared. What would this look like? Well, right over here, we\\nsee when x is equal to 0, x squared is equal to 0. That's this yellow curve. So x squared is equal to y,\\nor y is equal to x squared. But for this one, x\\nsquared isn't equal to y. It's equal to y minus k. So when x equals a\\n0, and we square it, 0 squared doesn't get us to y. It gets us to y minus k. So this is going to\\nbe k less than y. Or another way of thinking\\nabout it, this is 0. If it's k less than y, y must\\nbe at k, wherever k might be. So y must be at k,\\nright over there. So at least for this\\npoint, it had the effect of shifting up the y value by k. And that's actually true\\nfor any of these values. So let's think about x\\nbeing right over here. For this yellow curve,\\nyou square this x value, and you get it there. And it's clearly not\\ndrawn to scale the way that I've done it\\nright over here. But now for this\\ncurve right over here, x squared doesn't cut it. It only gets you to y minus k. So y must be k higher than this. So this is y minus k. y\\nmust be k higher than this. So y must be right over here. So this curve is essentially\\nthis blue curve shifted up by k. So making it y minus k is equal\\nto x squared shifted it up by k. Whatever value this\\nis, shift it up by k. This distance is a constant\\nk, the vertical distance between these two parabolas. And I'll try to draw\\nit as cleanly as I can. This vertical distance\\nis a constant k. Now let's think about shifting\\nin the horizontal direction. Let's think about what happens\\nif I were to say y is equal to, not x squared, but\\nx minus h squared. So let's think about it. This is the value you would get\\nfor y when you just square 0. You get y is equal to 0. How do we get y\\nequals 0 over here? Well, this quantity right\\nover here has to be 0. So x minus h has to be 0,\\nor x has to be equal to h. So let's say that h\\nis right over here. So x has to be equal to h. So one way to think about\\nit is, whatever value you were squaring here\\nto get your y, you now have to have\\nan h higher value to square that same thing. Because you're going\\nto subtract h from it. Just to get to 0,\\nx has to equal h. Here, if you wanted to square\\n1, x just had to be equal to 1. So here, let's just say,\\nfor the sake of argument, that this is x is equal to 1. And this is 1 squared,\\nclearly not drawn to scale. So that would be 1, as well. But now to square 1, we don't\\nhave to just get x equals 1. x has to be h plus 1. It has to be 1 higher than h. It has to be h plus 1 to\\nget to that same point. So you see the net\\neffect is that instead of squaring just x,\\nbut squaring x minus h, we shifted the\\ncurve to the right. So the curve-- let me do this in\\nthis purple color, this magenta color-- will look like this. We shifted it to the right. And we shifted it\\nto the right by h. Now let's think of another\\nthought experiment. Let's imagine that-- let's\\nthink about the curve y is equal to\\nnegative x squared. Well, now whatever the\\nvalue of x squared is, we're going to take\\nthe negative of it. So here, no matter what\\nx we took, we squared it. We get a positive value. Now we're always going\\nto get a negative value once we multiply it\\ntimes a negative 1. So it's going to look like this. It's going to be a\\nmirror image of y equals x squared reflected\\nover the horizontal axis. So it's going to look\\nsomething like that. So that's y is equal\\nto negative x squared. And now let's just imagine\\nscaling it even more. What would y equal\\nnegative 2x squared? Well, actually, let\\nme do two things. So what would y equals\\n2x squared look like? So let's just take\\nthe positive version, so y equals 2x squared. Well, now as we\\nsquare things, we're going to multiply them by 2. So it's going to\\nincrease faster. So it's going to look\\nsomething like this. It's going to be\\nnarrower and steeper. So it might look\\nsomething like this. And once again, I'm just\\ngiving you the idea. I haven't really\\ndrawn this to scale. So increasing it by a factor\\nwill make it increase faster. If we did y equals\\nnegative 2x squared, well, then it's going to get\\nnegative faster on either side. So it's going to look\\nsomething like this. It's going to be the mirror\\nimage of what I just drew. So it's going to be a narrower\\nparabola just like that. And similarly-- and I know that\\nmy diagram is getting really messy right now--\\nbut just remember we started with y\\nequals x squared, which is this curve\\nright over here. What happens if we did\\ny equals 1/2 x squared? I'm running out of\\ncolors, as well. If we did y equals\\n1/2 x squared, well, then the thing's\\ngoing to increase slower. It's going to look the same,\\nbut it's going to open up wider. It's going to increase slower. It's going to look\\nsomething like this. So this hopefully\\ngives you a sense of how we can shift\\nparabolas around. So for example, if I have-- and\\nI'm doing a very rough drawing here to give you the\\ngeneral idea of what we're talking about. So if this is y\\nequals x squared, so that's the graph\\nof y equals x squared. Let me do this in a color\\nthat I haven't used yet-- the graph of y minus k is equal\\nto A times x minus h squared will look something like this. Instead of the vertex\\nbeing at 0, 0, the vertex-- or the lowest, or\\nI guess you could say the minimum or\\nthe maximum point, the extreme point in the\\nparabola, this point right over here, would be the maximum\\npoint for a downward opening parabola, a minimum point for\\nan upward opening parabola-- that's going to be shifted. It's going to be shifted\\nby h to the right and k up. So its vertex is going\\nto be right over here. And it's going to be scaled\\nby A. So if A is equal to 1, it's going to look the same. It's going to have\\nthe same opening. So that's A equals 1. If A is greater than 1, it's\\ngoing to be steeper, like this. If A is less than 1\\nbut greater than 0, it's just going to be\\nwider opening, like that. Actually, if A is 0, then it\\njust turns into a flat line. And then if A is negative\\nbut less than negative 1, it's kind of a broad-opening\\nthing like that. Or I should say greater\\nthan negative 1. If it's between\\n0 and negative 1, it will be a broad-opening\\nthing like that. At negative 1, it'll\\nlook like a reflection of our original curve. And then if A is less\\nthan negative 1-- so it's even more\\nnegative-- then it's going to be even a\\nsteeper parabola that might look like that. So hopefully that\\ngives you a good way of how to shift and\\nscale parabolas. \",\n",
       " '14.13.2': \"- [Instructor] Function g can\\nbe thought of as a translated or shifted version of f of\\nx is equal to x squared. Write the equation for g of x. Now, pause this video, and see if you can work\\nthis out on your own. All right, so whenever I think\\nabout shifting a function, and in this case, we're\\nshifting a parabola, I like to look for a distinctive point. And on a parabola, the vertex is going to be our most distinctive point. And if I focus on the vertex of f, it looks like if I shift that to the right by three, and then if I were to shift that down by four, at least our vertices would overlap. I would be able to shift the vertex to where the vertex of g is. And it does look, and we'll validate this, at\\nleast visually, in a little bit, so I'm gonna go minus four\\nin the vertical direction, that not only would it\\nmake the vertices overlap, but it would make the\\nentire curve overlap. So we're going to make,\\nwe're gonna first shift to the right by three. And we're gonna think about how\\nwould we change our equation so it shifts f to the right by three, and then we're gonna shift down by four. Shift down by four. Now, some of you might\\nalready be familiar with this, and I go into the intuition in a lot more depth in other videos. But in general, when you shift to the right by some value, in this case, we're shifting\\nto the right by three, you would replace x with x minus three. So one way to think about this\\nwould be y is equal to f of x minus three, or y is equal to, instead\\nof it being x squared, you would replace x with x minus three. So it'd be x minus three squared. Now, when I first learned this,\\nthis was counterintuitive. I'm shifting to the right by three. The x-coordinate of my vertex\\nis increasing by three, but I'm replacing x with x minus three. Why does this make sense? Well, let's graph the shifted version, just to get a little\\nbit more intuition here. Once again, I go into much more\\ndepth in other videos here. This is more of a worked example. So this is what the shifted\\ncurve is gonna look like. Think about the behavior that we want, right over here, at x equals three. We want the same value\\nthat we used to have when x equals zero. When x equals zero for the original f, zero squared was zero. Y equals zero. We still want y equals zero. Well, the way that we can do that is if we are squaring zero, and the way that we're gonna square zero is if we subtract three from x. And you can validate that at other points. Think about what happens\\nnow, when x equals four. Four minus three is one squared. It does indeed equal one. The same behavior that you used to get at x is equal to one. So it does look like we have\\nindeed shifted to the right by three when we replace\\nx with x minus three. If you replaced x with x plus three, it would have had the opposite effect. You would have shifted\\nto the left by three, and I encourage to think about why that actually makes sense. So now that we've shifted\\nto the right by three, the next step is to shift down by four, and this one is little bit more intuitive. So let's start with our\\nshifted to the right. So that's y is equal to\\nx minus three squared. But now, whatever y value we were getting, we want to get four less than that. So when x equals three, instead\\nof getting y equals zero, we want to get y equals\\nfour less, or negative four. When x equals four,\\ninstead of getting one, we want to get y is\\nequal to negative three. So whatever y value we were getting, we want to now get four less than that. So the shifting in the vertical direction is a little bit more intuitive. If we shift down, we subtract that amount. If we shift up, we add that amount. So this, right over here,\\nis the equation for g of x. G of x is going to be equal\\nto x minus three squared minus four. And once again, just to review, replacing the x with x\\nminus three, on f of x, that's what shifted, shifted right by three, by three. And then, subtracting the four, that shifted us down by four, shifted down by four, to give us this next graph. And you can visualize, or\\nyou can verify visually, that if you shift each of these\\npoints exactly down by four, we are, we are indeed going to overlap on top of g of x. \",\n",
       " '14.13.3': \"- [Instructor] Function\\nG can be thought of as a scaled version of F\\nof X is equal to X squared. Write the equation for G of X. So like always, pause this video and see if you can do it on your own. Alright now, let's work\\nthrough this together. So the first thing that\\nwe might appreciate is that G seems not only to\\nbe flipped over the x-axis, but then flipped over\\nand then stretched wider. So let's do these in steps. So first let's flip over, flip over the x-axis. So if we were to do this\\nvisually it would look like this. Instead when X is equal to zero, Y is still gonna be equal to zero. But when X is equal to negative one, instead of Y being equal to one, it'd now be equal to negative one. When X is equal to one,\\ninstead of squaring one and getting one, you then\\ntake the negative of that to get to negative one. So when you flip it, it looks like this. Y when is X is equal to negative two instead of Y being equal to four, it would now be equal to negative four. So it would look like this. So as we just talk through\\nas we're trying to draw this flipped over version, whatever Y value we were\\ngetting before for a given X, we would now get the opposite\\nof it, or the negative of it. So this green function right over here is going to be Y is equal\\nto the negative of F of X, or we could say Y is equal\\nto negative X squared. Whatever the X is, you square it, and then you take the negative of it. Whatever X is, you square it, and then you take the negative of it, and you see that that will\\nflip it over the x-axis. But that by itself does\\nnot get us to G of X. G of X also seems to be stretched in the horizontal direction. And so let's think about,\\ncan we multiply this times some scaling factor so\\nthat it does that stretching so that we can match up to G of X? And the best way to do\\nthis is to pick a point that we know sits on G of X,\\nand they in fact give us one. They show us right over\\nhere that at the point two comma negative one, sits on G of X. When X is equal to two, Y is equal to negative one on G of X. So you could say G of two is negative one. Now on our green function,\\nwhen X is equal to two Y is equal to negative four. So let's see. Maybe we can just multiply\\nthis by 1/4 to get our G. So let's see. If we were to, let's\\nsee if we scale by 1/4, does that do the trick? Scale by 1/4. So in that case, we're gonna have Y is equal to not just negative X squared, but negative 1/4 X squared. And if you're saying hey,\\nso how did you get 1/4? Well I looked at when X is equal to two. On our green function,\\nwhen X is equal to two I get to negative four. Well we want that when X is equal to two to be equal to negative one. Well negative one is 1/4 of negative four, so that's why I said\\nokay, well let's up take to see if we could take\\nour green function, and if I multiply it by 1/4, that seems like it will\\nmatch up with G of X. And so let's verify that. When X is equal to\\nzero, well this is still all gonna be equal to\\nzero so that makes sense. When X is equal to one, let me do this in another color, when X is equal to one, then one squared times negative 1/4, well that does indeed look\\nlike negative 1/4 right there. When X is equal to two,\\ntwo squared is four, times negative 1/4 is indeed\\nequal to negative one. Let's try this point\\nhere 'cause it looks like this is sitting on our graph as well. When X is equal to four,\\nfour squared is 16. 16 times negative 1/4 is\\nindeed equal to negative four. And it does work also for the\\nnegative values of X as well. So I'm feeling really good that this is the equation of G of X. G of X is equal to negative\\n1/4 times X squared. And so in general, that\\nwhen we were saying we were scaling it, we're\\nscaling it by negative value. This is what flips it over the x-axis, and then multiplying it by this fraction that has an absolute value less than one, this is actually stretching it wider. If this value right over here, its absolute value was greater than one, then it would stretch it vertically, or would make it thinner in\\nthe horizontal direction. \",\n",
       " '15.1.1': \"So let's talk a little bit\\nabout rational numbers. And the simple way to think\\nabout it is any number that can be represented as\\nthe ratio of two integers is a rational number. So for example, any integer\\nis a rational number. 1 can be represented as 1/1 or\\nas negative 2 over negative 2 or as 10,000/10,000. In all of these cases, these are\\nall different representations of the number 1,\\nratio of two integers. And I obviously can\\nhave an infinite number of representations\\nof 1 in this way, the same number over\\nthe same number. The number negative 7 could be\\nrepresented as negative 7/1, or 7 over negative 1, or\\nnegative 14 over positive 2. And I could go on, and\\non, and on, and on. So negative 7 is definitely\\na rational number. It can be represented as\\nthe ratio of two integers. But what about things\\nthat are not integers? For example, let us imagine--\\noh, I don't know-- 3.75. How can we represent that as\\nthe ratio of two integers? Well, 3.75, you\\ncould rewrite that as 375/100, which is the\\nsame thing as 750/200. Or you could say, hey,\\n3.75 is the same thing as 3 and 3/4-- so let\\nme write it here-- which is the same\\nthing as-- that's 15/4. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 3 is\\n15, so you could write this. This is the same thing as 15/4. Or we could write this as\\nnegative 30 over negative 8. I just multiplied the\\nnumerator and the denominator here by negative 2. But just to be clear,\\nthis is clearly rational. I'm giving you multiple\\nexamples of how this can be represented as\\nthe ratio of two integers. Now, what about\\nrepeating decimals? Well, let's take\\nmaybe the most famous of the repeating decimals. Let's say you have 0.333, just\\nkeeps going on and on forever, which we can denote by\\nputting that little bar on top of the 3. This is 0.3 repeating. And we've seen--\\nand later we'll show how you can convert\\nany repeating decimal as the ratio of two integers--\\nthis is clearly 1/3. Or maybe you've seen things like\\n0.6 repeating, which is 2/3. And there's many, many,\\nmany other examples of this. And we'll see any\\nrepeating decimal, not just one digit repeating. Even if it has a million\\ndigits repeating, as long as the pattern\\nstarts to repeat itself over and over and\\nover again, you can always represent that as\\nthe ratio of two integers. So I know what you're\\nprobably thinking. Hey, Sal, you've\\njust included a lot. You've included all\\nof the integers. You've included all of finite\\nnon-repeating decimals, and you've also included\\nrepeating decimals. What is left? Are there any numbers\\nthat are not rational? And you're probably\\nguessing that there are, otherwise people\\nwouldn't have taken the trouble of trying to\\nlabel these as rational. And it turns out-- as you\\ncan imagine-- that actually some of the most famous\\nnumbers in all of mathematics are not rational. And we call these numbers\\nirrational numbers. And I've listed there\\njust a few of the most noteworthy examples. Pi-- the ratio of\\nthe circumference to the diameter of a circle--\\nis an irrational number. It never terminates. It goes on and on and on\\nforever, and it never repeats. e, same thing-- never\\nterminates, never repeats. It comes out of continuously\\ncompounding interest. It comes out of\\ncomplex analysis. e shows up all over the place. Square root of 2,\\nirrational number. Phi, the golden ratio,\\nirrational number. So these things that\\nreally just pop out of nature, many of these\\nnumbers are irrational. Now, you might say, OK,\\nare these irrational? These are just these\\nspecial kind of numbers. But maybe most\\nnumbers are rational, and Sal's just picked out\\nsome special cases here. But the important thing to\\nrealize is they do seem exotic, and they are exotic\\nin certain ways. But they aren't uncommon. It actually turns out\\nthat there is always an irrational number between\\nany two rational numbers. Well, we could go on and on. There's actually\\nan infinite number. But there's at least one,\\nso that gives you an idea that you can't\\nreally say that there are fewer irrational numbers\\nthan rational numbers. And in a future\\nvideo, we'll prove that you give me two rational\\nnumbers-- rational 1, rational 2-- there's going to be\\nat least one irrational number between those, which\\nis a neat result, because irrational\\nnumbers seem to be exotic. Another way to think about it--\\nI took the square root of 2, but you take the square root\\nof any non-perfect square, you're going to end up\\nwith an irrational number. You take the sum\\nof an irrational and a rational number-- and\\nwe'll see this later on. We'll prove it to ourselves. The sum of an irrational\\nand a rational is going to be irrational. The product of an\\nirrational and a rational is going to be irrational. So there's a lot, a lot, a\\nlot of irrational numbers out there. \",\n",
       " '15.1.2': \"Which of the following real\\nnumbers are irrational? Well, irrational just\\nmeans it's not rational. It means that you cannot\\nexpress it as the ratio of two integers. So let's see what we have here. So we have the square\\nroot of 8 over 2. If you take the square root\\nof a number that is not a perfect square, it is\\ngoing to be irrational. And then if you just take\\nthat irrational number and you multiply it, and you\\ndivide it by any other numbers, you're still going to\\nget an irrational number. So square root of\\n8 is irrational. You divide that by 2,\\nit is still irrational. So this is not rational. Or in other words, I'm\\nsaying it is irrational. Now, you have pi,\\n3.14159-- it just keeps going on and on and on\\nforever without ever repeating. So this is irrational,\\nprobably the most famous of all of the\\nirrational numbers. 5.0-- well, I can\\nrepresent 5.0 as 5/1. So 5.0 is rational. It is not irrational. 0.325-- well, this is the\\nsame thing as 325/1000. So I can clearly represent\\nit as a ratio of integers. So this is rational. Just as I could represent\\n5.0 as 5/1, both of these are rational. They are not irrational. Here I have\\n7.777777, and it just keeps going on and\\non and on forever. And the way we denote\\nthat, you could just say these dots that say\\nthat the 7's keep going. Or you could say 7.7. And this line shows that\\nthe 7 part, the second 7, just keeps repeating on forever. Now, if you have a repeating\\ndecimal-- in other videos, we'll actually convert\\nthem into fractions-- but a repeating decimal\\ncan be represented as a ratio of two integers. Just as 1/3 is equal to\\n0.333 on and on and on. Or I could say it like this. I could say 3 repeating. We can also do the\\nsame thing for that. I won't do it here,\\nbut this is rational. So it's not irrational. 8 and 1/2? Well, that's the same thing. 8 and 1/2 is the\\nsame thing as 17/2. So it's clearly rational. So the only two\\nirrational numbers are the first two\\nright over here. \",\n",
       " '15.2.1': \"What I want to do in\\nthis video is think about whether the product or\\nsums of rational numbers are definitely going\\nto be rational. So let's just first\\nthink about the product of rational numbers. So if I have one rational\\nnumber and-- actually, let me instead of writing\\nout the word rational, let me just represent it\\nas a ratio of two integers. So I have one rational\\nnumber right over there. I can represent it as a/b. And I'm going to multiply it\\ntimes another rational number, and I can represent that as a\\nratio of two integers, m and n. And so what is this\\nproduct going to be? Well, the numerator,\\nI'm going to have am. I'm going to have a times m. And in the denominator, I'm\\ngoing to have b times n. Well a is an integer,\\nm is an integer. So you have an integer\\nin the numerator. And b is an integer\\nand n is an integer. So you have an integer\\nin the denominator. So now the product is a ratio\\nof two integers right over here, so the product is also rational. So this thing is also rational. So if you give me the product\\nof any two rational numbers, you're going to end up\\nwith a rational number. Let's see if the same thing\\nis true for the sum of two rational numbers. So let's say my first\\nrational number is a/b, or can be represented as a/b, and\\nmy second rational number can be represented as m/n. Well, how would I add these two? Well, I can find a\\ncommon denominator, and the easiest\\none is b times n. So let me multiply\\nthis fraction. We multiply this one times\\nn in the numerator and n in the denominator. And let me multiply\\nthis one times b in the numerator and\\nb in the denominator. Now we've written\\nthem so they have a common denominator of bn. And so this is going to\\nbe equal to an plus bm, all of that over b times n. So b times n, we've\\njust talked about. This is definitely going to\\nbe an integer right over here. And then what do\\nwe have up here? Well, we have a times\\nn, which is an integer. b times m is another integer. The sum of two integers\\nis going to be an integer. So you have an integer\\nover in an integer. You have the ratio\\nof two integers. So the sum of two\\nrational numbers is going to give you another. So this one right over\\nhere was rational, and this one is right\\nover here is rational. So you take the product\\nof two rational numbers, you get a rational number. You take the sum of\\ntwo rational numbers, you get a rational number. \",\n",
       " '15.2.2': \"What I want to do\\nwith this video is do a quick proof that if\\nwe take a rational number, and we multiply it times\\nan irrational number, that this is going to give\\nus an irrational number. And I encourage you to\\nactually pause the video and try to think if you\\ncan prove this on your own. And I'll give you a hint. You can prove it by a proof\\nthrough contradiction. Assume that a rational\\ntimes an irrational gets you a rational number, and\\nthen see by manipulating it, whether you can establish that\\nall of a sudden this irrational number must somehow be rational. So I'm assuming you've\\ngiven a go at it. So let's think about\\nit a little bit. I said we will do it through\\na proof by contradiction. So let's just assume that a\\nrational times an irrational gives us a rational number. So let's say that this-- to\\nrepresent this rational right over here, let's represent\\nit as the ratio of two integers, a over b. And then this irrational\\nnumber, I'll just call that x. So we're saying a/b times x can\\nget us some rational number. So let's call that m/n. Let's call this equaling m/n. So I'm assuming that a\\nrational number, which can be expressed as the\\nratio of two integers, times an irrational number can\\nget me another rational number. So let's see if we can set\\nup some form of contradiction here. Let's solve for the\\nirrational number. The best way to\\nsolve is to multiply both sides times the reciprocal\\nof this number right over here. So this, let's multiply\\ntimes b/a, times b/a. And what are we left with? We get our irrational number\\nx being equal to m times b. Or we could just\\nwrite that as mb/na. So why is this interesting? Well, m is an integer,\\nb is an integer, so this whole numerator\\nis an integer. And then this whole\\ndenominator is some integer. So right over here, I have\\na ratio of two integers. So I've just expressed\\nwhat we assumed to be an irrational number,\\nI've just it expressed it as the ratio of two integers. So now we have x\\nmust be rational. And that is our\\ncontradiction, because we assumed that x is irrational. And so therefore,\\nsince this assumption leads to this contradiction\\nright over here, this assumption must be false. It must be that a rational times\\nan irrational is irrational. \",\n",
       " '15.2.3': \"So I'm curious as\\nto what happens if I were to take\\na rational number and I were to add it to\\nan irrational number. Is the resulting number going\\nto be rational or irrational? Well, to think about\\nthis, let's just assume it's going to be\\nrational and then see if this leads to any\\nform of contradiction. So let's assume\\nthat this is going to give us a rational number. So let's say that this\\nfirst rational number we can represent as the ratio\\nof two integers, a and b. Let's call this irrational\\nnumber, let's just call this x. And their sum gives us\\nanother rational number. Well, let's express\\nthat as the ratio of two other integers, m and n. So we're saying that a/b\\nplus x is equal to m/n. Well, another way of\\nthinking about it-- we could subtract\\na/b from both sides and we would get our\\nirrational number x is equal to m/n\\nminus a/b, which is the same thing as n\\ntimes b in the denominator. And then let's see. m/n is the same\\nthing as mb over nb. So this would be mb. I'm just adding\\nthese two fractions. mb minus-- Let's see. a/b is the same thing\\nas n times a over n times b. So minus n times a. All I did is I added\\nthese two fractions. I found a common denominator. So to make it clear, I\\nmultiplied this one b and b, and then I multiplied\\nthis one n and n then I just added these two things,\\nand I got this expression right over here. So this denominator\\nis clearly an integer. I have the product\\nof two integers. That's going to be an integer. That's going to be an integer. And then this numerator,\\nmb, is an integer. na is an integer. The difference of two integers. This whole thing is\\ngoing to be an integer. So it looks like, assuming\\nthat the sum is rational, that all of a sudden we\\nhave this contradiction. We assumed that x is irrational,\\nwe're assuming x is irrational, but, all of a sudden, because\\nwe made that assumption, we're able to assume\\nthat we can represent it as this ratio of two integers. So this tells us that\\nx must be rational. And that is the contradiction. That is a very large\\ncontradiction right over there. The assumption was\\nthat x is irrational. Now we got that x\\nmust be rational. So, therefore, this\\ncannot be the case. A rational plus an\\nirrational must-- so this is not right--\\na rational plus an irrational must\\nbe irrational. Let me write that down. So a rational plus an\\nirrational must be irrational. \",\n",
       " '15.2.4': \"- [Instructor] Let's say\\nthat we have some number a and to that we are going\\nto add some number b and that sum is going to be equal to c. Let's say that we're also told that both a and b are irrational. Irrational. So based on the information\\nthat I've given you, a and b are both irrational. Is their sum, c, is that going\\nto be rational or irrational? I encourage you to pause the video and try to answer that on your own. I'm guessing that you might have struggled with this a little bit\\nbecause the answer is that we actually don't know. It depends on what irrational\\nnumbers a and b actually are. What do I mean by that? Well, I can pick two irrational numbers where their sum actually\\nis going to be rational. What do I mean? Well what if a is equal to pi and b is equal to one minus pi? Now both of these are irrational numbers. Pi is irrational and one minus\\npi, whatever this value is, this is irrational as well. But if we add these two things together, if we add pi plus one minus pi, one minus pi, well these are gonna add up to be equal to one, which is clearly going\\nto be a rational number. So we were able to find one scenario in which we added two irrationals and the sum gives us a rational. In general you could do this trick with any irrational number. Instead of pi you could've had square root of two plus one\\nminus the square root of two. Both of these, what we have in this\\norange color is irrational, what we have in this\\nblue color is irrational, but the sum is going to be rational. And you could do this,\\ninstead of having one minus, you could have this as 1/2 minus. You could have done it a bunch\\nof different combinations so that you could end up\\nwith a sum that is rational. But you could also easily\\nadd two irrational numbers and still end up with\\nan irrational number. For example, if a is pi and b is pi, well then their sum is\\ngoing to be equal to two pi, which is still irrational. Or if you added pi plus the square root of two, this is still going to be irrational. In fact, mathematically\\nI would just express this as pi plus the square root of two. This is some number right over here, but this is still going to be irrational. So the big takeaway is\\nif you're taking the sums of two irrational numbers and people don't tell you anything else, they don't tell you which specific irrational numbers they are, you don't know whether their sum is going to be rational or irrational. Now let's think about products. Similar exercise, let's\\nsay we have a times b is equal to c, ab is equal to c, a times b is equal to c. And once again, let's\\nsay someone tells you that both a and b are irrational. Pause this video and think about whether c must be rational, irrational, or whether we just don't know. Try to figure out some examples like we just did when we looked at sums. Alright, so let's think about, let's see if we can construct examples where c ends up being rational. Well one thing, as you\\ncan tell I like to use pi, pi might be my favorite irrational number. If a was one over pi and b is pi, well, what's their product going to be? Well, their product is going\\nto be one over pi times pi, that's just going to be pi\\nover pi, which is equal to one. Here we got a situation where\\nthe product of two irrationals became, or is, rational. But what if I were to multiply, and in general you could this with a lot of irrational numbers, one over square root of two\\ntimes the square of two, that would be one. What if instead I had pi times pi? Pi times pi, that you could\\njust write as pi squared, and pi squared is still\\ngoing to be irrational. This is irrational, irrational. It isn't even always the case that if you multiply the\\nsame irrational number, if you square an irrational number that it's always going to be irrational. For example, if I have\\nsquare root of two times, I think you see where this is going, times the square root of two, I'm taking the product of\\ntwo irrational numbers. In fact, they're the\\nsame irrational number, but the square root of two\\ntimes the square root of two, well, that's just going\\nto be equal to two, which is clearly a rational number. So once again, when\\nyou're taking the product of two irrational numbers, you don't know whether the product is going to be rational or irrational unless someone tells you\\nthe specific numbers. Whether you're taking the product or the sum of irrational numbers, in order to know whether\\nthe resulting number is irrational or rational,\\nyou need to know something about what you're taking\\nthe sum or the product of. \",\n",
       " '15.2.5': \"Let's think about whether\\neach of these expressions produce rational or\\nirrational numbers. And just as a reminder,\\na rational number is one-- so if you have\\na rational number x, it can be expressed as the\\nratio of two integers, m and n. And if you have an irrational\\nnumber, this cannot happen. So let's think\\nabout each of these. So 9 is clearly a\\nrational number. You can express 9 as\\n9/1, 18/2, or 27/3. So it can clearly be expressed\\nas the ratio of two integers. But what about the\\nsquare root of 45? So let's think about\\nthat a little bit. Square root of 45. That's the same thing as the\\nsquare root of 9 times 5, which is the same thing\\nas the square root of 9 times the square root of 5. The principal root\\nof 9 is 3, so it's 3 times the square root of 5. So this is going to be 9 plus\\n3 times the square root of 5. So the square root\\nof 5 is irrational. You're taking the square root\\nof a non-perfect square right over here. Irrational. 3 is rational, but the product\\nof a rational and an irrational is still going to be irrational. So that's going\\nto be irrational. And then you're taking\\nan irrational number and you're adding 9 to it. You're adding a\\nrational number to it. But you add a rational\\nto an irrational, and you're still going\\nto have an irrational. So this whole thing\\nis irrational. Now let's think about this\\nexpression right over here. Well, the numerator\\ncan be rewritten as the square root of 9 times\\n5 over 3 times the square root of 5. Well, that's the same\\nthing as the square root of 9 times the square root of\\n5 over 3 times the square root of 5. Well, that's the same thing as\\n3 times the square root of 5 over 3 times the\\nsquare root of 5. Well, that's just\\ngoing to be equal to 1. Or you could view it as 1/1. And 1 is clearly\\na rational number. You could write it as 1/1,\\n2/2, 3/3, really any integer over itself. So this is going to be rational. Now, let's do this last\\nexpression right over here. 3 times the principal root of 9. Well, what's the\\nprincipal root of 9? Well, it's 3. So this is going to be 3\\ntimes 3, which is equal to 9. And we've already\\ntalked about the fact that 9 can clearly be\\nexpressed as the ratio of two integers-- 9/1, 27/3, 45/5, all\\ndifferent ways of expressing 9. \",\n",
       " '15.2.6': \"- We're to let a and\\nb be rational numbers, and let b be non-zero, they\\nhave to say let b be non-zero because we're about to divide by b. Is a over b rational or irrational? Well let's think about it,\\nthey're both rational numbers so that means that a, since\\nit's rational, can be expressed as the ratio of two integers,\\nso I can write a is equal to m over n, and same thing about\\nb, I could write b as being equal to p over q, where where m, n, p, and q are integers, are integers, by definition of what a rational number is, they're\\ntelling us these numbers are rational so I can express\\nthem as these types of ratios. So what is a over b going to be? a over b is going to be m over n over p over q which is equal to m over n,\\nif I divide by a fraction, it's the same thing as\\nmultiplying by the reciprocal. q over p, let me write that a little bit, q over p which is equal to mq over np. Well mq is going to be an\\ninteger, if the product of two integers is going to be\\nan integer, and np is going to be another integer, the\\nproduct of two integers is an integer, so I've just shown that a over b can be expressed as the ratio of\\ntwo integers, so a over b is for sure, in fact I've just\\nproven it to you, a over b is for sure going to be rational. Let's do a few more of\\nthese, this is interesting. All right, so now we're saying let a and b be irrational numbers. Is a over b, let a and\\nb be irrational numbers. Is a over b rational or irrational? And, like always, pause\\nthe video and try to think this through, and you\\nmight want do some examples of some irrational numbers\\nand see if you can get, when you divide them, you can get rational or irrational numbers. Well, let's just imagine\\na world where, let's say, that a is equal to, I dunno, two square roots of two, and b is equal to the square root of two. Well, in that world, a\\nover b, a over b would be two square roots of two\\nover the square root of two which would be two, which is\\nvery much a rational number, I can express that as a ratio\\nof integers, I can write that as two over one, there's actually\\nan infinite number of ways I can express that as a\\nratio of two integers. So, in this case, I was able\\nto get a over b to be rational, based on a and b being irrational. But, what if, what if instead of, what if a was equal to the square root of two and b is equal to the square root of, let's say, b is equal\\nto the square root of seven. Well, then a over b would\\nbe equal to the square root of two over the square root\\nof seven, which is still going to be irrational, I\\nmean another way to think about it, and I'm not proving\\nit here, but you could think about it, this is\\ngoing to be the square root of two sevens, so we\\nhave something that's not a perfect square under the\\nradical, so we're going to end up with an irrational number. So, we can show one example where a over b is rational and we showed one example where it is irrational,\\nso it can be either way. Let's do a few more of these. All right, let a be a\\nnon-zero rational number. Is a times the square root of\\neight rational or irrational? Well, the key here is, if you\\nmultiply an irrational number and why is this an irrational number? It has a perfect square\\nin it, but it's not a perfect square in and of itself. The square root of eight is,\\nthe square root of eight is equal to the square\\nroot of four times two, which is equal to the\\nsquare root of four times the square root of two, which is equal to two square roots of two. And, this is kind of\\ngetting to the punchline of this problem, but if I\\nmultiply a rational times an irrational, I am going\\nto get an irrational. So the square root of\\neight is an irrational, and if I multiply that\\ntimes a rational number, I'm still going to get\\nan irrational number. So this is going to be,\\nfor sure, irrational. Let's do one more of these. So we're to let a be an irrational number. Is negative 24 plus a\\nrational or irrational? And I won't give a formal\\nproof here, but to give you more of an intuitive feel,\\nit's nice to just try out some numbers, and I encourage\\nyou to pause the video and try to think through it yourself. Let's just imagine some values,\\nimagine if a is irrational, a is irrational, so what\\nif a was equal to negative pi, which is approximately\\nequal to negative three point one four one five nine and it keeps going on and on forever, never repeating. Well, then we would have negative 24 plus a would be equal to negative 24 minus pi, which would be approximately negative 27 point one for one five\\nnine, the decimal expansion, everything to the right of\\nthe decimal, is going to be the exact same thing as pi. So this looks like, at least\\nfor this example, is going to be irrational, and let's\\nsee, if a was square root of two negative 24 plus the square root of two, well, once again, I'm\\nnot doing a proof here, but intuitively, this is\\ngoing to be a decimal, it's going to have a decimal expansion that's going to go on\\nforever and never repeat, and so this would just\\nchange what's to the left of the decimal, but not\\nreally change what's, well it would change what's\\nto the right of the decimal because this is negative,\\nbut it's still going to go on forever and never repeat,\\nand if, in fact, this was if this was this way, then\\nto the right of the decimal, you would have the same thing\\nas the square root of two to the left of the decimal,\\nyou would just have a different value, you\\nwould have negative 25 point whatever whatever whatever,\\nand so this is, when you add a rational number to an\\nirrational number, we've proven in other videos, a\\nrational plus an irrational is going to be irrational, irrational. If you want that proof,\\nwe have other videos within this tutorial. \",\n",
       " '15.3.1': \"What I want to do in this\\nvideo is prove to you that the square root\\nof 2 is irrational. And I'm going to do this through\\na proof by contradiction. And the proof by\\ncontradiction is set up by assuming the opposite. So this is our goal, but\\nfor the sake of our proof, let's assume the opposite. Let's assume that square\\nroot of 2 is rational. And then we'll see if we\\nlead to a contradiction, that this actually\\ncannot be the case. And if it cannot be the\\ncase that is rational, if we get to a contradiction by\\nassuming the square root of 2 is rational, then we have to\\ndeduce that the square root of 2 must be irrational. So let's assume the opposite. Square root of 2 is rational. Well, if the square\\nroot of 2 is rational, that means that we can\\nwrite the square root of 2 as the ratio of two\\nintegers, a and b. And we can also\\nassume that these have no factors in common. Let's say that they did\\nhave some factors in common. If we divided the numerator\\nand the denominator by those same factors, then\\nyou're getting into a situation where they have no\\nfactors in common. Or another way of saying is\\nthat a and b are co-prime. Or another way of\\nsaying it is we could write this as a\\nratio of two integers where this is irreducible,\\nwhere these no longer share any factors. If you can write anything as\\nthe ratio of two integers, then you could obviously\\nsimplify it further, factor out any common\\nfactors to get it to a point where it is irreducible. So I'm going to assume\\nthat my a and b, that this fraction right\\nover here, is irreducible. And this is important for\\nsetting up our contradiction. So I'm going to assume that this\\nright over here is irreducible. a and b have no\\nfactors in common. Let me write that\\ndown because that's so important for this proof. a and-- want to do\\nthat same color-- a and b have no factors in\\ncommon, other than, I guess, 1. So this is irreducible. These two numbers are co-prime. So what does that do for us? Well, let's just try to\\nmanipulate this a little bit. Let's square both\\nsides of this equation. So if you square the\\nprincipal root of 2, you're going to get 2. And that's going to be equal\\nto a squared over b squared. And that just comes\\nfrom a over b squared is the same thing as a\\nsquared over b squared. And now we can multiply both\\nsides of this by b squared. And so we get 2 times b\\nsquared is equal to a squared. Now, what does this\\ntell us about a squared? Well, a squared is some\\nnumber, b squared times 2. So anything times 2 is going--\\nthis is going to be an integer. We assumed b is an integer, so\\nb squared must be an integer, and so you have an\\ninteger times 2. Well, that must give\\nyou an even number. That must give you\\nan even integer. So this right over\\nhere, a squared, must be-- so this tells us\\nthat a squared must be even. Now, why is that interesting? Well, a squared is the\\nproduct of two numbers or is the product\\nof the same number. It's a times a. So this is another way of\\nsaying that a times a is even. So what does that\\ntell us about a? Let's just remind ourselves. a is either going to\\nbe-- we're assuming a is an integer-- a is either\\ngoing to be even or odd. We just have to remind\\nourselves if we multiply an even times an even,\\nwe get an even number. If we multiply an odd times\\nan odd, we get an odd number. So we have a number\\ntimes itself. We got an even number. Well, the only way to get that\\nis if that number is even. So this tells us that a is even. And another way of\\nsaying that a is even is to say that a\\ncan be represented as the product of 2\\ntimes some integer. So let's say some integer k. So where is all of this going? Well, as you'll\\nsee, we can then use this to show that b\\nmust also be even. So let's think about\\nthat a little bit. So let's go back to this\\nstep right over here. If we say that a\\ncan be represented as two times the\\nproduct of some integer, and that comes out of\\nthe fact that a is even. Then we can rewrite this\\nexpression right over here as 2-- I'll do it\\nover here-- 2 times b squared is equal\\nto 2k squared. Instead of a squared, I\\ncould write 2k squared. We're claiming,\\nor we're deducing, that, assuming everything we've\\njust assumed, that a is even. So if a is even, it\\ncan be represented as a product of 2\\nand some integer. And then we can write\\nthat 2 times b squared is equal to 4k squared. And then you divide\\nboth sides by 2. You get b squared is\\nequal to 2k squared. And this tells us\\nthat, well, k squared is going to be an integer. You take any integer\\ntimes 2 you're going to get an even value. So this tells us that\\nb squared is even. So that tells us that\\nb squared is even. Well, if b squared is even, by\\nthe same logic we just used, that tells us that b is even. So here's our contradiction. We assumed, in the\\nbeginning, that a and b have no common\\nfactors other than 1. We assumed that this fraction\\nright over here, a/b, is irreducible. But from that and\\nthe fact that a/b must be equal to the\\nsquare root of 2, we were able to deduce that\\na is even and b is even. Well, if a is even\\nand b is even, and they both have\\n2 as a factor, and then this isn't irreducible. You could divide the numerator\\nand the denominator by 2. a and b have a common factor of 2. So let me write this down. So this is just\\nto make it clear. So from this and this, we have\\na and b have common factor of 2, which means that a\\nover b is reducible. And so that's the contradiction. So you assume that\\nsquare root of 2 can be represented as an\\nirreducible fraction a/b, irreducible because you can\\nsay ratio of two integers right over here, that leads\\nyou to the contradiction that, no, it actually\\ncan be reducible. So, therefore, you cannot\\nmake this assumption. It leads to a contradiction. Square root of 2\\nmust be irrational. \",\n",
       " '15.3.2': \"In a previous video, we used\\na proof by contradiction to show that the square\\nroot of 2 is irrational. What I want to do in\\nthis video is essentially use the same argument but\\ndo it in a more general way to show that the square root of\\nany prime number is irrational. So let's assume that p is prime. And we're going to set this up\\nto be a proof by contradiction. So we're going to assume\\nthat the square root of p is rational and see if this\\nleads us to any contradiction. So if something\\nis rational, that means that we can represent it\\nas the ratio of two integers. And if we can\\nrepresent something as the ratio of\\ntwo integers, that means that we can\\nalso represent it as the ratio of two\\nco-prime integers, or two integers that have\\nno factors in common. Or that we can represent it as\\na fraction that is irreducible. So I'm assuming\\nthat this fraction that I'm writing\\nright over here, a/b, that this right over here\\nis an irreducible fraction. You say, well,\\nhow can I do that? Well, this being rational says\\nI can represent the square root of p as some fraction, as\\nsome ratio of two integers. And if I can represent anything\\nas a ratio of two integers, I can keep dividing both the\\nnumerator and the denominator by the common factors\\nuntil I eventually get to an irreducible fraction. So I'm assuming that's\\nwhere we are right here. So this cannot be reduced. And this is important for our\\nproof-- cannot be reduced, which is another way of saying\\nthat a and b are co-prime, which is another way of saying\\nthat a and b share no common factors other than 1. So let's see if we can\\nmanipulate this a little bit. Let's take the\\nsquare of both sides. We get p is equal to-- well,\\na/b, the whole thing squared, that's the same thing as\\na squared over b squared. We can multiply both\\nsides by b squared, and we get b squared times\\np is equal to a squared. Well, what does this\\ntell us about a squared? Well, b is an integer, so b\\nsquared must be an integer. So an integer times p\\nis equal to a squared. Well, that means that p must\\nbe a factor of a squared. Let me write this down. So a squared is a multiple of p. Now, what does that\\ntell us about a? Does that tell us that a\\nmust also be a multiple of p? Well, to think about\\nthat, let's think about the prime\\nfactorization of a. Let's say that a can\\nbe-- and any number-- can be rewritten as a\\nproduct of primes. Or any integer, I should say. So let's write this out\\nas a product of primes right over here. So let's say that I have\\nmy first prime factor times my second prime factor, all\\nthe way to my nth prime factor. I don't know how many prime\\nfactors a actually has. I'm just saying that a is\\nsome integer right over here. So that's the prime\\nfactorization of a. What is the prime factorization\\nof a squared going to be? Well, a squared\\nis just a times a. Its prime factorization is\\ngoing to be f1 times f2, all the way to fn. And then that times f1 times\\nf2 times, all the way to fn. Or I could rearrange\\nthem if I want. f1 times f1 times f2 times f2,\\nall the way to fn times fn. Now, we know that a squared\\nis a multiple of p. p is a prime number,\\nso p must be one of these numbers in the\\nprime factorization. p could be f2, or p\\ncould be f1, but p needs to be one of these numbers\\nin the prime factorization. So p needs to be one\\nof these factors. Well, if it's, let's\\nsay-- and I'll just pick one of these arbitrarily. Let's say that p is f2. If p is f2, then that means\\nthat p is also a factor of a. So this allows us to deduce\\nthat a is a multiple of p. Or another way of saying\\nthat is that we can represent a as being some integer times p. Now, why is that interesting? And actually, let\\nme box this off, because we're going to\\nreuse this part later. But how can we use this? Well, just like we did in the\\nproof of the square root of 2 being irrational, let's\\nnow substitute this back into this equation\\nright over here. So we get b squared times p. We have b squared times\\np is equal to a squared. Well, a, we're now\\nsaying we can represent that as some integer k times p. So we can rewrite that as\\nsome integer k times p. And so, let's see, if we\\nwere to multiply this out. So we get b squared times\\np-- and you probably see where this is going--\\nis equal to k squared times p squared. We can divide both\\nsides by p, and we get b squared is equal\\nto p times k squared. Or k squared times p. Well, the same\\nargument that we used, if a squared is equal to b\\nsquared times p, that let us know that a squared\\nis a multiple of p. So now we have it\\nthe other way around. b squared is equal to\\nsome integer squared, which is still going to\\nbe an integer, times p. So b squared must\\nbe a multiple of p. So this lets us know that b\\nsquared is a multiple of p. And by the logic\\nthat we applied right over here, that lets us know\\nthat b is a multiple of p. And that's our contradiction,\\nor this establishes our contradiction that we\\nassumed at the beginning. We assumed that a\\nand b are co-prime, that they share no factors\\nin common other than 1. We assumed that this\\ncannot be reduced. But we've just established,\\njust from this, we have deduced that\\nis a multiple of p and b is a multiple of p. Which means that this\\nfraction can be reduced. We can divide the numerator\\nand the denominator by p. So that is our contradiction. We started assuming\\nit cannot be reduced, but then we showed that, no,\\nit must be able to be reduced. The numerator and\\nthe denominator have a common factor of p. So our contradiction\\nis established. Square root of p\\ncannot be rational. Square root of p is irrational. Let me just write it down. The square root of p\\nis irrational because of the contradiction. \",\n",
       " '15.3.3': \"What I want to do in this video\\nis prove that between any two rational numbers-- so let's say\\nthat's a rational number there, and then let's say that this\\nis another rational number that is larger than\\nthis one right over here-- that between any\\ntwo rational numbers, you can find an\\nirrational number. So that number right\\nover there is irrational. You can find at least\\none irrational number. And that's kind of\\ncrazy, because there's a lot of rational numbers. There's an infinite number\\nof rational numbers. So we're saying between any\\ntwo of those rational numbers, you can always find\\nan irrational number. And we're going to start\\nthinking about it by just thinking about the\\ninterval between 0 and 1. So if we think about the\\ninterval between 0 and 1, we know that there are\\nirrational numbers there. In fact, one of them\\nthat might pop out at you is 1 over the square\\nroot of 2, which is the same thing as the\\nsquare root of 2 over 2, is equal-- I\\nshouldn't say equal, is roughly, is approximately\\nequal to 0.70710678118. And I could just\\nkeep going on and on and on and on and on and on. This thing does not repeat. But the important point is,\\nit's clearly between 0 and 1. So I could write 1 over\\nthe square root of 2 is clearly between 0 and 1. So the way that I'm going\\nto prove that there's an irrational number between\\nany two rational numbers is I'm going to start with\\nthis set of inequalities, and I'm going to\\nmanipulate it so I end up with an r1 over here\\nand an r2 over here. And then from 1 over\\nthe square root of 2, I would have manipulated\\nthis to construct that irrational-- at least\\none of the irrational numbers that's between those\\ntwo rational ones. So instead of making this\\nan interval between 0 and 1, let's make this an\\ninterval between 0 and the difference\\nbetween these two numbers. So the distance between\\nr1 and r2 is r2 minus r1. So let's multiply\\nboth sides of this-- or all three parts\\nof this inequality, I guess I could say, by\\nr2 times r2 minus r1. So let's do that. So if you multiply this,\\n0 times r2 minus r1, well you're just still\\ngoing to have 0 there, is less than-- And we know\\nthat r2 is greater than r1, so r2 minus-- let me make\\nit clear what we're doing. We're going to multiply\\neverything times r2 minus r1. r2, we're assuming,\\nis greater than r1, so this thing right over here\\nis going to be greater than 0. So if you multiply\\nthe different sides of an inequality by\\nsomething greater than 0, you don't switch the inequality. So 0 times that is 0, 1 over\\nthe square root of 2 times that is going to be 1\\nover the square root of 2 times r2 minus r1. And then that's going\\nto be less than-- well, 1 times that is just\\ngoing to be r2 minus r1. And now, we just have to kind\\nof shift everything over. So let's add r1 to\\nall sides of this. So if we add something to\\nall parts of the inequality, then that's also not going\\nto change the inequality. So we're going to\\nadd r1 over here. We can add r1 over here. And we can add r1 over there. And so on the\\nleft-hand side, we have r1 is less than r1 plus--\\nlet me just copy and paste all of this so I don't have\\nto keep changing colors. Whoops, that's not\\nwhat I wanted to do. Let me do this. There you go. All right. That should be pretty good. So copy and paste that. r1 plus this, plus that--\\nlet me write the plus down-- plus that, is less\\nthan-- that one is a different shade of\\nblue-- is less than-- well, what's r1 plus r2 minus r1? Well, that's just\\ngoing to be r2. So I've just shown\\nyou that you give me any two rational\\nnumbers, and I'm assuming r2 is greater\\nthan r1, I have just constructed an\\nirrational number that's going to be between those\\ntwo rational numbers. You take r1, you take the\\nlower of the rational numbers, and to that you add\\n1 over square root of 2 times the difference\\nbetween those two rational numbers,\\nand you are going to get this right over here\\nis an irrational number. You're saying hey, how do\\nI know that this thing-- how can I be satisfied that\\nthis thing is irrational? Well, we've already seen. You take the product of an\\nirrational and a rational, you get an irrational number. You take the sum of\\nan irrational number and a rational number, you\\nget an irrational number. So we've constructed\\nan irrational number that's between\\nthese two rationals. \"}"

       "  'What I want to do\\nin this video is think about the\\norigins of algebra. The origins of\\nalgebra, and the word, especially in association\\nwith the ideas that algebra now represents,\\ncomes from this book, or actually this is a page\\nof the book right over there. The English translation\\nfor the title of this book is the \"Compendious\\nBook on Calculation by Completion and Balancing.\" And it was written by a\\nPersian mathematician who lived in Baghdad\\nin, I believe, it was in the eighth\\nor ninth century. I believe it was actually 820\\nAD when he wrote this book. AD. And algebra is the Arabic word,\\nthat here is the actual title that he gave to it, which\\nis the Arabic title. Algebra means restoration\\nor completion. Restoration or completion. And he associated it in his book\\nwith a very specific operation, really taking something\\nfrom one side of an equation to another side of an equation. But we can actually\\nsee it right over here, and I don\\'t know\\nArabic, but I actually do know some\\nlanguages that seems to have borrowed a\\nlittle bit from Arabic, or maybe it went the\\nother way around. But this says Al-kitab,\\nand I know just enough Urdu and Hindi to understand\\na good India movie, but Al-kitab, kitab means book. So this part is book. Book. Al-mukhtasar, well, I think\\nthat means compendious, because I don\\'t know\\nthe word for compendious and that seems like that. Fihisab, hisab means\\ncalculation in Hindi or Urdu, so this is calculation. Calculation. Al-gabr, this is the root. This is the famous algebra,\\nthis is where it shows up. So this is for completion, you\\ncould view that as completion. Completion. And then wa\\'l-muqabala, and that\\nmeans essentially balancing. Balancing. Completion and balancing. So if we wanted\\nto translate it-- I know this isn\\'t a video\\non translating Arabic, but the book, I guess\\nthis is saying compendious on calculation by\\ncompletion and balancing is the rough translation\\nright over there. But that is the source\\nof the word algebra, and this is a very, very,\\nvery important book. Not just because it was the\\nfirst use of the word algebra, but many people viewed\\nthis book as the first time that algebra took a\\nlot of its modern-- took on many of\\nits modern ideas. Ideas of balancing an equation. The abstract problem\\nitself, not trying to do one off problems\\nhere or there. But al-Khwarizmi was\\nnot the first person, and just to get an idea of\\nwhere all this is happening. So he was hanging\\nout in Baghdad, and this part of\\nthe world shows up a lot in the history of algebra. But he was hanging\\nout right there in around the eighth\\nor ninth century. So let me draw a\\ntime line here, just so we can appreciate everything. So that is timeline,\\nand then whether or not you are religious, most\\nof our modern dates are dependent on the birth of\\nJesus, so that is right there. Maybe I\\'ll put a cross\\nover there to signify that. When we want to\\nbe non-religious, we say the common era. Before the common era, when\\nwe want to be religious we say AD, which means\\nin the year of our lord. I don\\'t know the Latin,\\nAnno Domini, I believe, year of our lord. And then when we want--\\nin the religious context, instead of saying before common\\nera, we say before Christ, BC. But either way, so this\\nis 1000 in the common era. This is 2000 in the common era. And obviously, we are\\nsitting-- at least when I\\'m making this video, I\\'m\\nsitting right about there. And then this is 1000\\nbefore the common era, and this is 2000\\nbefore the common era. So the first traces--\\nand I\\'m skipping out, and really, it\\'s just\\nwhat we can find. I\\'m sure if we were\\nable to dig more, we might be able to\\nfind other evidence of different civilizations\\nand different people stumbling on many of the ideas in algebra. But our first records of\\npeople really exploring the ideas that are\\nhit upon in algebra come from ancient\\nBabylon around 2000 years before the common\\nera, before Christ. So right around there\\nthere are stone tablets where it looks like\\npeople were exploring some of the fundamental\\nideas of algebra. They weren\\'t using\\nthe same symbols. They weren\\'t using the same ways\\nof representing the numbers, but it was algebra that\\nthey were working on. And that was, once again,\\nin this part of the world. Babylon was right about there. And Babylon, it\\'s kind of\\nkept the tradition of Sumeria. This whole region was\\ncalled Mesopotamia, Greek for between two rivers. But that\\'s the first\\ntraces of people that we know of that\\nwhere people were starting to do what we would\\ncall real, real algebra. And then you fast forward. And I\\'m sure we\\'re\\nmissing-- and I\\'m sure even our historians don\\'t know\\nall of the different instances of people using algebra, but the\\nmajor contributions to algebra, we saw it here in\\nBabylon 2000 years ago. And then if we fast\\nforward to about 200 to 300 AD, so right over there,\\nyou have a Greek gentleman who lived in Alexandria. So this is Greece\\nright over here, but he lived in Alexandria,\\nwhich at the time was part of the Roman Empire. So Alexandria is\\nright over here, and he was a gentleman by\\nthe name of Diophantus, or Diophantus. I don\\'t know how to\\npronounce it, Diophantus. And he is sometimes\\ncredited with being the father of algebra,\\nand it\\'s debatable whether it\\'s Diophantus\\nor al-Khwarizmi. al-Khwarizmi, who\\nkind of started using these terms of\\nbalancing equations and talking about\\nmath in a purer way, while Diophantus was more\\nfocused on particular problems. And both of them were\\nkind of beat to the punch by the Babylonians,\\nalthough they all did contribute in their own way. It\\'s not like they\\nwere just copying what the Babylonians did. They had their own\\nunique contributions to what we now consider algebra. But many, especially\\nWestern historians, associate Diophantus as\\nthe father of algebra. And now, al-Khwarizmi\\nis sometimes what other people would argue\\nas the father of algebra, so he made significant\\ncontributions. And if you go to 600 AD-- so\\nif you go to about 600 AD, another famous mathematician\\nin the history of algebra was Brahmagupta, in India. Brahmagupta, in India. So obviously, and\\nactually, I don\\'t know where in India he lived. I should look that\\nup, but roughly in that part of the world. And he also made\\nsignificant contributions. And then you have\\nal-Khwarizmi, who shows up right\\nthere, al-Khwarizmi. And he is the gentleman\\nthat definitely we credit with the name\\nalgebra, comes from Arabic for restoration, and some\\npeople also consider him to be, if not the father of\\nalgebra, although some people say he is the father, he is\\none of the fathers of algebra because he really started\\nto think about algebra in the abstract sense, devoid\\nof some specific problems and a lot of the way\\na modern mathematician would start to think\\nabout the field.

       "  \"You will hear me use the word abstract a lot so i thought i would actually give you an attempt at a definition, or maybe even more important an intuition of what abstract means and abstract can be an adjective you can have an abstract idea you can have abstract art or it can be a verb you can abstract something abstract the idea from some other idea and you can even have it as a noun you can have an abstract and it tends to, if you use it as a noun the one I tend to associate is the abstract of research paper, which is kind of, distills the essence of the research paper, which is kind of a summary of that paper and the one thing you are going to see regardless of how you what context you use the word abstract there's this kind of notion taking the essence of a real world object whether you use it as a noun, adjective, or a verb so over here we have our real world we have our real world and then over here you have your world of you have ideas and concepts and the general idea behind the abstraction or abstracting something is that you're taking it away from the particular concrete real world and you're going more into the direction of ideas and concepts and probably for me, one of the most tangible ways of thinking about abstraction, which is kind of a contradiction in itself to think of abstraction in a tangible way is things like geometric shapes so if i were to tell you to find me some cubes you might point to a borg vessel right over there a borg vessel you might point to a pair of dice let me draw a pair of dice if you were looking for cubes so you might point to a pair of dice that looks something like that you might point to a Rubik's cube anything you might find there might be a building that looks like a cube it might be a building that looks like a cube or maybe there is a box in your house that is a cube but in your mind you have a general idea of what a cube is like i know a cube when i see one and a general idea is distilling the concept the idea of what a cube is and all of these ideas are very different this is some plastic thing i could hold in my hand these are these white things they aren't even geometrically close to being perfect they have these little divets on the side right over there this is a large borg vessel that you know that doesn't exist yet is a fictional thing that they all have this cubeness to them one of the fun things about geometry so really distill the essence of these real world shapes and we do have this definition in geometry which is an object like this where every side has the exact same length so this is length one and that would be length one that would be length one it doesn't have to be whatever the length of this side is and this dimension then this dimension would be that length and then that dimension is going to be that length and i'm not giving you the rigorous definition but i'm just trying to highlight that there is pure idea of what a cube is of what a cube is and the real world, there is nothing that is actually a perfect cube if you were to get really really close to the die if you were to measure exactly their measurements they won't be exactly the same measurement but the abstract idea is completely the same length as this and this and this and all of the edges are going to have the exact same length so this is going from the concrete the specific from the real world if you consider the 24th or the 25th century, the real world to going to the idea behind it, the general idea and you probably also heard the word abstract in terms of art, like abstract art so this is abstract art and it is the same general idea so if you to look it up in the dictionary you're going to find 20 definitions of the word abstract but it's all, essentially trying to say the same thing abstract art is art that is not focused on trying to paint reality the exact way reality exists if you look at kind of lot of Renaissance art they are skilled at painting figures exactly how they look in the real world but the abstract artist sometimes they're not even trying to represent anything from the real world they are trying to represent a raw idea or a raw expression of color and form and texture and this is a Jackson Pollock painting right over here and i printed out so many things wrong taken by our own Steven Zucker, our art historian and you can see that it's not clear Jackson Pollock is not trying to paint a you know, a dog or horse or anything like that he is painting something that is devoid completely independent of anything that we actually see in physical reality and the word, abstraction, you know, it doesn't just apply on just a pure geometry and art it applies to almost everything we do on a daily basis when we even talk about things when we even use words or use symbols we are essentially abstracting away we're abstracting the essence of something that actually exists in physical reality so if i use the word dog it is a set of symbols that represent something in our mind that we associate with dog we have in our minds kind of the quality of what a dog actually is you know, it has four legs and floppy ears and you enjoy petting it and they're man's or i guess people's best friend you imagine this thing called a dog and it has the essence of dog and when you actually look at dogs in the real world they look very very different type of animals like when you look at a great dane or kind of a super small poodle But we recognize there is an essence of those particulars that we can abstract away and say this is a dog and we abstract it even more by representing these letter symbols that tend to conjure up this image even when we write something as simple as a number so if i write the number five we use it so frequently that to us a number 5 seems kind of like a concrete thing but it 's so abstract it's just a quantity of things i can symbolize like that i could have symbolized 5 like that i could have symbolized 5 in roman numerals like that i could symbolize it like that and in all of these cases they are it is the idea of a quantity of five things five, you know, you could say point me to a five and someone could draw or point you to something like that but they are still pointing you to the symbol of five but it's still an very abstract idea so hopefully this gives you an appreciation for what abstract means as you can tell, you know it's kind of a, for lack of a better word it's kind of an abstract idea not to be too cute about that \"),\n",

       "  'Before we get into\\nthe meat of algebra, I wanted to give you a quote\\nfrom one of the greatest minds in human history, Galileo\\nGalilei, because I think this quote encapsulates\\nthe true point of algebra and really mathematics\\nin general. He said, \"Philosophy is written\\nin that great book which ever lies before our eyes--\\nI mean the universe-- but we cannot understand\\nit if we do not first learn the language and grasp the\\nsymbols in which is written. This book is written in\\nthe mathematical language, without which one wanders in\\nvain through a dark labyrinth.\" So very dramatic, but very deep. And this really is the\\npoint of mathematics. And what we\\'ll see as we start\\ngetting deeper and deeper into algebra is that we\\'re going\\nto start abstracting things, and we\\'re going to start\\ngetting to core ideas that start explaining really how\\nthe universe is structured. Sure, these ideas can be\\napplied to things like economics and finance and\\nphysics and chemistry. But at their core,\\nthey\\'re the same idea, and so they\\'re even more\\nfundamental, more pure, than any one of\\nthose applications. And to see what I mean by\\ngetting down to the root idea, let\\'s go with a-- I guess we\\nstarted with the very grand, the philosophy of\\nthe universe is written in mathematics--\\nbut let\\'s start with a very concrete,\\nsimple idea. But we\\'ll keep\\nabstracting, and we\\'ll see how the same idea\\nconnects across many domains in our universe. So let\\'s just say\\nwe\\'re at the store, and we\\'re going\\nto buy something. And there is a sale. The sale says that it\\nis 30% percent off, and I\\'m interested. I don\\'t shop at\\ntoo fancy a store. So let\\'s say I\\'m interested\\nin a pair of pants. And the pair of pants before\\nthe sale even is about $20. And that is about how\\nmuch I spend on my pants. So I\\'m interested in\\na $20 pair of pants. But it\\'s even better, there\\'s\\na 30% off sale on these pants. Well, how would I\\nthink about how much I\\'m going to get\\noff of that $20? And this isn\\'t algebra yet. This is something that you\\'ve\\nprobably had exposure to. You would multiply\\nthe 30% times the $20. So you would say your\\ndiscount is equal to-- you could write\\nit as 30% times $20. I\\'ll do the $20 in purple. Or you could write it, if\\nyou wanted to write this as a decimal, you could\\nwrite this as 0.30 times $20. And if you were to do the\\nmath, you would get $6. So nothing new over there. But what if I want to\\ngeneralize it a little bit? That\\'s the discount on this\\nparticular pair of pants. But what if I wanted to know\\nthe discount on anything in the store? Well, then I could\\nsay, well, let x be the price-- let me do\\nthis in a different color. So I\\'m just going\\nto make a symbol. Let x be the price\\nof the product I want to buy, price,\\nthe non-discount price of the product in the store. So now, all of a\\nsudden, we can say that our discount is\\nequal to 30% times x. Or if we wanted to\\nwrite it as a decimal, if we wanted to write\\n30% as a decimal, we could write 0.30 times x. Now, this is interesting. Now you give me the price\\nof any product in the store, and I can substitute\\nit in for x. And then I can essentially\\nmultiply 0.3 times that, and I would get the discount. So now we\\'re starting\\nto, very slowly, we\\'re starting to get into\\nthe abstraction of algebra. And we\\'ll see that these will\\nget much more nuanced and deep and, frankly, more\\nbeautiful as we start studying more and more\\nkind of algebraic ideas. But we aren\\'t done here. We can abstract this even more. Over here, we\\'ve said\\nwe\\'ve generalized this for any product. We\\'re not just saying\\nfor this $20 product. If there\\'s a $10 product, we\\ncan put that $10 product in here for x. And then we would\\nsay 0.30 times 10, and the discount would be $3. It might be $100 product, then\\nthe discount would be $30. But let\\'s generalize even more. Let\\'s say, well, what is\\nthe discount for any given sale when the sale is\\na certain percentage? So now we can say\\nthat the discount-- let me define a variable. So let\\'s let m equal-- or I\\'ll\\nsay p just so it makes sense. p is equal to the\\npercentage off. Now what can we do? Well, now we can say\\nthat the discount is equal to the percentage off. In these other examples,\\nwe were picking 30%. But we can say now it\\'s p. It\\'s the percentage off. It\\'s p. That\\'s the percentage off\\ntimes the product in question, times the price, the\\nnon-discount price of the product in question. Well, that was x. The discount is\\nequal to p times x. Now, this is really interesting. Now we have a general\\nway of calculating a discount for any given\\npercentage off and any given product x. And we didn\\'t have to use\\nthese words and these letters. We could have said let\\ny equal the discount. Then we could have written\\nthe same underlying idea. Instead of writing\\ndiscount, we could have written y is equal to\\nthe percentage off p times the non-discount price\\nof the product, times x. And you could have defined these\\nletters any way you wanted. Instead of writing\\ny there, you could have written a\\nGreek letter, or you could have written\\nany symbol there. As long as you can\\nkeep track of it, that symbol represents the\\nactual dollar discount. But now things get\\nreally interesting. Because we can use this type\\nof a relationship, which is an equation--\\nyou\\'re equating y to this right over here, that\\'s\\nwhy we call it an equation-- this can be used for\\nthings that are completely unrelated to the price,\\nthe discount price, at the store over here. So in physics,\\nyou\\'ll see that force is equal to mass\\ntimes acceleration. The letters are different,\\nbut these are fundamentally the same idea. We could\\'ve let y is equal to\\nforce, and mass is equal to p. So let me write p\\nis equal to mass. And this wouldn\\'t be an\\nintuitive way to define it, but I want to show\\nyou that this is the same idea, the\\nsame relationship, but it\\'s being applied to two\\ncompletely different things. And we could say x is\\nequal to acceleration. Well, then the famous force\\nis equal to mass times acceleration can be rewritten. And it\\'s really\\nthe same exact idea as y, which we\\'ve\\ndefined as force, can be equal to\\nmass, which we\\'re going to use the\\nsymbol p, which is equal to p times acceleration. And we\\'re just going to happen\\nto use the letter x here, times x. Well, this is the\\nexact same equation. This is the exact same equation. And we could see that we\\ncan take this equation, and it can apply to\\nthings in economics, or it can apply to\\nthings in finance, or it can apply to things in\\ncomputer science, or logic, or electrical engineering,\\nor anything, accounting. There\\'s an infinite\\nnumber of applications of this one equation. And what\\'s neat\\nabout mathematics and what\\'s neat about\\nalgebra in particular is we can focus on\\nthis abstraction. We can focus on\\nthe abstract here, and we can manipulate\\nthe abstract here. And what we discover\\nfrom these ideas, from these\\nmanipulations, can then go and be reapplied to all\\nof these other applications, to all of them. And even neater, it\\'s\\nkind of telling us the true structure\\nof the universe if you were to strip away all\\nof these human definitions and all of these\\nhuman applications. So for example, we could say,\\nlook, if y is equal to p times x-- so literally, if someone\\nsaid, hey, this is y, and someone says, on the\\nother hand, I have p times x, I could say, well, you\\nhave the same thing in both of your hands. And if you were to divide\\none of them by a number, and if you wanted them\\nto still be equal, you would divide the\\nother one by that number. So for example, we know that\\ny is equal to p times x. Well, what if you wanted\\nto have them both be equal? And you say, well,\\nwhat is y divided by x going to be equal to? Well, y was equal to p\\ntimes x, so y divided by x is going to be\\nthe same thing as p times x divided by x. But now this is interesting. Because p times x\\ndivided by x-- well, if you multiply by something and\\nthen divide by that something, it\\'s just you\\'re going to\\nget your original number. If you multiply by\\n5 and divide by 5, you\\'re just going to start with\\np or whatever this number is. So those would cancel out. But we were able to manipulate\\nthe abstraction here and get y over x is equal to p-- and\\nlet me make that x green. And now this has implications\\nfor every one of these ideas. One is telling us\\na fundamental truth about the universe,\\nalmost devoid of any of these applications. But now we can go and take\\nthem back to any place that we applied. And the really\\ninteresting thing is we\\'re going to find there\\nare an infinite number of applications,\\nand we don\\'t even know, frankly, most of them. We\\'re going to discover new ones\\nfor them in a thousand years. And so hopefully this\\ngives you a sense for why Galileo said\\nwhat he said about really mathematics is really the\\nlanguage with which we can understand the philosophy\\nof the universe. And that\\'s why people tell us\\nthat if a completely alien life form were to ever\\ncontact humans, mathematics would probably\\nbe our first common ground, the place that we can start\\nto form a basis that we can start to communicate from.

       "  \"I'm here with Jesse Ro, whose a math teacher at Summit San Jose and a Khan Academy teaching fellow and you had some interesting ideas or questions. Yeah, one question that students ask a lot when they start Algebra is why do we need letters, why can't we just use numbers for everything? Why letters? So why do we have all these Xs and Ys and Zs and ABCs when we start dealing with Algebra? Yeah, exactly. That's interesting, well why don't we let people think about that for a second. So Sal, how would you answer this question? Why do we need letters in Algebra? So why letters. So there are a couple of ways I'd think about it. One is if you have an unknown. So if I were to write X plus three is equal to ten the reason why we're doing this is that we don't know what X is It's literally an unknown. And so we're going to solve for it in some way. But it did not have to be the letter X. We could have literally written blank plus three is equal to ten. Or we could have written Question Mark plus three is equal to ten. So it didn't have to be letters, but we needed some type of symbol. It literally could've been Smiley Face plus three is equal to ten. But until you know it, you need some type of a symbol to represent whatever that number is. Now we can go and solve this equation and then know what that symbol represents. But if we knew it ahead of time, it wouldn't be an unknown. It wouldn't be something that we didn't know. So that's one reason why I would use letters and where just numbers by itself wouldn't be helpful. The other is when you're describing relationships between numbers. So I could do something like - I could say - that whenever you give me a three, I'm going to give you a four. And I could say, if you give me a five, I'm going to give you a six. And i could keep going on and on forever. If you give me a 7.1, I'm going to give you an 8.1. And I could keep listing this on and on forever. Maybe you could give me any number, and I could tell you what I'm going to give you. But I would obviously run out of space and time if I were to list all of them. And we could do that much more elegantly if we used letters to describe the relationship. Maybe what you give me we call X, and what I give you we call Y. And so I say, look, whatever you give me, I'm going to add one to it. And that's what I'm going to give back to you. And so now, this very simple equation here can describe an infinite number of relationships between X or an infinite number of corresponding Ys and Xs. So now someone knows whatever X you give me you give me three, I add one to it, and I'm going to give you four. You give me 7.1, I'm going to add one to it and give you 8.1. So there is no more elegant way that you could've done it than by using symbols. With that said, I didn't have to use Xs and Ys. This is just a convention that kind of comes to use from history. I could've defined what you give me as Star and what I give you as Smiley Face and this also would've been a valid way to express this. So the letters are really just symbols. Nothing more. \"),\n",

       "  'This right here is a\\npicture of Rene Descartes. Once again, one\\nof the great minds in both math and philosophy. And I think you\\'re seeing\\na little bit of a trend here, that the great\\nphilosophers were also great mathematicians\\nand vice versa. And he was somewhat of a\\ncontemporary of Galileo. He was 32 years younger,\\nalthough he died shortly after Galileo died. This guy died at a\\nmuch younger age. Galileo was well into his 70s. Descartes died at what\\nis only 54 years old. And he\\'s probably most known in\\npopular culture for this quote right over here, a\\nvery philosophical quote. \"I think,\\ntherefore I am.\" But I also wanted to throw in,\\nand this isn\\'t that related to algebra, but I just thought\\nit was a really neat quote, probably his least famous\\nquote, this one right over here. And I like it just because\\nit\\'s very practical, and it makes you realize\\nthat these great minds, these pillars of\\nphilosophy and mathematics, at the end of the day, they\\nreally were just human beings. And he said, \"You\\njust keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake\\nthat could be made. But I just kept pushing.\" Which I think is very,\\nvery good life advice. Now, he did many things in\\nphilosophy and mathematics. But the reason why\\nI\\'m including him here as we build our\\nfoundations of algebra is that he is the\\nindividual most responsible for a very strong connection\\nbetween algebra and geometry. So on the left over here, you\\nhave the world of algebra, and we\\'ve discussed\\nit a little bit. You have equations\\nthat deal with symbols, and these symbols\\nare essentially they can take on values. So you could have something\\nlike y is equal to 2x minus 1. This gives us a relationship\\nbetween whatever x is and whatever y is. And we can even set up a table\\nhere and pick values for x and see what the\\nvalues of y would be. And I could just pick\\nrandom values for x, and then figure out what y is. But I\\'ll pick relatively\\nstraightforward values just so that the math\\ndoesn\\'t get too complicated. So for example, if\\nx is negative 2, then y is going to\\nbe 2 times negative 2 minus 1, which is negative 4\\nminus 1, which is negative 5. If x is negative\\n1, then y is going to be 2 times negative\\n1 minus 1, which is equal to-- this is negative\\n2 minus 1, which is negative 3. If x is equal to 0, then y is\\ngoing to be 2 times 0 minus 1. 2 times 0 is 0 minus\\n1 is just negative 1. I\\'ll do a couple more. And I could have\\npicked any values here. I could have said,\\nwell, what happens if x is the negative\\nsquare root of 2, or what happens if x is\\nnegative 5/2, or positive 6/7? But I\\'m just picking\\nthese numbers because it makes the\\nmath a lot easier when I try to figure out\\nwhat y is going to be. But when x is 1, y is going\\nto be 2 times 1 minus 1. 2 times 1 is 2 minus 1 is 1. And I\\'ll do one more. I\\'ll do one more in a color\\nthat I have not used yet. Let\\'s see, this purple. If x is 2, then y is\\ngoing to be 2 times 2-- now our x is 2-- minus 1. So that is 4 minus\\n1 is equal to 3. So fair enough. I just kind of sampled\\nthis relationship. I said, OK, this describes\\nthe general relationship between a variable\\ny and a variable x. And then I just made it a\\nlittle bit more concrete. I said, OK, well, then\\nfor each of these values of x, what would be the\\ncorresponding value of y? And what Descartes\\nrealized is is that you could visualize this. One, you could visualize\\nthese individual points, but that could also\\nhelp you, in general, to visualize this relationship. And so what he\\nessentially did is he bridged the worlds\\nof this kind of very abstract, symbolic algebra\\nand that and geometry, which was concerned with\\nshapes and sizes and angles. So over here you have\\nthe world of geometry. And obviously, there are people\\nin history, maybe many people, who history may have forgotten\\nwho might have dabbled in this. But before Descartes,\\nit\\'s generally viewed that geometry\\nwas Euclidean geometry, and that\\'s essentially the\\ngeometry that you studied in a geometry class in\\neighth or ninth grade or 10th grade in a traditional\\nhigh school curriculum. And that\\'s the\\ngeometry of studying the relationships between\\ntriangles and their angles, and the relationships between\\ncircles and you have radii, and then you have triangles\\ninscribed in circles, and all the rest. And we go into some depth in\\nthat in the geometry playlist. But Descartes\\nsaid, well, I think I can represent this visually\\nthe same way that you could with studying these\\ntriangles and these circles. He said, well, if we\\nview a piece of paper, if we think about a\\ntwo-dimensional plane, you could view a\\npiece of paper as kind of a section of a\\ntwo-dimensional plane. And we call it two\\ndimensions because there\\'s two directions that\\nyou could go in. There\\'s the up/down direction. That\\'s one direction. So let me draw that. I\\'ll do it in blue because we\\'re\\nstarting to visualize things, so I\\'ll do it in\\nthe geometry color. So you have the\\nup/down direction. And you have the\\nleft/right direction. That\\'s why it\\'s called\\na two-dimensional plane. If we\\'re dealing in\\nthree dimensions, you would have an\\nin/out dimension. And it\\'s very easy to do\\ntwo dimensions on the screen because the screen\\nis two dimensional. And he, says, well, you know,\\nthere are two variables here, and they have this relationship. So why don\\'t I associate\\neach of these variables with one of these\\ndimensions over here? And by convention, let\\'s make\\nthe y variable, which is really the dependent variable--\\nthe way we did it, it depends on what x is-- let\\'s\\nput that on the vertical axis. And let\\'s put our\\nindependent variable, the one where I just\\nrandomly picked values for it to see what y\\nwould become, let\\'s put that on the horizontal axis. And it actually\\nwas Descartes who came up with the convention of\\nusing x\\'s and y\\'s, and we\\'ll see later z\\'s, in\\nalgebra so extensively as unknown variables\\nor the variables that you\\'re manipulating. But he says, well, if we\\nthink about it this way, if we number these\\ndimensions-- so let\\'s say that in the x direction,\\nlet\\'s make this right over here is negative 3. Let\\'s make this negative 2. This is negative 1. This is 0. Now, I\\'m just numbering\\nthe x direction, the left/right direction. Now this is positive 1. This is positive 2. This is positive 3. And we could do the\\nsame in the y direction. So let\\'s see, so this could be,\\nlet\\'s say this is negative 5, negative 4, negative\\n3, negative-- actually, let me do it a little\\nbit neater than that. Let me clean this\\nup a little bit. So let me erase this\\nand extend this down a little bit so I can go all\\nthe way down to negative 5 without making it\\nlook too messy. So let\\'s go all\\nthe way down here. And so we can number it. This is 1. This is 2. This is 3. And then this could be\\nnegative 1, negative 2. And these are all\\njust conventions. It could have been\\nlabeled the other way. We could\\'ve decided to put\\nthe x there and the y there and make this the\\npositive direction and make this the\\nnegative direction. But this is just the\\nconvention that people adopted starting with Descartes. Negative 2, negative 3,\\nnegative 4, and negative 5. And he says, well, I\\nthink I can associate each of these pairs of values\\nwith a point in two dimensions. I can take the x-coordinate, I\\ncan take the x value right over here, and I say, OK,\\nthat\\'s a negative 2. That would be right over there\\nalong the left/right direction. I\\'m going to the left\\nbecause it\\'s negative. And that\\'s associated\\nwith negative 5 in the vertical direction. So I say the y\\nvalue is negative 5, and so if I go 2 to\\nthe left and 5 down, I get to this point\\nright over there. So he says, these two values,\\nnegative 2 and negative 5, I can associate it with\\nthis point in this plane right over here, in this\\ntwo-dimensional plane. So I\\'ll say that point has\\nthe coordinates, tells me where to find that point,\\nnegative 2, negative 5. And these coordinates are\\ncalled Cartesian coordinates, named for Rene\\nDescartes because he\\'s the guy that came up with these. He\\'s associating, all of a\\nsudden, these relationships with points on a\\ncoordinate plane. And then he said, well,\\nOK, let\\'s do another one. There\\'s this other\\nrelationship, where I have when x is\\nequal to negative 1, y is equal to negative 3. So x is negative\\n1, y is negative 3. That\\'s that point\\nright over there. And the convention\\nis, once again, when you list the\\ncoordinates, you list the x-coordinate,\\nthen the y-coordinate. And that\\'s just what\\npeople decided to do. Negative 1, negative\\n3, that would be that point right over there. And then you have the point\\nwhen x is 0, y is negative 1. When x is 0 right\\nover here, which means I don\\'t go to the left\\nor the right, y is negative 1, which means I go 1 down. So that\\'s that point\\nright over there, 0, negative 1, right over there. And I could keep doing this. When x is 1, y is 1. When x is 2, y is 3. Actually, let me do it in\\nthat same purple color. When x is 2, y is 3, 2 comma 3. And then this one right over\\nhere in orange was 1 comma 1. And this is neat by itself. I essentially just\\nsampled possible x\\'s. But what he realized\\nis, not only do you sample these possible\\nx\\'s, but if you just kept sampling x\\'s, if you\\ntried sampling all the x\\'s in between, you would actually\\nend up plotting out a line. So if you were to\\ndo every possible x, you would end up getting a\\nline that looks something like that right over there. And any relation, if you\\npick any x and find any y, it really represents\\na point on this line. Or another way to think about\\nit, any point on this line represents a solution to this\\nequation right over here. So if you have this\\npoint right over here, which looks like it\\'s about\\nx is 1 and 1/2, y is 2. So me write that, 1.5 comma 2. That is a solution\\nto this equation. When x is 1.5, 2 times\\n1.5 is 3 minus 1 is 2. That is right over there. So all of a sudden,\\nhe was able to bridge this gap or this relationship\\nbetween algebra and geometry. We can now visualize\\nall of the x and y pairs that satisfy this\\nequation right over here. And so he is responsible\\nfor making this bridge, and that\\'s why the\\ncoordinates that we use to specify these points are\\ncalled Cartesian coordinates. And as we\\'ll see, the first\\ntype of equations we will study are equations of\\nthis form over here. And in a traditional\\nalgebra curriculum, they\\'re called linear equations. And you might be saying,\\nwell, OK, this is an equation. I see that this\\nis equal to that. But what\\'s so linear about them? What makes them\\nlook like a line? And to realize why\\nthey are linear, you have to make this jump\\nthat Rene Descartes made, because if you were to plot\\nthis using Cartesian coordinates on a Euclidean plane,\\nyou will get a line. And in the future,\\nwe\\'ll see that there\\'s other types of equations where\\nyou won\\'t get a line, where you\\'ll get a curve or something\\nkind of crazy or funky. '),\n",

       "  \"Let's say that I'm\\nworking in a restaurant, and I'm making $10 per hour. But on top of my hourly wage,\\nI also get tips each hour. So this entire expression,\\nyou can view this as how much I might\\nmake in a given hour. Now, you might also realize\\nthat the number of tips or the amount of tips\\nI might make in an hour can change dramatically\\nfrom hour to hour. It can vary-- one hour it\\nmight be lunchtime, get a lot of tips, people might\\nget some big-ticket items. The next hour, I might\\nnot have any customers. And then my tips\\nmight be really low. So the tips part\\nright over here, we consider that--\\nthe entire word, we consider that\\nto be a variable. From scenario to\\nscenario, it can change. So for example, in one\\nscenario, maybe it's lunchtime. I'm getting really big tips. So tips is-- let's\\nsay it's equal to $30. And so the total amount I\\nmight make in that hour-- we can go back to this\\nexpression right over here-- it's going to be 10 plus--\\ninstead of writing tips here, I'll write 30 because that's\\nwhat my tips are in that hour. And so that is going\\nto be equal to 40. Let me do it in\\nthat yellow color. It's going to be equal to $40. But let's say right after that,\\nthe restaurant slows down. We're out of the lunch\\nhour for whatever reason. Maybe the restaurant next door\\nhas a big sale or something. And so the next hour, my\\ntips go down dramatically. My tips go down to\\n$5 for that hour. Now I go back to\\nthis expression. The total I make\\nis my hourly wage plus the $5 in tips,\\nwhich is equal to $15. As you see, this entire\\nexpression-- the 10 plus tips-- it changed depending on what the\\nvalue of the variable tips is. Now, you won't see whole\\nwords typically used in algebra as variables. We get lazy. And so instead, we tend to use\\njust easier-to-write symbols. And so in this context,\\ninstead of writing tips, maybe we could have\\njust written 10 plus t, where t represents the tips\\nthat we get in an hour. And so then we\\nwould say, OK, what happens when t is equal to 30? Well, then, we have a situation. t is equal to 30. This evaluates to 10 plus\\n30, which would be 40. What would happen\\nif t is equal to 5? Well, then, this would\\nevaluate to 10 plus 5, which is equal to 15. Now, I want to be clear. We didn't even have to use t. We didn't even really\\nhave to use a letter, although in traditional algebra,\\nyou almost do use a letter. We could have written\\nit as 10 plus x, where x is your tips per hour.\\nx might not be as natural. It's not the first\\nletter in the word tips. Or you could have even\\nwritten 10 plus star, where you could\\nsay star represents the number of tips in an hour. But it just might have not\\nmade as much intuitive sense. But hopefully this\\ngives you a general idea of just what a variable is. All it is is a symbol that\\nrepresents varying values. And that's why we\\ncall it a variable. \"),\n",

       "  'We now hopefully know a little about variables and as we covered in the last video, a variable can be really any symbol, although we typically use letters because we\\'re used to writing and typing letters. But it can be anything from an x, to a y, a z, an a, a b, and oftentimes we start using greek letters like theta. But you can really use any symbol to say Hey, this is going to vary You can take on multiple values But out of all of all of these The one that is most typically used in algebra Or really in all of mathematics is the variable \"x\" Although all of these are used to some degree But given that x is used so heavily it does introduce a slight problem. And that problem is that it looks a lot like the multiplication symbol Or the one that we use in arithmetic So in arithmetic if I want to write 2 x 3 I literally write \"2 x 3\" But now that we are starting to use variables, if I want to write \"2 times x\" Well if I use this as the multiplication symbol it would be 2 times x And the times symbol and the X look awfully similar and if I\\'m not really careful with my penmanship it can get very confusing. Is this \"Two x x\"? Is this \"two times times something\"? What exactly is going on here? And because this is confusing, This, right over here, is extremely confusing And it can be misinterpreted, We tend not to use this multiplication symbol When we are doing algebra Instead of that, to represent multiplication, We have several options. Instead of writing two times x this way, we could write 2 dot x. And this dot, I want to be very clear, This is not a decimal This is just written a little bit higher And we write this so we don\\'t get confusion in between this and one of these variables right here. But this can really be interpreted as \"2 times x\" So for example, if someone says 2 dot x, when x is equal to 3, well this would be the same thing as two times three, when x is equal to three. Another way you could write it is You could write \"2\" and then you could write the x in parentheses right next to it. This is also interpreted as 2 times x Once again, so in this situation If \"x\" were seven, this would be two times seven, or fourteen And the most traditional way of doing it is to just write the x right after the 2. And sometimes this will be read as \"2x\" But this literally does mean \"Two times x\" And you might say, how come we didn\\'t always do that? Well it would be literally confusing if we did it over here. Instead of writing \"2 times 3\" And wrote \"2 3\" Well, that looks like \"23\". This doesn\\'t look like two times three And this is why we never did it. But here, since we\\'re using a letter now, It\\'s clear that this isn\\'t a part of that number. This isn\\'t \"twenty something\" This is two times this variable x. So all of these are really the same expression. Two times x, two times x, and two times x. And so with that out of the way Let\\'s try some few worked examples, a few practice problems And this will hopefully prepare you for the next exercise Where you\\'ll get a lot of chances to practice this. So if I where to say \"what is 10 minus three y\" And what does this equal when \"y\" is equal to two Well, every time you see the \"y\" You\\'d want that 2 there So this is y is equal to 2. Let\\'s set that y equal to two This is the same thing as 10 minus three times two You do the multiplication first. Multiplication takes precedence in order of operations So three times two is six, Ten minus six is equal to four. Let\\'s do another one. Let\\'s say we had \"7x minus 4\" And we want to evaluate that when when x is equal to three. Where we see the x, we want to put the 3 there So this is the same thing as \"7 times 3\" And I\\'ll actually use this notation, so seven times three minus four. And once again, multiplication takes precedence by order of operations, over addition or subtraction So we want to do the multiplying first 7 times 3 is 21 21 minus 4 is equal to 17. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of background, and I really encourage you to try the next exercise, It will give you a lot of practice on being to evaluate expressions like this. '),\n",

So it's gonna be minus, we\\nhave this minus out here, so minus two. And what is this going to be? Well, let's think about it. 3.5 plus five is 8.5, minus two is going to be 6.5. So this is equal to this, is equal to 6.5. Let's do another one of these. Alright. And we'll, just like before, try to work through it on your own before we do it together. Alright, now let's do it together. So over here I have this expression 0.1 M plus eight minus 12 N, when M is equal to 30\\nand N is equal to 1/4. Alright. So everywhere I see an M I\\nwant to replace with a 30. And everywhere I see an N I\\nwant to replace with a 1/4. So this is going to be equal to 0.1 times M. M is 30. Times 30 plus eight minus 12 times N, where N is 1/4. N is 1/4. So what is, what is 1/10, This right over here,\\n0.1, that's the same thing as 1/10 of 30? Well 1/10 of 30, that's going to be three. So this part is three. And we have three plus eight. And then we're gonna have minus. Well what is 12 times 1/4? That's gonna be 12/4,\\nor 12 divided by four, which is going to be equal to three. And now when we evaluate this, so that is equal to this, we have three plus eight minus three. Well, threes are going to, you know positive three, then\\nyou're gonna subtract three, and you're just going to be left with, you're just going to\\nbe left with an eight. And you're done. This expression when M is equal\\nto 30 and N is equal to 1/4 is equal to eight. \"),\n",

And this might seem\\na little bit obvious, but how many Chuck\\nNorrises do I now have? Well, 2 Chuck Norrises,\\nwe can represent this as literally a Chuck\\nNorris plus a Chuck Norris. So let me do that,\\na Chuck Norris plus another Chuck\\nNorris, 2 Chuck Norrises. You could also do this\\n2 times Chuck Norris, and this is just another\\nway of representing it. And 3 Chuck Norrises-- you\\ncould do that as a Chuck Norris plus a Chuck Norris plus\\nanother Chuck Norris. And so we would\\nhave a grand total-- and this might be\\nvery simple for you. But you would have a\\ngrand total of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Chuck Norrises. So this would be equal\\nto 5 Chuck Norrises. Now, let's get a little\\nbit more abstract here. Chuck Norris is a\\nvery tangible thing. So let's go to a\\nlittle bit more of traditional algebraic notation. If I have 2x's and\\nremember, you could do this as 2x's or 2 times x. And to that, I would add\\n3x's How many x's do I have? Well, once again,\\n2x's, that's 2 times x. You could do that\\nas an x plus an x. We don't know what\\nthe value of x is. But whatever that value is,\\nwe can add it to itself. And then 3x's are they're\\ngoing to be that value. Let me do that in\\nthat same green color. 3x's are going to be that\\nvalue plus that value plus whatever that value is. And so how many\\nx's do I now have? Well, I'm going to\\nhave 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 x's. So 2x plus 3x is equal to 5x. And if you think about it, all\\nwe really did-- and hopefully, you conceptually\\nget it-- is we just added the 2 numbers that\\nwere multiplying the x. And these numbers, the 2 or the\\n3, they're called coefficients. Very fancy word, but it's\\njust this constant number, this regular number that's\\nmultiplied by the variable. You just added the 2 and\\nthe 3, to get your 5x. Now, let's think about\\nthis a little bit more. Let's go back to this original\\nexpression, the 2 Chuck Norrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises. Let's say, to that,\\nwe were to add to some type of a-- let's we\\nwere to add 7 plums over here. So this is my drawing of a plum. So we have 7 plums plus 2 Chuck\\nNorrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises. And let's say that I\\nadd another 2 plums. I add another 2 plums here. So what this whole thing be? Well, I wouldn't add the 7\\nto the 2 to the 3 plus the 2. We're adding\\ndifferent things here. You have 2 Chuck Norrises\\nand 3 Chuck Norrises, so they're still going to\\nsimplify to 5 Chuck Norrises. . And then we would separately\\nthink about the plums. We have 7 plums, and we're\\nadding another 2 plums. We're going to have 9 plums. Plus 9 plums, so this simplifies\\nto five Chuck Norrises and 9 plums. Similarly, over here,\\ninstead of just 2x plus 3x, if I had 7y plus 2x plus 3x\\nplus 2y, what do I now have? Well, I can't add the\\nx's and the y's. They could very well\\nrepresent a different number. So all I can do is\\nreally add the x's. And then I get the 5x. And then, I'd\\nseparately add the y. If I have 7y's and to that I add\\n2y's, I'm going to have 9y's. If I have 7 of something\\nand I add 2 of something, I now have 9 of that something. So I'm going to have 9y's. So you add that. Do that in a different color. You add this and this. You get that. You add the x's. You get that right over there. So hopefully, that\\nmakes a little sense. Actually I'll throw\\nout one more idea. So given this, what would happen\\nif I were to have 2x plus 1 plus 7x plus 5? Well, once again,\\nyou might be tempted to add the 2 plus\\nthe 1, but they're adding different things. These are 2x's. This is just the number 1. So you really just have\\nto add the x's together. So you're going to\\nsay, well, I got 2x's. And I'm going to\\nadd 7x's to that. Well, that means\\nI now have 9x's. And then, separately,\\nyou'd say, well, I've got just the\\nabstract number 1. And then I've got another 5. 1 plus 5 is going\\nto be equal to 6. \"),\n",

       "  \"I've gotten feedback\\nthat all the Chuck Norris imagery in the last video might\\nhave been a little bit too overwhelming. So for this video, I've included\\nsomething a little bit more soothing. Let's try to simplify\\nsome more expressions. And we'll see we're\\njust applying ideas that we already knew about. Let's say I want to simplify the\\nexpression 2 times 3x plus 5. Well, this literally\\nmeans two 3x plus 5's. So this is the exact same thing. This is one 3x plus\\n5, and then to that, I'm going to add\\nanother 3x plus 5. This is literally what\\n2 times 3x plus 5 means. Well, this is the same thing\\nas, if we just look at it right over here, we have now two 3x's. So we could write\\nit as 2 times 3x. Plus, we have two 5's,\\nso plus 2 times 5. You might say, hey, Sal, isn't\\nthis just the distributive property that I know\\nfrom arithmetic? I've essentially just\\ndistributed the 2? 2 times 3x plus 2 times 5? And I would tell\\nyou, yes, it is. And the whole reason why I'm\\ndoing this is just to show you that it is exactly\\nwhat you already know. But with that out of the way,\\nlet's continue to simplify it. When you multiply the 2\\ntimes the 3x, you get 6x. When you multiply the 2\\ntimes the 5, you get 10. So this simplified\\nto 6x plus 10. Now let's try something that's\\na little bit more involved. Once again, really just\\nthings that you already know. Let's say I had 7 times 3y minus\\n5 minus 2 times 10 plus 4y. Let's see if we\\ncan simplify this. Well, let's work on\\nthe left-hand side of the expression, the\\n7 times 3y minus 5. We just have to\\ndistribute the 7. This is going to be 7 times 3y,\\nwhich is going to give us 21y. Or if I had 3 y's\\n7 times, that's going to be 21 y's, either way\\nyou want to think about it. And then I have 7\\ntimes-- we've got to be careful with\\nthe sign-- negative 5. 7 times negative\\n5 is negative 35. So we've simplified\\nthis part of it. Let's simplify the\\nright-hand side. You might be tempted to say,\\noh, 2 times 10 and 2 times 4y and then subtract them. And if you do that right and\\nyou distribute the subtraction, it would work out. But I like think of\\nthis as negative 2, and we're going to\\ndistribute the negative 2 times 10 and the\\nnegative 2 times 4y. So negative 2 times\\n10 is negative 20, so it's minus 20\\nright over here. And then negative 2 times\\n4, negative 2 times 4 is negative 8, so it's\\ngoing to be negative 8y. Let's write a minus\\n8y right over here. And are we done simplifying? Well, no, there's a little\\nbit more that we can do. We can't add the 21y to the\\nnegative 35 or the negative 20 because these are\\nadding different things or subtracting different things. But we do have two things\\nthat are multiplying y. Let me do all in\\nthis green color. You have 21 y's right over here. And then we can view it as from\\nthat we are subtracting 8 y's. So if I have 21 of something\\nand I take 8 of them away, I'm left with 13\\nof that something. So those are going to\\nsimplify to 13 y's. I'll do this in a new color. And then I have\\nnegative 35 minus 20. That's just going to\\nsimplify to negative 55. So this whole thing\\nsimplified, using a little bit of the distributive\\nproperty and combining similar or like terms,\\nwe got to 13y minus 55. \"),\n",

       "  \"Now we have a very, very,\\nvery hairy expression. And once again, I'm going to\\nsee if you can simplify this. And I'll give you\\nlittle time to do it. So this one is even crazier than\\nthe last few we've looked at. We've got y's and\\nxy's, and x squared and x's, well more just xy's and\\ny squared and on and on and on. And there will be a temptation,\\nbecause you see a y here and a y here to\\nsay, oh, maybe I can add this negative\\n3y plus this 4xy somehow since I see a y and a y. But the important\\nthing to realize here is that a y is\\ndifferent than an xy. Think about it\\nthey were numbers. If y was 3 and an x was a\\n2, then a y would be a 3 while an xy would have been a 6. And a y is very different\\nthan a y squared. Once again, if the why it\\ntook on the value 3, then the y squared would\\nbe the value 9. So even though you see\\nthe same letter here, they aren't the same-- I\\nguess you cannot add these two or subtract these two terms. A y is different\\nthan a y squared, is different than an xy. Now with that said, let's\\nsee if there is anything that we can simplify. So first, let's think\\nabout the y terms. So you have a negative 3y there. Do we have any more y term? Yes, we do. We have this 2y\\nright over there. So I'll just write it\\nout-- I'll just reorder it. So we have negative 3y plus 2y. Now, let's think\\nabout-- and I'm just going in an arbitrary order,\\nbut since our next term is an xy term-- let's think about\\nall of the xy terms. So we have plus 4xy\\nright over here. So let me just write\\nit down-- I'm just reordering the whole\\nexpression-- plus 4xy. And then I have minus\\n4xy right over here. Then let's go to\\nthe x squared terms. I have negative 2 times x\\nsquared, or minus 2x squared. So let's look at this. So I have minus 2x squared. Do I have any other x squared? Yes, I do. I have this 3x squared\\nright over there. So plus 3x squared. And then let's see, I have\\nan x term right over here, and that actually looks\\nlike the only x term. So that's plus 2x. And then I only\\nhave one y squared term-- I'll circle that in\\norange-- so plus y squared. So all I have done is I've\\nreordered the statement and I've color coded it based\\non the type of term we have. And now it should be\\na little bit simpler. So let's try it out. If I have negative\\n3 of something plus 2 of that something,\\nwhat do I have? Or another way to say it,\\nif I have two of something and I subtract 3 of that,\\nwhat am I left with? Well, I'm left with negative\\n1 of that something. So I could write negative 1y, or\\nI could just write negative y. And another way you\\ncould think about it, but I like to think about\\nit intuitively more, is what's the coefficient here? It is negative 3. What's the coefficient here? It's 2. Where obviously\\nboth are dealing-- they're both y\\nterms, not xy terms, not y squared terms, just y. And so negative 3\\nplus 2 is negative 1, or negative 1y is the\\nsame thing as negative y. So those simplify to\\nthis right over here. Now let's look at the xy terms. If I have 4 of\\nthis, 4 xy's and I were to take away 4 xy's,\\nhow many xy's am I left with? Well, I'm left with no xy's. Or you could say add\\nthe coefficients, 4 plus negative 4,\\ngives you 0 xy's. Either way, these\\ntwo cancel out. If I have 4 of something\\nand I take away those 4 of that something,\\nI'm left with none of them. And so I'm left with no xy's. And then I have\\nright over here-- I could have written\\n0xy, but that seems unnecessary--\\nthen right over here I have my x squared terms. Negative 2 plus 3 is 1. Or another way of saying\\nit, if I have 3x squared and I were to take\\naway 2 of those x squared, so I'm left\\nwith the 1x squared. So this right over here\\nsimplifies to 1x squared. Or I could literally\\njust write x squared. 1x squared is the same\\nthing as x squared. So plus x squared,\\nand then these there's nothing really left to simplify. So plus 2x plus y squared. And we're done. And obviously you\\nmight have gotten an answer in some other\\norder, but the order in which I write these\\nterms don't matter. It just matters that you\\nwere able to simplify it to these four terms. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] What I wanna do in this video is get some practice simplifying expressions and have some hairier numbers involved. These numbers are kind of hairy. Like always, try to pause this video and see if you can simplify this expression before I take a stab at it. All right, I'm assuming you have attempted it. Now let's look at it. We have -5.55 minus 8.55c plus 4.35c. So the first thing I wanna do is can I combine these c terms, and I definitely can. We can add -8.55c to 4.35c first, and then that would be, let's see, that would be -8.55 plus 4.35, I'm just adding the coefficients, times c, and of course, we still have that -5.55 out front. -5.55. I'll just put a plus there. Now how do we calculate -8.55 plus 4.35? Well there's a couple of ways to think about it or visualize it. One way is to say well this is the same thing as the negative of 8.55 minus 4.35, and 8.55 minus 4.35, let's see, eight minus four is going to be the negative, eight minus four is four, 55 hundredths minus 35 hundredths is 20 hundredths. So I could write 4.20, which is really just the same thing as 4.2. So all of this can be replaced with a -4.2. So my entire expression has simplified to -5.55, and instead of saying plus -4.2c, I can just write it as minus 4.2c, and we're done. We can't simplify this anymore. We can't add this term that doesn't involve the variable to this term that does involve the variable. So this is about as simple as we're gonna get. So let's do another example. So here I have some more hairy numbers involved. These are all expressed as fractions. And so, let's see, I have 2/5m minus 4/5 minus 3/5m. So how can I simplify? Well I could add all the m terms together. So let me just change the order. I could rewrite this as 2/5m minus 3/5m minus 4/5. All I did was I changed the order. We can see that I have these two m terms. I can add those two together. So this is going to be 2/5 minus 3/5 times m, and then I have the -4/5 still on the right hand side. Now what's 2/5 minus 3/5? Well that's gonna be -1/5. That's gonna be -1/5. So I have -1/5m minus 4/5. Minus 4/5. Now once again, I'm done. I can't simplify it anymore. I can't add this term that involves m somehow to this -4/5. So we are done here. Let's do one more. Let's do one more example. So here, and this is interesting, I have a parentheses and all the rest. Like always, pause the video. See if you can simplify this. All right, let's work through it together. Now the first thing that I want to do is let's distribute this two so that we just have three terms that are just being added and subtracted. So if we distribute this two, we're gonna get two times 1/5m is 2/5m. Let me make sure you see that m. M is right here. Two times -2/5 is -4/5, and then I have plus 3/5. Now how can we simplify this more? Well I have these two terms here that don't involve the variable. Those are just numbers. I can add them to each other. So I have -4/5 plus 3/5. So what's negative four plus three? That's going to be negative one. So this is going to be -1/5, what we have in yellow here. I still have the 2/5m, 2/5m minus 1/5. And we're done. We've simplified that as much as we can. \"),\n",

This is \"undefined.\" Sometimes when you see\\n\"undefined\" in math class it seems like a\\nvery strange thing. It seems like a\\nvery bizarre idea. But it really means exactly\\nwhat the word means. Mathematicians\\nhave never defined what it must mean\\nto divide by zero. What is that value? And the reason they\\nhaven\\'t done it is because they couldn\\'t\\ncome up with a good answer. There\\'s no good answer\\nhere, no good definition. And because of that,\\nany non-zero number, divided by zero, is\\nleft just \"undefined.\" 7 divided by 0. 8 divided by 0. Negative 1 divided by 0. We say all of these things\\nare just \"undefined.\" You might say, well if\\nwe can just define it, let\\'s at least try to come\\nup with a definition of what it means to take a non-zero\\nnumber divided by zero. So let\\'s do that right now. We could just take the simplest\\nof all non-zero numbers. We\\'ll just do it with one. But we could have done this\\nwith any non-zero number. Let\\'s take the example of one. Since we don\\'t know\\nwhat it means-- or we\\'re trying to figure out what it\\nmeans to divide by zero Lets just try out really, really,\\nsmall positive numbers. Let\\'s divide by really,\\nreally small positive numbers and see what happens as\\nwe get close to zero. So lets divide by 0.1 Well,\\nthis will get us to 10. If we divide 1 by 0.01\\nthat gets us to 100. If I go really,\\nreally close to zero. If I divide 1 by\\n0.000001 this gets us-- so this is not a tenth,\\nhundredth, thousandth, ten thousandth,\\nhundred thousandth. This is a millionth. 1 divided by a millionth, that\\'s\\ngoing to give us 1 million. So we see a pattern here. As we divide one by smaller\\nand smaller and smaller positive numbers, we get a\\nlarger and larger and larger value. Based on just this you\\nmight say, well, hey, I\\'ve got somewhat of a\\ndefinition for 1 divided by 0. Maybe we can say that 1 divided\\nby 0 is positive infinity. As we get smaller and smaller\\npositive numbers here, we get super super large\\nnumbers right over here. But then, your friend\\nmight say, well, that worked when we divided by\\npositive numbers close to zero but what happens when we\\ndivide by negative numbers close to zero? So lets try those out. Well, 1 divided by negative 0.1,\\nthat\\'s going to be negative 10. 1 divided by\\nnegative 0.01, that\\'s going to be negative 100. And, if we go all the way to 1\\ndivided by negative 0.000001-- yup, I drew the same\\nnumber of zeros-- that gets us to\\nnegative 1 million. So you when we keep dividing\\n1 by negative numbers that are closer and closer and\\ncloser and closer to zero, we get a very different answer. We actually start approaching\\nnegative infinity. So over here we said maybe it\\nwould be positive infinity, but you can make an\\nequally strong argument that it could be a\\nvery different number. Negative infinity is going\\nthe exact opposite direction. So you could make an\\nequally strong argument that it should be\\nnegative infinity. And this is why\\nmathematicians say there\\'s just no\\ngood answer here. Especially one that\\'s consistent\\nwith the rest of mathematics. They could have just said\\nit\\'s equal to 42 or something like that. But that would make no sense. It\\'s neither one\\nof these values, and it wouldn\\'t be consistent\\nwith everything else we know. So they just left the\\nwhole thing \"undefined.\" '),\n",

Let\\'s get even closer to zero: 0.001 divided by 0.001. Well, that also equals one. Let\\'s get super close to zero: 0.000001 divided by 0.000001. Well once again, that also equals one. And it didn\\'t even matter whether these were positive or negative. I could make these negative and I\\'d still get the same result. Negative this thing divided by negative this thing still gets me to one.

Make all of these negatives, you still get the same answer. So this line of reasoning tells you that it\\'s completely legitimate, to think at least that maybe zero divided by zero could be equal to zero. And these are equally valid arguments. And because they\\'re equally valid, and frankly neither of them is consistent with the rest of mathematics, once again mathematicians have left zero divided by zero as undefined. '),\n",

       "  \"Alright, now we have a very interesting situation. On both sides of the scale, we have our mystery mass and now I'm calling the mystery mass having a mass of Y. Just to show you that it doesn't always have to be X. It can be any symbol as long as you can keep track of that symbol. But all these have the same mass. That's why I wrote Y on all of them. And we also have a little 1 kilogram boxes on both sides of the scale. So the first thing I wanna do, we're gonna do step by step and try to figure out what this mystery mass is. But the first thing I wanna do is, is, is, have you think about, whether you can represent this algebraically? Whether with, with a little bit of mathematic symbolry, you can represent what's going on this scale. Over here, I have three Ys and three of these boxes and their total mass is equal to this one Y. And I think I have about let's see, I have 7 boxes right over here. So I'll give you a few seconds to do that. So let's think about the total mass over here. We have 3 boxes and a mass Y. So they're going to have a mass of 3Y, and then you have 3 boxes with a mass of 1 kilogram. So they're going to have a mass of 3 kilograms. Now over here, I have 1 box with a mass of Y kilograms. So that's going to be my 1Y right over there. I could've written 1Y but that's, I don't need to. A Y is the same thing as 1Y. So I have the Y kilograms right there. And I have seven of these, right? 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Yup, seven of these. So I have Y plus 7 kilograms on the right-hand side. And once again, it's balanced. The scale is balanced. This mass, total mass is equal to this total mass. So we can write an equal sign, right over there. So that's a good starting point. We were able to represent this situation to this real-life simple situation. You know, back in the day, when people actually had to figure out the mass of things if you were to go the jewelry store, whatever. They actually did had problems like this. We were able to represent it mathematically. Now the next thing to do is, what are some reasonable next steps? How can we start to simplify this a little bit? You know, once again, I'll give you a few seconds to think about that. Well, the neat thing about algebra is there's actually multiple paths that you could go down. You might say, well why won't we remove 3 of these what, of these yellow blocks from both sides? That would be completely legitimate. You might say, well, why won't we remove 1 of these Ys from both sides? That also would be legitimate. And we could do it in either order. So let's just pick one of them. Let's say that we've first want to remove, let's say that we first want to remove the, a Y from either sides. Just so that we feel a little bit more comfortable with all of our Ys sitting on the 1 side. And so the best way, if we don't want all of our Ys to sit on the 1 side, we can remove, we can remove a Y from each side. Remember, if you removed a Y from only 1 side, that would unbalance the scale. The scale was already balanced whatever you have to do to the one side after you do the other. So I'm gonna remove a Y, I'm gonna remove Y mass from both sides. Now what will that look like algebraically? Well. I remove the Y from both sides. So I subtracted Y from the left-hand side and I subtracted Y from the right-hand side. That's exactly what I did. The mass, it had a massive Y. I don't know what that is but I did take it away. I lifted that block, that little, that little block. And so, on the left-hand side, on the left-hand side, what am I left with? That you can pick it up mathematically, you can even look up here, and look up here what you're left with. If I had 3 of something, and I take away 1 of them, if I take away 1 of them, I'm left with 2 of that something. So I'm left with 2Y, right over here, you see it. I had 3, I got rid of 1, so I'm left with 2. And I still have those 3 yellow blocks. So I still have those 3 yellow blocks. On the right-hand side, I had a Y, I took away the Y, and so now I have no Ys left. We see it visually right over here. And I still have 7 of the yellow blocks. So I still have 7 of the yellow blocks. And since I took the exact same mass from both sides of the scale, the scale is still going to be balanced. It was balanced before, I took away the same thing from both sides. And so the scale is still, is still balanced. So this is going to be equal to that. Now, now just trying to look a bit similar to what we saw in that last video. But I will ask you, what can we do from this point? What can we do from this point to simplify it further or so, even better, think of it so we could isolate the, these Ys on the left-hand side. And I'll give you a few seconds to think about that. Well, if we want to isolate these Ys on the left-hand side, these 2 Ys, the best way is to get rid of this 3, to get rid of these 3 blocks. So why won't we do that? Let's take 3 blocks from this side but we can't just take it from that side if we want to keep it balanced. We have to do it to this side too. We gotta take away, we gotta take away 3 blocks. So we're subtracting 3 from that side, and subtracting 3 from the right side. So on the left-hand side, on the left-hand side, we're gonna be left with just these 2 blocks of mass Y. So our total mass is now going to be 2Y. These 3 minus 3 is 0, and you see that here. We're just left with 2Ys right over here, and on the right-hand side, we got rid of 3 of the blocks. So we only have 4 of them left. So you have 4 of them left. So you have 2 of these Y masses is equal to 4 kilograms. And because we did the same thing to both sides, the scale is still balanced. And now, well how do we solve this? And you might be able to solve this in your head. I have 2 times something is equal to 4. And you can kind of think about what that is, but if we want to stay true to what we've been doing before, let's think about it. I have 2 of something, is equal to something else. What if I multiply both sides by 2? Oh, sorry, what if I multiply both sides by 1/2 or another way is dividing both sides by 2. If I multiply this side by 1/2, if I essentially take away half of the mass, or I'll only leave half of the mass, Then, I'm only gonna have 1 block here, and if I take away half of the mass over here, I'm gonna have to take away 2 of these blocks right over there. And what I just did, you could say I multiplied both sides by 1/2 or just for a sake of a little change, You could say I divided both sides by 2. And on the left-hand side, I'm left with a mass of Y. And on the right-hand side, I'm left with a mass of 4 divided by 2 is 2. And once again I can still write this equal sign because the scale is balanced. I did the exact same thing to both sides. I left half to what was on the left-hand side, and half of it was on the right-hand side. It was balanced before, half of each side, so it's going to be balanced again. But there, we've done it. We've solved something that's actually not so easy to solve. Or it might not look so easy first. We figured out that our mystery mass Y is 2 kilograms. And you can verify this, this is the really fun thing about algebra. Is it, once you get to this point, you can go back and think about whether the original, the original problem you saw made sense. Let's do that. Let's think about whether the original problem made sense. And to do that, I want you to, I want you to calculate. Now that we know what the mass Y is it's 2 kilograms. What was the total mass on each side? Well, let's calculate it. We have 2 right, right over here, this is 2 kilograms, I'll do that in purple color,so this is a 2, this is a 2, this is a 2. So we had 6 kilograms plus these 3, we had 9 kilograms on the left-hand side. And on the right-hand side, I had these 7 plus 2 here, 7 plus 2 is 9 kilograms. That's why it was balanced. Our mystery mass, we had 9 kilograms, total on both sides. \"),\n",

       "  \"Let's try to solve a\\nmore involved equation. So, let's say that we have 2x\\nplus 3, 2x plus 3 is equal to is equal to 5x minus 2. So this might look a\\nlittle daunting at first. We have x's on both\\nsides of the equation. We're adding and\\nsubtracting numbers. How do you solve it? And we'll do it in a\\ncouple of different ways. The the important thing\\nto remember is, we just want to isolate an x. Once you've isolated an x,\\nyou have x equals something. Or x equals something. You're done, you've\\nsolved the equation. You can actually go back and\\ncheck whether that works, So what we're going to do is just\\ndo a bunch of operations on both sides of the equation,\\nto eventually isolate the x. But while we do those, I\\nactually want to visualize what's occurring. Because I don't want you just\\nsay, oh what are the rules or the steps of solving equations. And I forgot whether this is a\\nallowed or that isn't allowed. If you visualize what's\\nhappening, it'll actually be common sense what's allowed. So let's visualize it. So we have 2x right here\\non the left-hand side. So that's literally,\\nthat's x plus x. And then you have plus 3. Plus 3, I'll do it like this. So that's equal to plus\\n1, plus 1, plus 1. That's the same thing as 3. I could've drawn 3\\ncircles here as well. Let do the same color. Plus 3. And then that is\\nequal to 5 x's. Do that in blue. That is equal to 5 x's. So, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. And I want to make it clear. You would never actually\\nhave to do it this way when you're solving the problem. You would just have to\\ndo the algebraic steps. But I'm doing this for you so\\nyou can actually visualize what this equation is saying. the left-hand side is these\\ntwo orange x's plus 3. The right-hand side\\nis 5x minus 2. So minus 2, we could write\\nas -- so let me do this in a different color,\\nI'll do it in pink. So, minus 2, I'll do as\\nminus 1 and minus 1. Now, we want to isolate\\nthe x's on the same side of the equation. So, how could we do that? Well, there's two\\nways of doing it. We could subtract these\\ntwo x's from both sides of the equation. And that would be\\npretty reasonable. Because then you'd have\\n5 x's minus the 2 x's. You'd have a positive number of\\nx's on the right-hand side. Or, you could actually\\nsubtract 5x from both sides. And that's what's\\nneat about algebra. As long as you do legitimate\\noperations, you will eventually get the right answer. So let's just start off\\nsubtracting 2x from both sides of the equation. And what I mean there, I mean\\nwe're going to remove 2 x's from the left-hand side. And if we were to move 2 x's on\\nthe left-hand side, we have to remove 2 x's the\\nright-hand side. Just like that. So what does that give us? We're subtracting 2 x's. 2 x's from the left. And we're also going to\\nsubtract 2 x's from the right. Now, what does our left-hand\\nside simplify to? We have 2x plus 3 minus 2x. The 2 x's cancel out. So you're just left with --\\nyou're just left with the 3. And you see that over here. We took 2 of these x's away. We're just left with the\\nplus 1, plus 1, plus 1. And then on the right-hand\\nside, 5x minus 2x. We have it over here. We have 5 x's minus 2 x's. You only have 1, 2,\\n3, x's left over. 3 is equal to 3x. And then you have\\nyour minus 2 there. You have your minus 2. So, normally if you were to do\\nthe problem, you would just have to write what we have\\nhere on the left-hand side. So what can we do next? Remember, we want to\\nisolate the x's. Well, we have all of our x's on\\nthe right-hand side right here. If we could get rid of this\\nnegative 2, off of the right-hand side, then\\nthe x's will be alone. They'll be isolated. So how can we get rid of\\nthis negative 2, if we visualize it over here. This negative 1,\\nthis negative 1. Well, we could add 2 to both\\nsides of this equation. Think about what happens there. So, if we add 2, so I'm\\ngoing to do it like this. Plus 1, plus 1. So you could literally see. We're adding 2. And then we're going to add\\n2 to the left-hand side. 1 plus, 1 plus. What happens? Let me do it over here as well. So we're going to add 2. We're going to add 2. So what happens to\\nthe left-hand side? 3 plus 2 is going\\nto be equal to 5. And that is going to be\\nequal to 3x minus 2 plus 2. These guys cancel out. And you're just left with 3x. And we see it over here. We have the left-hand side is 1\\nplus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. We have 5 1's, or 5. And the right-hand side,\\nwe have the 3 x's, right over there. And then we have the\\nnegative 1, negative 1. Plus 1, plus 1, negative\\n1, these cancel out. They get us to 0. They cancel out. So we're just left with\\n5 is equal to 3x. So we have 1, 2, 3,\\n4, 5 is equal to 3x. Let me clear everything that\\nwe've removed, so it looks a little bit cleaner. These are all of the things\\nthat we've removed. Let me clear that out. And then let me clear\\nthat out, like that. Edit. Clear. So now we are just left\\nwith 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Actually, let me\\nmove this over. So I could just move this\\nover right over here. We now have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. These are the two that we\\nadded here, is equal to 3x. These guys canceled out. That's why we have\\nnothing there. Now, to solve this, we\\njust divide both sides of this equation by 3. And this is going to\\nbe a little hard to visualize over here. But if we divide over here both\\nsides by 3, what do we get? We divide the left by 3. We divide the right by 3. The whole reason why we divided\\nby 3 is because the x was being multiplied by 3. 3 is the coefficient on the x. Fancy word, it literally\\njust means the number multiplying the variable. The number we're solving, the\\nvariable we're solving for. So these 3's cancel out. The right-hand side of\\nthe equation is just x. The left-hand side is 5/3. So 5/3, we could say\\nis is equal to 5/3. And this is different than\\neverything we've seen so far. I now have the x on the\\nright-hand side, the value on the left-hand side. That's completely fine. This is the exact same thing as\\nsaying 5/3 is is equal to x is the same thing as saying\\nx's equal to 5/3. Completely equivalent. Completely equivalent. We sometimes get more used\\nto this one, but this is completely the same thing. Now, if we wanted to write this\\nas a mixed number, if we want to write this as a mixed\\nnumber, 3 goes into 5 one time with remainder 2. So it's going to be 1 2/3. So it's going to be 1 2/3. So we could also write\\nthat x is equal to 1 2/3. And I'll leave it up for you\\nto actually substitute back into this original equation. And see that it works out. Now, to visualize it over here,\\nyou know, how did he get 1 2/3, let's think about it. Instead of doing 1, I'm\\ngoing to do circles. I am going to do circles. Actually, even better,\\nI'm going to do squares. So I'm going to have 5 squares\\non the left-hand side. I'll do it in this same\\nyellow color right here. So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And that is going to be\\nequal to the 3 x's. x plus x plus x. Now, we're dividing both\\nsides of the equation by 3. We're dividing both sides\\nof the equation by 3. Actually, that's where\\nwe did it up here, we divided both sides by 3. So how do you do that\\nright-hand side's pretty straightforward. You want to divide these\\n3 x's into 3 groups. That's 1, 2, 3 groups. 1, 2, 3. Now, how do you\\ndivide 5 into 3? And they have to be thought\\nthrough even groups. And the answer tells us. Each group is going\\nto be 1 2/3. So, 1 2/3. So it's going to be 2/3\\nof this, the next one. And then we're going\\nto have 1 2/3. So this is 1/3. We're going to need another. Another 1, so this is 1 1/3. We're going to need 1 more\\n1/3, so this is going to be right here. And then we're left\\nwith 2/3 and 1. So we've broken it\\nup into 3 groups. This right here. Let me make it clear. Let me make it clear, this\\nright here is 1 2/3. 1 2/3. And then this right\\nhere, this 1/3. That's another 1/3, so\\nthat's 2/3, and then that's 1 right there. So that's 1 2/3. And then finally this\\nis 2/3 and this is 1, so this is 1 2/3. So when you divide both\\nsides by 3 you get 1 2/3. Each section, each bucket, is\\n1 2/3 on the left-hand side. On the left-hand side, or 5/3. And on the right-hand\\nside we just have an x. So it still works. A little bit harder to\\nvisualize with fractions. \"),\n",

And then we'll put all the x\\nterms, the negative 7x and the 6x, we'll put it all on\\nthe left-hand side. So to get the 20 out of the way\\nfrom the left-hand side, let's subtract it. Let's subtract it from\\nthe left-hand side. But this is an equation,\\nanything you do to the left-hand side, you also have to\\ndo to the right-hand side.

Negative 7 of something minus\\nanother 6 of that something is going to be negative 13\\nof that something. And that is going to be\\nequal to 6x minus 6x. That cancels out. That was the whole point by\\nsubtracting negative 6x. And then we have just a negative\\n26, or minus 26, depending on how you want to\\nview it, so negative 13x is equal to negative 26. Now, our whole goal, just to\\nremember, is to isolate the x. We have a negative 13\\ntimes the x here. So the best way to isolate it is\\nif we have something times x, if we divide by\\nthat something, we'll isolate the x. So let's divide by\\nnegative 13. Now, you know by now, anything\\nyou do to the left-hand side of an equation, you have to\\ndo to the right-hand side. So we're going to have to\\ndivide both sides of the equation by negative 13. Now, what does the left-hand\\nside become? Negative 13 times x divided\\nby negative 13, that's just going to be x. You multiply something times x,\\ndivide it by the something, you're just going to\\nbe left with an x. So the left-hand side\\njust becomes an x. x is equal to negative 26\\ndivided by negative 13.

So what I'm going to do, right\\nfrom the start of this video, is to multiply both sides of\\nthis equation by some number so I can get rid of\\nthe fractions. And the best number to do it\\nby-- what number is the smallest number that if I\\nmultiply both of these fractions by it, they won't be\\nfractions anymore, they'll be whole numbers?

That's the same thing as 8 times\\n3 over 4, which is equal to 8 divided by 4 is just 2. So it's 2 times 3, which is 6. So the left-hand side becomes\\n8 times 3/4x is 6x. And then 8 times 2 is 16. You have to remember, when you\\nmultiply both sides, or a side, of an equation by a\\nnumber, you multiply every term by that number. So you have to distribute\\nthe 8. So the left-hand side is 6x plus\\n16 is going to be equal to-- 8 times 3/8, that's pretty\\neasy, the 8's cancel out and you're just\\nleft with 3x. And then 8 times negative\\n4 is negative 32.

The left-hand side of this\\nequation, 6x minus 3x is 3x. 6 minus 3 is 3. And then you have a plus 16 is\\nequal to-- 3x minus 3x, that's the whole point of subtracting\\n3x, is so they cancel out. So those guys cancel out, and\\nwe're just left with a negative 32. Now, let's get rid of the 16\\nfrom the left-hand side. So to get rid of it, we're going\\nto subtract 16 from both sides of this equation. Subtract 16 from both sides. The left-hand side of the\\nequation just becomes-- you have this 3x here; these 16's\\ncancel out, you don't have to write anything-- is equal to\\nnegative 32 minus 16 is negative 48. So we have 3x is equal\\nto negative 48. To isolate the x, we can just\\ndivide both sides of this equation by 3. So let's divide both sides\\nof that equation by 3. The left-hand side of the\\nequation, 3x divided by 3 is just an x. That was the whole point\\nbehind dividing both sides by 3. And the right-hand side,\\nnegative 48 divided by 3 is negative 16. And we are done. x equals negative 16\\nis our solution. So let's make sure that this\\nactually works by substituting to the original equation\\nup here. And the original equation\\ndidn't have those 8's out front. So let's substitute in the\\noriginal equation. We get 3/4-- 3 over 4-- times\\nnegative 16 plus 2 needs to be equal to 3/8 times negative\\n16 minus 4. So 3/4 of 16 is 12. And you can think\\nof it this way. What's 16 divided by 4? It is 4. And then multiply that\\nby 3, it's 12, just multiplying fractions. So this is going to\\nbe a negative 12. So we get negative 12 plus\\n2 on the left-hand side, negative 12 plus 2\\nis negative 10.

So it's a negative 6 minus 4. Negative 6 minus 4\\nis negative 10. So when x is equal to negative\\n16, it does satisfy the original equation. Both sides of the equation\\nbecome negative 10.

Well, whenever we see\\nan x in the denominator, the temptation is\\nto multiply it by x. But we can't just multiply\\none of the terms by x. We have to multiply\\nthe entire side by x. So we could multiply\\nthis entire side by x. But we can't just multiply\\nthe left-hand side by x. We'd also want to multiply\\nthe right-hand side by x. And so what will that give us? Well, we distribute the x. We get x times 7 is 7x. And then x times\\nnegative 10/x, well, that's just going\\nto be negative 10. So you get negative\\n10 right over there. So the left-hand side\\nsimplifies to 7x minus 10. And then your right-hand\\nside, once again, distribute the x.\\nx times 2 is 2x. x times 15/x, well,\\nx times something over x is just going to be\\nthe something. x times 15/x is just going to\\nbe 15-- plus 15. So now we've simplified\\nthis to a linear equation. We have the variable\\non both sides. So we just have to do\\nsome of the techniques that we already know. So the first thing\\nthat I like to do is maybe get all my x's\\non the left-hand side. So I want to get rid of\\nthis 2x right over here. So I subtract 2x from\\nthe right-hand side. Now, and I always remind\\nyou, I can't do that just to the right-hand side. If I did it just to\\nthe right-hand side, it wouldn't be an\\nequality anymore. You have to do that to the\\nleft-hand side as well. And so we are left with-- let\\nme get that pink color again. On the left-hand side, 7x, 7 of\\nsomething minus 2 of something, well, you're going to have 5\\nof that something, minus 10. These two x's negate each other. And you're left with equals 15. Now we can get rid\\nof this negative 10 by adding 10 to both sides. You know, I like\\nthat green color when I do stuff to both sides. So I can add 10 to both sides. And I'm left with\\n5x-- these negate each other-- is equal to 25. And this is the home stretch. You see where this is going. We can divide both sides by 5. And we are left with\\nx is equal to 5. Now let's verify that\\nthis actually worked. So let's go back to\\nthe original equation. We have 7 minus 10/5. This needs to be\\nequal to-- I'm just taking our 5 and\\nsubstituting it back here. This needs to be\\nequal to 2 plus 15/5. So this is 7 minus 10/5. This is just 2. It needs to be equal to 2\\nplus 15/5, which is just 3. So 2 plus 3, 7 minus\\n2 is 5, 2 plus 3 is 5, 5 is indeed equal to 5. And we are done. \"),\n",

       "  \"We have the equation negative 9\\nminus this whole expression, 9x minus 6-- this whole thing\\nis being subtracted from negative 9-- is equal to\\n3 times this whole expression, 4x plus 6. Now, a good place to start is\\nto just get rid of these parentheses. And the best way to get rid of\\nthese parentheses is to kind of multiply them out. This has a negative 1-- you\\njust see a minus here, but it's just really the same thing\\nas having a negative 1-- times this quantity. And here you have a 3\\ntimes this quantity. So let's multiply it out using\\nthe distributive property. So the left-hand side of\\nour equation, we have our negative 9. And then we want to multiply the\\nnegative 1 times each of these terms. So negative 1 times\\n9x is negative 9x, and then negative 1 times negative\\n6 is plus 6, or positive 6. And then that is going to be\\nequal to-- let's distribute the 3-- 3 times 4x is 12x. And then 3 times 6 is 18. Now what we want to do, let's\\ncombine our constant terms, if we can. We have a negative 9 and a 6\\nhere, on this side, we've combined all of our like terms.\\nWe can't combine a 12x and an 18, so let's\\ncombine this. So let's combine the negative 9\\nand the 6, our two constant terms on the left-hand\\nside of the equation. So we're going to have\\nthis negative 9x. So we're going to have negative\\n9x plus-- let's see, we have a negative 9 and then\\nplus 6-- so negative 9 plus 6 is negative 3. So we're going to have a\\nnegative 9x, and then we have a negative 3, so minus\\n3 right here. That's the negative 9 plus\\nthe 6, and that is equal to 12x plus 18. Now, we want to group all the\\nx terms on one side of the equation, and all of the\\nconstant terms-- the negative 3 and the positive 18 on the\\nother side-- I like to always have my x terms on the left-hand\\nside, if I can. You don't have to have them on\\nthe left, so let's do that. So if I want all my x terms on\\nthe left, I have to get rid of this 12x from the right. And the best way to do that is\\nto subtract 12x from both sides of the equation. So let me subtract 12x from the\\nright, and subtract 12x from the left. Now, on the left-hand side, I\\nhave negative 9x minus 12x. So negative 9 minus 12,\\nthat's negative 21. Negative 21x minus 3 is equal\\nto-- 12x minus 12x, well, that's just nothing. That's 0. So I could write a 0\\nhere, but I don't have to write anything. That was the whole point of\\nsubtracting the 12x from the left-hand side. And that is going to be equal\\nto-- so on the right-hand side, we just are\\nleft with an 18. We are just left with\\nthat 18 here. These guys canceled out. Now, let's get rid of\\nthis negative 3 from the left-hand side. So on the left-hand side, we\\nonly have x terms, and on the right-hand side, we only have\\nconstant terms. So the best way to cancel out a negative\\n3 is to add 3. So it cancels out to 0. So we're going to add\\n3 to the left, let's add 3 to the right. And we get-- the left-hand side\\nof the equation, we have the negative 21x, no other x\\nterm to add or subtract here, so we have negative 21x. The negative 3 and the plus 3,\\nor the positive 3, cancel out-- that was the whole\\npoint-- equals-- what's 18 plus 3? 18 plus 3 is 21. So now we have negative\\n21x is equal to 21. And we want to solve for x. So if you have something times\\nx, and you just want it to be an x, let's divide by\\nthat something. And in this case, that something\\nis negative 21. So let's divide both sides of\\nthis equation by negative 21. Divide both sides\\nby negative 21. The left-hand side, negative\\n21 divided by negative 21, you're just left with an x. That was the whole point behind dividing by negative 21. And we get x is equal\\nto-- what's 21 divided by negative 21? Well, that's just negative 1. Right? You have the positive version\\ndivided by the negative version of itself, so it's\\njust negative 1. So that is our answer. Now let's verify that this\\nactually works for that original equation. So let's substitute negative 1\\ninto that original equation. So we have negative 9-- I'll do\\nit over here; I'll do it in a different color than we've\\nbeen using-- we have negative 9 minus-- that 1 wasn't there\\noriginally, it's there implicitly-- minus 9\\ntimes negative 1. 9 times-- I'll put negative 1\\nin parentheses-- minus 6 is equal to-- well, actually,\\nlet me just solve for the left-hand side when I substitute\\na negative 1 there. So the left-hand side becomes\\nnegative 9, minus 9 times negative 1 is negative\\n9, minus 6. And so this is negative 9\\nminus-- in parentheses-- negative 9 minus 6\\nis negative 15. So this is equal\\nto negative 15. And so we get negative 9-- let\\nme make sure I did that-- negative 9 minus 6,\\nyep, negative 15. So negative 9 minus negative 15,\\nthat's the same thing as negative 9 plus 15,\\nwhich is 6. So that's what we get on the\\nleft-hand side of the equation when we substitute x is\\nequal to negative 1. We get that it equals 6. So let's see what happens when\\nwe substitute negative 1 to the right-hand side\\nof the equation. I'll do it in green. We get 3 times 4 times\\nnegative 1 plus 6. So that is 3 times negative\\n4 plus 6. Negative 4 plus 6 is 2. So it's 3 times 2,\\nwhich is also 6. So when x is equal to negative\\n1, you substitute here, the left-hand side becomes 6, and\\nthe right-hand side becomes 6. So this definitely works out. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] In many other videos, we've taken equations like this and tried to quote solve for X. What we're gonna do in\\nthis video is deepen our understanding a little\\nbit about what's going on and really think about\\nthe notion of equivalence or equivalence statements. So let me write that down, equivalence. Now, what do I mean by equivalence? Well, I'll use this equation here to essentially keep rewriting\\nit in equivalent ways and I'll talk a little bit\\nmore about what that means. So one thing that I\\ncould do to essentially write the same equivalence statement is I could distribute\\nthis three onto the X or onto the X plus one\\nand then this part of it could be rewritten as three X plus three and then we have minus X is equal to nine. Now, what I will say or what\\nit might be obvious to you on some level is this top equation and this second equation are equivalent. What does that mean? It means if one of them\\nis true for given X, the other one will be true\\nfor that same X as well, and vice versa and we can write other equivalence statements. For example, if we were\\nto combine X terms, if we were to take three\\nX and then minus X, right over there, I could\\nrewrite that as two X and then I have plus\\nthree is equal to nine. Now all three of these\\nstatements are equivalent. If there's an X where two times that X plus three is equal to nine, then it is also the case that\\nthree times that X plus one minus X is equal to nine and vice versa. If there's some X that would\\nmake this top equation true then it's going to make\\nthis last equation true. And we can do other equivalence\\npreserving operations and you've seen them before. You could subtract three from both sides. In general, if you are adding\\nor subtracting the same value from both sides, it is\\nequivalence preserving. If you're distributing a value like we did in that first step that\\nis equivalence preserving. If you combine like terms so to speak, that is equivalence preserving and so here we'll do an\\nequivalence preserving operation. We'll subtract three from both sides and you would get two X is equal to six and once again, any X that\\nsatisfies this last equation will satisfy any of the other\\nequations and vice versa. Any X that's satisfies any\\nof these other equations will satisfy this last one and so they are all\\nequivalent to each other. And then another equivalence\\npreserving operation is to multiply or divide both\\nsides by a non zero constant. And so here we could\\ndivide both sides by two, two is not zero and it's constant and if we did that, we will get\\nanother equivalent statement that X is equal to three. So any X that satisfies this\\nand there's one, X equals three would satisfy the other ones\\nand any X that satisfies any of the other ones\\nwould satisfy this last one so these are all equivalent. So one way to think about it, adding the same number to\\nboth sides of an equation that is equivalence preserving. Multiply or dividing both sides\\nby a non-zero constant value is equivalence preserving. Distributing like we\\ndid in this first step equivalence preserving,\\ncombining like terms equivalence preserving. Now you're probably saying, well, what are some non\\nequivalence preserving operations? Well, imagine something like this, lemme just start with\\nsomething very obvious. If I said that X is equal to two a non equivalence preserving operation is if I were to add or\\nsubtract or multiply or divide only one side of this equation by a value let's say I only added\\none to the left side. Then I would have X\\nplus one is equal to two and it is not the case that\\nanything that satisfies this second equation\\nsatisfies the top equation or vice versa. X equals two clearly\\nsatisfies the top equation but it doesn't satisfy the second one, that's because we did a non equivalence preserving operation. Likewise, if I only multiplied\\nthe right hand side by three, I would get X is equal to six. Well, by only multiplying\\nthe right hand side by value it's not the case that anything\\nthat satisfies X equals six will satisfy X equals two,\\nthat is somewhat obvious here. Now there's a little\\nbit trickier scenarios, let's say we have the equation\\nfive X is equal to six X. Now, one temptation is, well,\\nI wanna do the same thing to both sides, I could just\\ndivide both sides by X, what'll happen in that scenario? Well, if you divide both sides by X you could think that an\\nequivalence statement is that five is equal to six\\nand you know that there's no X for which five is equal to six. You can't make five equal\\nsix or six equal five and so this would somehow\\nmake you imply that okay, there's no X that can satisfy. If you assume that these\\nwere equivalence statements, you'd say there's nothing that\\ncould satisfy five equal six so maybe there's nothing that\\nsatisfies this top equation. But this actually isn't an\\nequivalence preserving operation because you're actually\\ndealing with a scenario where X is equal to zero\\nand you're dividing by zero. And so you have to be very careful when you're dividing by a variable, especially if the variable\\nthat makes that equation true happens to be zero. And so in order to be clear that you're preserving equivalence here, the way that I would tackle it is I would subtract five X from both sides and if you do that, and\\nthat is an equivalence preserving operation, you\\ncould subtract that expression from both sides or that\\nterm from both sides and then you would be left\\nwith zero is equal to X and now zero equals X\\nand five X equals six X, these are equivalence statements. They are equivalent equations anything that makes this\\none true is going to make that one true and anyone\\nthat makes that one true is going to make this one true. Now one last thing you\\nmight have heard me say, you can multiply or\\ndivide by non-zero value and that's going to be\\nequivalence preserving. And hopefully you've just got a sense of why dividing by zero\\nis not a good idea. In fact, dividing by zero\\nis always going to be a strange thing and it's undefined, but also multiplying by zero. For example, if I had, let's say, actually lemme start over here. If I had two X is equal to\\nsix, and if I were to multiply both sides by zero, I would\\nget zero is equal to zero and zero equals zero is true for any X. Zero is always going to be equal to zero but the problem is, is that\\nfirst statement isn't true for all X it's only\\ntrue for X equals three. So these two are not\\nequivalent statements. They have a different set\\nof Xs that will satisfy them and so you have to be very\\ncareful when you're dealing with things that are either are zero you can add or subtract zeros, obviously that's not\\ngonna change things much, but when you multiply both sides by zero, you can start getting things that are not equivalence statements and when you multiply or divide by things that could be zero, like variables, that also is a dangerous game to play. \"),\n",

       "  \"Determine the\\nnumber of solutions for each of these\\nequations, and they give us three equations right over here. And before I deal with these\\nequations in particular, let's just remind\\nourselves about when we might have one or\\ninfinite or no solutions. You're going to\\nhave one solution if you can, by\\nsolving the equation, come up with something like\\nx is equal to some number. Let's say x is\\nequal to-- if I want to say the abstract--\\nx is equal to a. Or if we actually\\nwere to solve it, we'd get something like x\\nequals 5 or 10 or negative pi-- whatever it might be. But if you could actually\\nsolve for a specific x, then you have one solution. So this is one solution,\\njust like that. Now if you go and you try to\\nmanipulate these equations in completely legitimate\\nways, but you end up with something crazy\\nlike 3 equals 5, then you have no solutions. And if you just think\\nabout it reasonably, all of these equations\\nare about finding an x that satisfies this. And if you were to just\\nkeep simplifying it, and you were to get\\nsomething like 3 equals 5, and you were to ask\\nyourself the question is there any x that can somehow\\nmagically make 3 equal 5, no. No x can magically\\nmake 3 equal 5, so there's no way that you could\\nmake this thing be actually true, no matter\\nwhich x you pick. So if you get something\\nvery strange like this, this means there's no solution. On the other hand, if you get\\nsomething like 5 equals 5-- and I'm just over\\nusing the number 5. It didn't have to\\nbe the number 5. It could be 7 or 10\\nor 113, whatever. And actually let\\nme just not use 5, just to make sure that you\\ndon't think it's only for 5. If I just get something,\\nthat something is equal to itself,\\nwhich is just going to be true no matter what\\nx you pick, any x you pick, this would be true for. Well, then you have\\nan infinite solutions. So with that as a\\nlittle bit of a primer, let's try to tackle\\nthese three equations. So over here, let's see. Maybe we could subtract. If we want to get rid of this\\n2 here on the left hand side, we could subtract\\n2 from both sides. If we subtract 2\\nfrom both sides, we are going to be left\\nwith-- on the left hand side we're going to be\\nleft with negative 7x. And on the right\\nhand side, you're going to be left with 2x. This is going to\\ncancel minus 9x. 2x minus 9x, If we simplify\\nthat, that's negative 7x. You get negative 7x is\\nequal to negative 7x. And you probably see\\nwhere this is going. This is already true\\nfor any x that you pick. Negative 7 times that x is going\\nto be equal to negative 7 times that x. So we already are going\\ninto this scenario. But you're like hey, so\\nI don't see 13 equals 13. Well, what if you did\\nsomething like you divide both sides by negative 7. At this point, what I'm\\ndoing is kind of unnecessary. You already understand that\\nnegative 7 times some number is always going to be\\nnegative 7 times that number. But if we were to do this,\\nwe would get x is equal to x, and then we could subtract\\nx from both sides. And then you would\\nget zero equals zero, which is true for\\nany x that you pick. Zero is always going\\nto be equal to zero. So any of these\\nstatements are going to be true for any x you pick. So for this equation\\nright over here, we have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. Let's think about this one\\nright over here in the middle. So once again, let's try it. I'll do it a little\\nbit different. I'll add this 2x and this\\nnegative 9x right over there. So we will get negative 7x\\nplus 3 is equal to negative 7x. So 2x plus 9x is\\nnegative 7x plus 2. Well, let's add-- why don't we\\ndo that in that green color. Let's do that in\\nthat green color. Plus 2, this is 2. Now let's add 7x to both sides. Well if you add 7x to\\nthe left hand side, you're just going to\\nbe left with a 3 there. And if you add 7x to\\nthe right hand side, this is going to go\\naway and you're just going to be left with a 2 there. So all I did is I added 7x. I added 7x to both\\nsides of that equation. And now we've got\\nsomething nonsensical. I don't care what x you pick,\\nhow magical that x might be. There's no way that that x is\\ngoing to make 3 equal to 2. So in this scenario right over\\nhere, we have no solutions. There's no x in the universe\\nthat can satisfy this equation. Now let's try this\\nthird scenario. So once again, maybe we'll\\nsubtract 3 from both sides, just to get rid of\\nthis constant term. So we're going to get negative\\n7x on the left hand side. On the right hand side, we're\\ngoing to have 2x minus 1. And now we can subtract\\n2x from both sides. To subtract 2x from\\nboth sides, you're going to get-- so\\nsubtracting 2x, you're going to get negative\\n9x is equal to negative 1. Now you can divide both\\nsides by negative 9. And you are left with\\nx is equal to 1/9. So we're in this\\nscenario right over here. We very explicitly\\nwere able to find an x, x equals 1/9, that\\nsatisfies this equation. So this right over here\\nhas exactly one solution. \"),\n",

So like every equation\\nwe've done so far, we just want to isolate\\nall of the x's on one side of this equation. But before we do\\nthat, we can actually simplify each of these sides. On the left-hand\\nside, we can multiply the quantity 3x plus 10 times 8. So we're essentially\\njust distributing the 8, the distributive\\nproperty right here.

       "  \"- [Voiceover] So we have an equation. It says, a-x plus three-x\\nis equal to b-x plus five. And what I want to do\\ntogether is to solve for x, and if we solve for x it's going to be in terms of a, b, and other numbers. So pause the video and\\nsee if you can do that. All right now, let's do this together, and what I'm going to do, is I'm gonna try to\\ngroup all of the x-terms, let's group all the x-terms\\non the left-hand side. So, I already have a-x and\\nthree-x on the left-hand side. Let's get b-x onto the left-hand\\nside as well, and I can do that by subtracting b-x from both sides. And if I subtract b-x from both sides, I'm going to get on the right-hand side, I'm going to have a, or\\non the left-hand side, a-x plus three-x minus b-x, so I can do\\nthat in that color for fun, minus b-x, and that's\\ngoing to be equal to... Well, b-x minus b-x is just zero, and I have five. It is equal to five. And now what I can do is, I can factor an x out\\nof this left-hand side of this equation, out of all of the terms. So, I can rewrite this as x times... Well, a-x divided by x is a. Three-x divided by x is three, and then negative b-x divided by x is just going to be negative b. I could keep writing\\nit in that pink color. And that's all going to be equal to five. And now, to solve for x I can just divide both sides by, the thing that\\nx is being multiplied by, by a plus three minus b. So, I can divide both sides by a plus three minus b. A plus three minus b. On this side, they cancel out. And, I have x is equal to five over a plus three minus b, and we are done. Let's do one more of these. So, another equation here. We have a... Here we have a times the\\nquantity, five minus x, is equal to b-x minus eight. So, once again, pause the video and see if you can solve for x. Well, the way I like to approach these is let's just expand everything all out. So, let me just distribute this a, and then I'm gonna collect\\nall the x-terms on one side, and all of the non-x-terms\\non the other side, and essentially do what I\\njust did in the last example. So, let's first distribute this a. So the left-hand side becomes five-a, I could say a\\ntimes five or five-a, minus a-x, a-x, that is going to be equal to b-x minus eight. Now we can subtract b-x from both sides. So, we're gonna subtract\\nb-x from the left-hand side, b-x from the right-hand side. And, once again, the whole\\nreason I'm doing that, I want all the x-terms on the left, and all the non-x-terms on the right. And, actually, since I want all\\nthe non-x-terms on the right, I can actually subtract five-a\\nfrom both sides, as well. So I'm kind of doing\\ntwo steps at once, here, but hopefully it makes sense. I'm trying to get rid of the b-x here, and I'm trying to get\\nrid of the five-a here. So, I subtract five-a there, and I'll subtract five-a there, and then let's see what this give us. So, the five-a's cancel out. And, on the left-hand side, I have negative a-x, negative a-x, minus b-x, minus, you know, in that same green color, minus b-x. And on the right-hand side, I have... This is going to be equal to, the b-x's cancel out, and I have negative eight minus five-a. Negative eight minus, in that same magenta color, minus five-a. And let's see, I have all my x's on one side, all my\\nnon-x's on the other side. And here I can factor out an x, and if I factor out an x, what do I have? And, actually, one thing\\nthat might be nice. Let me just multiply both\\nsides by negative one. If I multiple both sides by negative one, I get a-x plus b-x, plus b-x is equal to eight plus five-a. That just gets rid of all\\nof those negative signs. And now I can factor out an x here. So let me factor out an x, and I get x times a plus b. A plus b is going to be equal to eight plus five-a. Eight plus five-a. And we're in the home stretch now. We can just divide both sides by a plus b. So we could divide both sides by a plus b. A plus b. And we're going to be left with, x is equal to eight plus five-a, plus five-a, over... Actually, I'll write a and\\nb in our original colors. A plus, so this was that a, that a, plus b. So this is the b, that's a and b, a plus b, and we're done. We have now solved for x in terms of a's and b's and other things. And we are all done. \"),\n",

So we also have to\\nsubtract p from the left. And so the left-hand side,\\nnegative 3p minus p-- that's negative 4p. And then we still have\\na minus 7 up here-- is going to be less than p minus p. Those cancel out. It is less than 9. Now the next thing\\nI'm in the mood to do is get rid of this\\nnegative 7, or this minus 7 here, so that we\\ncan better isolate the p on the left-hand side. So the best way I can think\\nof to get rid of a negative 7 is to add 7 to it. Then it will just\\ncancel out to 0. So let's add 7 to both\\nsides of this inequality. Negative 7 plus 7 cancel out. All we're left with\\nis negative 4p. On the right-hand side, we\\nhave 9 plus 7 equals 16. And it's still less than. Now, the last step\\nto isolate the p is to get rid of this\\nnegative 4 coefficient. And the easiest way I\\ncan think of to get rid of this negative\\n4 coefficient is to divide both\\nsides by negative 4. So if we divide this\\nside by negative 4, these guys are\\ngoing to cancel out. We're just going\\nto be left with p. We also have to do it\\nto the right-hand side. Now, there's one thing that\\nyou really have to remember, since this is an\\ninequality, not an equation. If you're dealing\\nwith an inequality and you multiply or divide\\nboth sides of an equation by a negative number, you\\nhave to swap the inequality. So in this case, the less\\nthan becomes greater than, since we're dividing\\nby a negative number. And so negative 4 divided by\\nnegative 4-- those cancel out. We have p is greater than\\n16 divided by negative 4, which is negative 4. And we can plot this\\nsolution set right over here. And then we can\\ntry out some values to help us feel good about\\nthe idea of it working. So let's say this is negative\\n5, negative 4, negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, 0. Let me write that a\\nlittle bit neater. And then we can keep\\ngoing to the right. And so our solution is p is\\nnot greater than or equal, so we have to\\nexclude negative 4. p is greater than negative 4,\\nso all the values above that. So negative 3.9999999 will work. Negative 4 will not work. And let's just try\\nsome values out to feel good that this is\\nreally the solution set. So first let's try out when\\np is equal to negative 3. This should work. The way I've drawn it,\\nthis is in our solution set. p equals negative 3\\nis greater than negative 4. So let's try that out. We have negative 3\\ntimes negative 3. The first negative\\n3 is this one, and then we're saying\\np is negative 3. Minus 7 should be less\\nthan-- instead of a p, we're going to\\nputting a negative 3. Should be less than\\nnegative 3 plus 9. Negative 3 times\\nnegative 3 is 9, minus 7 should be less than\\nnegative 3 plus 9 is 6. 9 minus 7 is 2. 2 should be less than 6,\\nwhich, of course, it is. Now let's try a value that\\ndefinitely should not work. So let's try negative 5. Negative 5 is not\\nin our solution set, so it should not work. So we have negative 3\\ntimes negative 5 minus 7. Let's see whether it is\\nless than negative 5 plus 9. Negative 3 times negative\\n5 is 15, minus 7. It really should not be\\nless than negative 5 plus 9. So we're just seeing if p\\nequals negative 5 works. 15 minus 7 is 8. And so we get 8 is\\nless than 4, which is definitely not the case. So p equals negative\\n5 doesn't work. And it shouldn't work, because\\nthat's not in our solution set. And now if we really want\\nto feel good about it, we can actually try\\nthis boundary point. Negative 4 should\\nnot work, but it should satisfy the\\nrelated equation. When I talk about\\nthe related equation, negative 4 should satisfy\\nnegative 3 minus 7 is equal to p plus 9. It'll satisfy this, but\\nit won't satisfy this. Because when we get the\\nsame value on both sides, the same value is not\\nless than the same value. So let's try it out. Let's see whether\\nnegative 4 at least satisfies the related equation. So if we get negative 3\\ntimes negative 4 minus 7, this should be equal\\nto negative 4 plus 9. So this is 12 minus 7 should\\nbe equal to negative 4 plus 9. It should be equal to 5. And this, of course, is true. 5 is equal to 5. So it satisfies the\\nrelated equation, but it should not satisfy this. If you put negative\\n4 for p here-- and I encourage you to do so. Actually, we could\\ndo it over here. Instead of an equals\\nsign, if you put it into the original inequality--\\nlet me delete all of that-- it really just becomes this. The original inequality\\nis this right over here. If you put negative\\n4, you have less than. And then you get 5 is less\\nthan 5, which is not the case. And that's good,\\nbecause we did not include that in\\nthe solution set. We put an open circle. If negative 4 was included,\\nwe would fill that in. But the only reason why\\nwe'd include negative 4 is if this was\\ngreater than or equal. So it's good that this does\\nnot work, because negative 4 is not part of our solution set. You can kind of view\\nit as a boundary point. \"),\n",

       "  'Solve for x. And we have 5x plus 7 is greater than 3 times x plus 1. So let\\'s just try to isolate \"x\" on one side of this inequality. But before we do that, let\\'s just simplify this righthand side. so we get 5x plus 7 is greater than - let\\'s distribute this 3. So 3 times x plus 1 is the same thing as 3 times x plus 3 times 1 so it\\'s going to be 3x plus 3 times 1 is 3. Now if we want to put our x\\'s on the lefthand side, we can subtract 3x from both sides. That will get rid of this 3x on the righthand side. So let\\'s do that. Let\\'s subtract 3x from both sides, and we get on the lefthand side: 5x minus 3x is 2x plus 7 is greater than - 3x minus 3x - those cancel out. That was the whole point behind subtracting 3x from both sides - is greater than 3. Is greater than 3. No we can subtract 7 from both sides to get rid of this positive 7 right over here. So, let\\'s subtract, let\\'s subtract 7 from both sides. And we get on the lefthand side... 2x plus 7 minus 7 is just 2x. Is greater than 3 minus 7 which is negative 4. And then let\\'s see, we have 2x is greater than negative 4. If we just want an x over here, we can just divide both sides by 2. Since 2 is a positive number, we don\\'t have to swap the inequality. So let\\'s just divide both sides by 2, and we get x is greater than negative 4 divide by 2 is negative 2. So the solution will look like this. Draw the number line. I can draw a straighter number line than that. There we go. Still not that great, but it will serve our purposes. Let\\'s say that\\'s -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. X is greater than negative 2. It does not include negative 2. It is not greater than or equal to negative 2, so we have to exclude negative 2. And we exclude negative 2 by drawing an open circle at negative 2, but all the values greater than that are valid x\\'s that would solve, that would satisfy this inequality. So anything above it - anything above it will work. And let\\'s just try, let\\'s try just try something that should work. and then let\\'s try something that shouldn\\'t work. So 0 should work. It is greater than negative 2. It\\'s right over here. So, let\\'s verify that. 5 times 0 plus 7 should be greater than 3 times 0 plus 1. So this is 7 - \\'cause this is just a 0 - 7 should be greater than 3. Right. 3 times 1. So 7 should be greater than 3, and it definitely is. Now let\\'s try something that should not work. Let\\'s try negative 3. So 5 times negative 3... 5 times negative 3 plus 7, let\\'s see if it is greater than 3 times negative 3 plus 1. So this is negative 15 plus 7 is negative 8 That is negative 8. Let\\'s see if that is greater than negative 3 plus 1 is negative 2 times 3 is negative 6. Negative 8 is not - is not greater than negative 6. Negative 8 is more negative than negative 6. It\\'s less than. So, it is good that negative 3 didn\\'t work \\'cause we didn\\'t include that in our solution set. So we tried something that is in our solution set and it did work. And something that is not, and it didn\\'t work. So we are feeling pretty good. '),\n",

       "  \"Let's do a few more problems\\nthat bring together the concepts that we learned\\nin the last two videos. So let's say we have the\\ninequality 4x plus 3 is less than negative 1. So let's find all of the\\nx's that satisfy this. So the first thing I'd like to\\ndo is get rid of this 3. So let's subtract 3 from both\\nsides of this equation. So the left-hand side is just\\ngoing to end up being 4x. These 3's cancel out. That just ends up with a zero. No reason to change the\\ninequality just yet. We're just adding and\\nsubtracting from both sides, in this case, subtracting. That doesn't change the\\ninequality as long as we're subtracting the same value. We have negative 1 minus 3. That is negative 4. Negative 1 minus 3\\nis negative 4. And then we'll want to-- let's\\nsee, we can divide both sides of this equation by 4. Once again, when you multiply\\nor divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number,\\nit doesn't change the inequality. So the left-hand\\nside is just x. x is less than negative 4\\ndivided by 4 is negative 1. x is less than negative 1. Or we could write this\\nin interval notation. All of the x's from negative\\ninfinity to negative 1, but not including negative\\n1, so we put a parenthesis right there. Let's do a slightly\\nharder one. Let's say we have 5x is greater\\nthan 8x plus 27. So let's get all our x's on the\\nleft-hand side, and the best way to do that is subtract\\n8x from both sides. So you subtract 8x\\nfrom both sides. The left-hand side becomes\\n5x minus 8x. That's negative 3x. We still have a greater\\nthan sign. We're just adding or subtracting\\nthe same quantities on both sides. These 8x's cancel out and you're\\njust left with a 27. So you have negative 3x\\nis greater than 27. Now, to just turn this into an\\nx, we want to divide both sides by negative 3. But remember, when you multiply\\nor divide both sides of an inequality by a negative\\nnumber, you swap the inequality. So if we divide both sides of\\nthis by negative 3, we have to swap this inequality. It will go from being\\na greater than sign to a less than sign. And just as a bit of a way that\\nI remember greater than is that the left-hand side\\njust looks bigger. This is greater than. If you just imagine this height,\\nthat height is greater than that height right there,\\nwhich is just a point. I don't know if that confuses\\nyou or not. This is less than. This little point\\nis less than the distance of that big opening. That's how I remember it. But anyway, 3x over\\nnegative 3. So now that we divided both\\nsides by a negative number, by negative 3, we swapped the\\ninequality from greater than to less than. And the left-hand side, the\\nnegative 3's cancel out. You get x is less than\\n27 over negative 3, which is negative 9. Or in interval notation, it\\nwould be everything from negative infinity to negative\\n9, not including negative 9. If you wanted to do it\\nas a number line, it would look like this. This would be negative 9, maybe\\nthis would be negative 8, maybe this would\\nbe negative 10. You would start at negative 9,\\nnot included, because we don't have an equal sign here, and\\nyou go everything less than that, all the way down, as we\\nsee, to negative infinity. Let's do a nice,\\nhairy problem. So let's say we have 8x minus\\n5 times 4x plus 1 is greater than or equal to negative 1\\nplus 2 times 4x minus 3. Now, this might seem very\\ndaunting, but if we just simplify it step by step, you'll\\nsee it's no harder than any of the other problems\\nwe've tackled. So let's just simplify this. You get 8x minus-- let's\\ndistribute this negative 5. So let me say 8x, and then\\ndistribute the negative 5. Negative 5 times 4x\\nis negative 20x. Negative 5-- when I say negative\\n5, I'm talking about this whole thing. Negative 5 times 1 is negative\\n5, and then that's going to be greater than or equal\\nto negative 1 plus 2 times 4x is 8x. 2 times negative 3\\nis negative 6. And now we can merge these two\\nterms. 8x minus 20x is negative 12x minus 5 is greater\\nthan or equal to-- we can merge these constant terms.\\nNegative 1 minus 6, that's negative 7, and then we\\nhave this plus 8x left over. Now, I like to get all my x\\nterms on the left-hand side, so let's subtract 8x from both\\nsides of this equation. I'm subtracting 8x. This left-hand side, negative\\n12 minus 8, that's negative 20. Negative 20x minus 5. Once again, no reason\\nto change the inequality just yet. All we're doing is simplifying\\nthe sides, or adding and subtracting from them. The right-hand side becomes--\\nthis thing cancels out, 8x minus 8x, that's 0. So you're just left\\nwith a negative 7. And now I want to get rid\\nof this negative 5. So let's add 5 to both sides\\nof this equation. The left-hand side, you're just\\nleft with a negative 20x. These 5's cancel out. No reason to change the\\ninequality just yet. Negative 7 plus 5, that's\\nnegative 2. Now, we're at an interesting\\npoint. We have negative 20x is greater\\nthan or equal to negative 2. If this was an equation, or\\nreally any type of an inequality, we want to divide\\nboth sides by negative 20. But we have to remember, when\\nyou multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a\\nnegative number, you have to swap the inequality. So let's remember that. So if we divide this side by\\nnegative 20 and we divide this side by negative 20, all I did\\nis took both of these sides divided by negative 20, we have\\nto swap the inequality. The greater than or equal to has\\nto become a less than or equal sign. And, of course, these cancel\\nout, and you get x is less than or equal to-- the\\nnegatives cancel out-- 2/20 is 1/10. If we were writing it in\\ninterval notation, the upper bound would be 1/10. Notice, we're including it,\\nbecause we have an equal sign, less than or equal, so we're\\nincluding 1/10, and we're going to go all the way down\\nto negative infinity, everything less than\\nor equal to 1/10. This is just another way\\nof writing that. And just for fun, let's\\ndraw the number line. Let's draw the number\\nline right here. This is maybe 0, that is 1. 1/10 might be over here. Everything less than\\nor equal to 1/10. So we're going to include the\\n1/10 and everything less than that is included in\\nthe solution set. And you could try out any\\nvalue less than 1/10 and verify that it will satisfy\\nthis inequality. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're told that\\nKayla wants to visit a friend who lives eight kilometers away. She'll ride the subway as far as she can before walking the rest of the way. First, she needs to buy an\\naccess pass that costs $5.50. There's also a fee of $1.25 per stop. This is an expensive subway. Kayla doesn't want to spend\\nmore than $15 on the trip. So she wants to know the largest number of stops she can afford. Let S represent the number\\nof stops that Kayla buys. So first, pause this video and see if you can write an inequality that describes how many stops, or that describes the\\nsituation that describes that she wants to take\\nas many stops as she can, but she doesn't wanna spend more than $15. All right, now let's do this together. So first, let's just\\nthink about an expression for how much she spends. So no matter what, she's\\ngoing to spend $5.50, so we can write it like this, so $5.50, that's what she's going to spend, even if she doesn't take any stops. And it's $1.25 per stop, and\\nS is the number of stops. So the amount she's going\\nto spend just from the stops is going to be $1.25 times S. So it's going to be plus $1.25 S. This is the upfront she has to spend, and this is how much she's\\ngoing to spend on stop. So this is an S right over here and I wrote a five right next to it, they look kind of similar. And we know that she doesn't\\nwant to spend more than $15. So she's willing to spend up to $15. So this total amount that she spends has to be less than or equal to $15. Or if we didn't write it\\nwith the dollar symbols, we would write 5.50 plus 1.25 S is going to be less than or equal to, or needs to be less than or equal to 15. Now that we've written this inequality, what is the number of stops\\nthat Kayla can afford? What's the largest number of\\nstops that she can afford? Pause this video and\\ntry to figure that out. Well, to figure that out,\\nwe just have to solve for S and then figure out what the largest S is that satisfies the inequality\\nonce we've solved for S. So the first thing I would do is subtract 5.50 from both sides. When we do that, we are\\nleft with 1.25 or $1.25 S is less than or equal to 9.50. And then I would divide\\nboth sides by 1.25. And since I'm dividing both\\nsides by a positive value, it doesn't change the\\ndirection of the inequality, 1.25 and then divide this by 1.25, 9.5 divide by 1.25 is equal to 7.6. So we get that S needs to be\\nless than or equal to 7.6. So we can't take a\\nfractional number of stops. So the largest number of\\nstops that Kayla can take is going to be seven stops. She can't take eight, and she can't take 7 1/2 or 7.6. So the largest number she\\ncan take is seven stops. So she can take as many as seven stops. And we are done. \"),\n",

So let's subtract 7 from both\\nsides to get rid of this 7 on the left-hand side. And so our left-hand side\\nis just going to be 5z.

Let's [? look at ?] the\\nother one over here. We have negative 3z is\\nless than or equal to 18. Now, to isolate the\\nz, we could just divide both sides of this\\ninequality by negative 3.

We're going to divide\\nit by negative 3. And then you have 18. We're going to divide\\nit by negative 3. But we're going to\\nswap the inequality. So the less than or equal\\nwill become greater than or equal to. And so these guys cancel out. Negative 3 divided\\nby negative 3 is 1. So we have z is greater than\\nor equal to 18 over negative 3 is negative 6. And remember, it's this\\nconstraint or this constraint. And this constraint right\\nover here boils down to this. And this one boils down to this. So our solution set--\\nz is less than 4 or z is greater than\\nor equal to negative 6. So let me make this clear. Let me rewrite it. So z could be less than\\n4 or z is greater than or equal to negative 6. It can satisfy\\neither one of these. And this is kind of\\ninteresting here. Let's plot these. So there's a number\\nline right over there. Let's say that 0 is over here. We have 1, 2, 3, 4\\nis right over there. And then negative 6. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. That's negative 6 over there. Now, let's think about\\nz being less than 4. We would put a circle around\\n4, since we're not including 4. And it'd be everything\\nless than 4. Now let's think\\nabout what z being greater than or equal to\\nnegative 6 would mean. That means you can\\ninclude negative 6. And it's everything-- let me\\ndo that in different color. It means you can\\ninclude negative 6. I want to do that--\\noh, here we go. It means you include negative 6. Let me do it in a\\nmore different color. Do it in orange.

If we're a number\\ndown here, we're going to meet this constraint. And you could just try it\\nout with a bunch of numbers. 0 will work. 0 plus 7 is 7, which\\nis less than 27. And 3 times 0 is less than 18,\\nso it meets both constraints. If we put 4 here, it should only\\nmeet one of the constraints. Negative 3 times 4 is negative\\n12, which is less than 18. So it meets this constraint, but\\nit won't meet this constraint. Because you do 5\\ntimes 4 plus 7 is 27, which is not less than 27. It's equal to 27. Remember, this is an or.

So y is greater than negative\\n14 and-- let\\'s remember, we have this \"and\" here-- and\\ny is less than negative 7. So we have to meet both of\\nthese constraints over here.

So you have negative\\n13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7-- that\\'s negative 7-- and\\nthen negative 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. This would be 0,\\nand then you could keep going up more positive. And so we\\'re looking\\nfor all of the y\\'s that are less than negative 7. So let\\'s look at this,\\nless than negative 7. So not including\\nnegative 7, so we\\'ll do an open circle\\naround negative 7, and less than negative 7. And if that was the\\nonly constraint, we would keep going to the left.

And if you didn\\'t have\\nthis other constraint, you would keep going. But the y\\'s that\\nsatisfy both of them are all of the y\\'s in between. These are the y\\'s that are\\nboth less than negative 7 and greater than negative 14. And we can verify\\nthat things here work. So let\\'s try some values out. So a value that\\nwould work, well, let me just do\\nnegative 10 is right here, 8, 9, this is negative 10. That should work. So let\\'s try it out. So we\\'d have 3 times\\nnegative 10 plus 7 should be less than 2\\ntimes negative 10. So this is negative 30 plus\\n7 is negative 23, which is indeed less than negative 20. So that works. And negative 10 has to\\nwork for this one as well. So you have 4 times negative 10,\\nwhich is negative 40, plus 8. Negative 40 plus 8 should\\nbe greater than negative 48. Well, negative 40\\nplus 8 is negative 32. We\\'re going 8 in the\\npositive direction, so we\\'re getting less negative. And negative 32 is\\ngreater than negative 48. It\\'s less negative. So this works. So negative 10 works. Now, let\\'s just verify some\\nthings that shouldn\\'t work. So 0 should not work. It\\'s not in the solution set. So let\\'s try it out. We\\'ve got 3 times is 0 plus 7. That would be 7. And 7 is not less than 0. So it would violate this\\ncondition right over here if we put a 0 over here. If you put a negative\\n15 over here, it should violate this\\ncondition right over here because it wasn\\'t in\\nthis guy\\'s solution set. Anyway, hopefully you\\nfound that useful. '),\n",

       "  'Solve for x, 5x - 3 is less than 12 \"and\" 4x plus 1 is greater than 25. So let\\'s just solve for X in each of these constraints and keep in mind that any x has to satisfy both of them because it\\'s an \"and\" over here so first we have this 5 x minus 3 is less than 12 so if we want to isolate the x we can get rid of this negative 3 here by adding 3 to both sides so let\\'s add 3 to both sides of this inequality. The left-hand side, we\\'re just left with a 5x, the minus 3 and the plus 3 cancel out. 5x is less than 12 plus 3 is 15. Now we can divide both sides by positive 5, that won\\'t swap the inequality since 5 is positive. So we divide both sides by positive 5 and we are left with just from this constraint that x is less than 15 over 5, which is 3. So that constraint over here. But we have the second constraint as well. We have this one, we have 4x plus 1 is greater than 25. So very similarly we can subtract one from both sides to get rid of that one on the left-hand side. And we get 4x, the ones cancel out. is greater than 25 minus one is 24. Divide both sides by positive 4 Don\\'t have to do anything to the inequality since it\\'s a positive number. And we get x is greater than 24 over 4 is 6. And remember there was that \"and\" over here. We have this \"and\". So x has to be less than 3 \"and\" x has to be greater than 6. So already your brain might be realizing that this is a little bit strange. This first constraint says that x needs to be less than 3 so this is 3 on the number line. We\\'re saying x has to be less than 3 so it has to be in this shaded area right over there. This second constraint says that x has to be greater than 6. So if this is 6 over here, it says that x has to greater than 6. It can\\'t even include 6. And since we have this \"and\" here. The only x-es that are a solution for this compound inequality are the ones that satisfy both. The ones that are in the overlap of their solution set. But when you look at it right over here it\\'s clear that there is no overlap. There is no x that is both greater than 6 \"and\" less than 3. So in this situation we have no solution. '),\n",

       "  'We\\'re asked to solve for x. And we have this\\ncompound inequality here, negative 16 is less than or\\nequal to 3x plus 5, which is less than or equal to 20. And really, there\\'s two\\nways to approach it, which are really the same way. And I\\'ll do both of them. And I\\'ll actually do both\\nof them simultaneously. So one is to just solve\\nthis compound inequality all at once. And I\\'ll just rewrite it. Negative 16 is less than or\\nequal to 3x plus 5, which is less than or equal to 20. And the other way\\nis to think of it as two separate inequalities,\\nbut both of them need to be true. So you could also view it as\\nnegative 16 has to be less than or equal to 3x plus 5. And 3x plus 5 needs to be\\nless than or equal to 20. This statement and this\\nstatement are equivalent. This one may seem a little\\nbit more familiar because we can independently solve\\neach of these inequalities and just remember the \"and.\" This one might seem a little\\nless traditional because now we have three sides\\nto the statement. We have three parts of\\nthis compound inequality. But what we can see\\nis that we\\'re actually going to solve it\\nthe exact same way. In any situation, we really just\\nwant to isolate the x on one side of the inequality,\\nor in this case, one part of the\\ncompound inequality. Well, the best way to\\nisolate this x right here is to first get rid of\\nthis positive 5 that\\'s sitting in the middle. So let\\'s subtract\\n5 from every part of this compound inequality. So I\\'m going to subtract\\n5 there, subtract 5 there, and subtract\\n5 over there. And so we get negative 16\\nminus 5 is negative 21, is less than or equal to 3x\\nplus 5 minus 5 is 3x, which is less than or equal to\\n20 minus 5, which is 15. And we could essentially\\ndo the same thing here. If we want to isolate the 3x, we\\ncan subtract 5 from both sides. We get negative 21. Negative 21 is less\\nthan or equal to 3x. And we get, subtracting\\n5 from both sides. And notice, we\\'re\\njust subtracting 5 from every part of this\\ncompound inequality. We get 3x is less\\nthan or equal to 15. So this statement and this\\nstatement, once again, are the exact same thing. Now, going back here, if\\nwe want to isolate the x, we can divide by 3. And we have to do it to\\nevery part of the inequality. And since 3 is positive, we\\ndon\\'t have to change the sign. So let\\'s divide every part of\\nthis compound inequality by 3. You divide every part by 3. This is equivalent to\\ndividing every part of each of these inequalities by 3. And then we get negative 21\\ndivided by 3 is negative 7, is less than or equal\\nto x, which is less than or equal to 15\\ndivided by 3 is 5. You do it here. You get negative 7 is\\nless than or equal to x, and x is less than or\\nequal to 15/3, which is 5. This statement and this\\nstatement are completely equal. And we\\'ve solved for x. We\\'ve given you\\nthe solution set. And if we want to graph\\nit on a number line, it would look like this. This is 0. This is 5. This is negative 7. Our solution set includes\\neverything between negative 7 and 5, including\\nnegative 7 and 5. So we have to fill in\\nthe circles on negative 7 and positive 5. And it is everything in between. That\\'s our solution set. And so we can verify\\nthat these work. You could try out\\na number that\\'s well inside of our\\nsolution set, like 0. 3 times 0 is 0. So you\\'re just left\\nwith 5 is greater than or equal to negative\\n16, which is true. And 5 is less than\\nor equal to 20. Or negative 16 is less than or\\nequal to 5, which is less than or equal to 20. So that works, and\\nthat makes sense. You could try 5. If you put 5 here,\\nyou get 3 times 5 plus 5-- well, that\\'s just 20. Negative 16 is less than or\\nequal to 20, which is less than or equal to 20. That works. Negative 7 should also work. 3 times negative 7 is negative\\n21, plus 5 is negative 16. So you get negative\\n16, which is less than or equal to negative 16, which\\nis less than or equal to 20. And you could try other values. You could go outside\\nof our solution set. Try something like 10. 10 should not work. And you see here, if you put 10\\nhere, you get 3 times 10 plus 5 is 35. Negative 16 is less\\nthan or equal to 35, but 35 is not less\\nthan or equal to 20. And that\\'s why 10 is not\\npart of our solution set. '),\n",

       "  'Let\\'s do some compound\\ninequality problems, and these are just inequality problems\\nthat have more than one set of constraints. You\\'re going to see what I\\'m\\ntalking about in a second. So the first problem I have is\\nnegative 5 is less than or equal to x minus 4, which is\\nalso less than or equal to 13. So we have two sets of\\nconstraints on the set of x\\'s that satisfy these equations. x minus 4 has to be greater than\\nor equal to negative 5 and x minus 4 has to be less\\nthan or equal to 13. So we could rewrite this\\ncompound inequality as negative 5 has to be less than\\nor equal to x minus 4, and x minus 4 needs to be less\\nthan or equal to 13. And then we could solve each of\\nthese separately, and then we have to remember this \"and\"\\nthere to think about the solution set because it has to\\nbe things that satisfy this equation and this equation. So let\\'s solve each of\\nthem individually. So this one over here,\\nwe can add 4 to both sides of the equation. The left-hand side, negative\\n5 plus 4, is negative 1. Negative 1 is less than\\nor equal to x, right? These 4\\'s just cancel out here\\nand you\\'re just left with an x on this right-hand side. So the left, this part right\\nhere, simplifies to x needs to be greater than or equal to\\nnegative 1 or negative 1 is less than or equal to x. So we can also write\\nit like this. X needs to be greater than\\nor equal to negative 1. These are equivalent. I just swapped the sides. Now let\\'s do this other\\ncondition here in green. Let\\'s add 4 to both sides\\nof this equation. The left-hand side,\\nwe just get an x. And then the right-hand\\nside, we get 13 plus 14, which is 17. So we get x is less than\\nor equal to 17. So our two conditions, x has to\\nbe greater than or equal to negative 1 and less than\\nor equal to 17. So we could write this\\nagain as a compound inequality if we want. We can say that the solution\\nset, that x has to be less than or equal to 17 and greater\\nthan or equal to negative 1. It has to satisfy both\\nof these conditions. So what would that look\\nlike on a number line? So let\\'s put our number\\nline right there. Let\\'s say that this is 17. Maybe that\\'s 18. You keep going down. Maybe this is 0. I\\'m obviously skipping a bunch\\nof stuff in between. Then we would have a negative\\n1 right there, maybe a negative 2. So x is greater than or equal\\nto negative 1, so we would start at negative 1. We\\'re going to circle it in\\nbecause we have a greater than or equal to. And then x is greater than that,\\nbut it has to be less than or equal to 17. So it could be equal to\\n17 or less than 17. So this right here is a solution\\nset, everything that I\\'ve shaded in orange. And if we wanted to write it in\\ninterval notation, it would be x is between negative 1 and\\n17, and it can also equal negative 1, so we put\\na bracket, and it can also equal 17. So this is the interval notation\\nfor this compound inequality right there. Let\\'s do another one. Let me get a good\\nproblem here. Let\\'s say that we have\\nnegative 12. I\\'m going to change the problem\\na little bit from the one that I\\'ve found here. Negative 12 is less than 2 minus\\n5x, which is less than or equal to 7. I want to do a problem that has\\njust the less than and a less than or equal to. The problem in the book that\\nI\\'m looking at has an equal sign here, but I want to remove\\nthat intentionally because I want to show you\\nwhen you have a hybrid situation, when you have\\na little bit of both. So first we can separate this\\ninto two normal inequalities. You have this inequality\\nright there. We know that negative 12 needs\\nto be less than 2 minus 5x. That has to be satisfied, and--\\nlet me do it in another color-- this inequality also\\nneeds to be satisfied. 2 minus 5x has to be less than\\n7 and greater than 12, less than or equal to 7 and greater\\nthan negative 12, so and 2 minus 5x has to be less\\nthan or equal to 7. So let\\'s just solve this the\\nway we solve everything. Let\\'s get this 2 onto the\\nleft-hand side here. So let\\'s subtract 2 from both\\nsides of this equation. So if you subtract 2 from both\\nsides of this equation, the left-hand side becomes negative\\n14, is less than-- these cancel out-- less\\nthan negative 5x. Now let\\'s divide both\\nsides by negative 5. And remember, when you multiply\\nor divide by a negative number, the inequality\\nswaps around. So if you divide both sides by\\nnegative 5, you get a negative 14 over negative 5, and you have\\nan x on the right-hand side, if you divide that by\\nnegative 5, and this swaps from a less than sign to\\na greater than sign. The negatives cancel out, so you\\nget 14/5 is greater than x, or x is less than 14/5,\\nwhich is-- what is this? This is 2 and 4/5. x is less than 2 and 4/5. I just wrote this improper\\nfraction as a mixed number. Now let\\'s do the other\\nconstraint over here in magenta. So let\\'s subtract 2 from both\\nsides of this equation, just like we did before. And actually, you can do these\\nsimultaneously, but it becomes kind of confusing. So to avoid careless mistakes, I\\nencourage you to separate it out like this. So if you subtract 2 from both\\nsides of the equation, the left-hand side becomes\\nnegative 5x. The right-hand side, you have\\nless than or equal to. The right-hand side becomes\\n7 minus 2, becomes 5. Now, you divide both sides\\nby negative 5. On the left-hand side,\\nyou get an x. On the right-hand side, 5\\ndivided by negative 5 is negative 1. And since we divided by a\\nnegative number, we swap the inequality. It goes from less than or\\nequal to, to greater than or equal to. So we have our two\\nconstraints. x has to be less than 2 and 4/5,\\nand it has to be greater than or equal to negative 1. So we could write\\nit like this. x has to be greater than or\\nequal to negative 1, so that would be the lower bound on our\\ninterval, and it has to be less than 2 and 4/5. And notice, not less\\nthan or equal to. That\\'s why I wanted to show you,\\nyou have the parentheses there because it can\\'t be\\nequal to 2 and 4/5. x has to be less\\nthan 2 and 4/5. Or we could write this way. x has to be less than 2 and\\n4/5, that\\'s just this inequality, swapping the\\nsides, and it has to be greater than or equal\\nto negative 1. So these two statements\\nare equivalent. And if I were to draw it\\non a number line, it would look like this. So you have a negative 1, you\\nhave 2 and 4/5 over here. Obviously, you\\'ll have\\nstuff in between. Maybe, you know, 0\\nsitting there. We have to be greater than or\\nequal to negative 1, so we can be equal to negative 1. And we\\'re going to be greater\\nthan negative 1, but we also have to be less than\\n2 and 4/5. So we can\\'t include\\n2 and 4/5 there. We can\\'t be equal to 2 and 4/5,\\nso we can only be less than, so we put a empty circle\\naround 2 and 4/5 and then we fill in everything below that,\\nall the way down to negative 1, and we include negative 1\\nbecause we have this less than or equal sign. So the last two problems I did\\nare kind of \"and\" problems. You have to meet both of\\nthese constraints. Now, let\\'s do an \"or\" problem. So let\\'s say I have these\\ninequalities. Let\\'s say I\\'m given-- let\\'s say\\nthat 4x minus 1 needs to be greater than or equal to\\n7, or 9x over 2 needs to be less than 3. So now when we\\'re saying \"or,\"\\nan x that would satisfy these are x\\'s that satisfy either\\nof these equations. In the last few videos or in the\\nlast few problems, we had to find x\\'s that satisfied\\nboth of these equations. Here, this is much\\nmore lenient. We just have to satisfy\\none of these two. So let\\'s figure out the solution\\nsets for both of these and then we figure out\\nessentially their union, their combination, all of\\nthe things that\\'ll satisfy either of these. So on this one, on the one\\non the left, we can add 1 to both sides. You add 1 to both sides. The left-hand side just becomes\\n4x is greater than or equal to 7 plus 1 is 8. Divide both sides by 4. You get x is greater\\nthan or equal to 2. Or let\\'s do this one. Let\\'s see, if we multiply both\\nsides of this equation by 2/9, what do we get? If you multiply both sides by\\n2/9, it\\'s a positive number, so we don\\'t have to do anything\\nto the inequality. These cancel out, and you get\\nx is less than 3 times 2/9. 3/9 is the same thing as\\n1/3, so x needs to be less than 2/3. So or x is less than 2/3. So that\\'s our solution set. x needs to be greater than or\\nequal to 2, or less than 2/3. So this is interesting. Let me plot the solution\\nset on the number line. So that is our number line. Maybe this is 0, this is 1, this\\nis 2, 3, maybe that is negative 1. So x can be greater than\\nor equal to 2. So we could start-- let me\\ndo it in another color. We can start at 2 here and it\\nwould be greater than or equal to 2, so include everything\\ngreater than or equal to 2. That\\'s that condition\\nright there. Or x could be less than 2/3. So 2/3 is going to be right\\naround here, right? That is 2/3. x could be less than 2/3. And this is interesting. Because if we pick one of these\\nnumbers, it\\'s going to satisfy this inequality. If we pick one of these numbers,\\nit\\'s going to satisfy that inequality. If we had an \"and\" here, there\\nwould have been no numbers that satisfy it because you\\ncan\\'t be both greater than 2 and less than 2/3. So the only way that there\\'s\\nany solution set here is because it\\'s \"or.\" You can\\nsatisfy one of the two inequalities. Anyway, hopefully you,\\nfound that fun. '),\n",

       "  'Voiceover:We\\'ve seen\\nmultiple times in our life that distance can be\\nviewed as rate times time. What I want to do in this video is use this fairly simple\\nformula right over here, this fairly simple equation, to understand that units\\ncan really be viewed as algebraic objects, that you can treat them like variables as we work through a\\nformula or an equation, which could be really, really helpful to make sure that we\\'re\\ngetting the results in units that actually make sense. For example, if someone\\nwere to give you a rate, if they were to say a rate of, let\\'s say, 5 meters per second, and they were to give you a time, a time of 10 seconds, then we can pretty, in a\\npretty straightforward way, apply this formula. We say, well, distance\\nis equal to our rate, 5 meters per second times our time, times our time, which is 10 seconds. What\\'s neat here is we\\ncan treat the units, as I\\'ve just said, like\\nalgebraic constructs, kind of like variables, so this would be equal to, well, multiplication, it doesn\\'t matter what order we multiply in, so we can change the order. This is the same thing as 5 times 10, 5 times 10 times meters per second, times meters per second times seconds, times seconds. If we were to treat our units as these algebraic objects, we could say, hey, look, we have seconds divided by seconds, or you\\'re going to have\\nseconds in the denominator multiplied by seconds in the numerator. Those are going to cancel out, and 5 times 10, of course, is, 5 times 10, of course, is 50. We would be left with 50, and the units that we\\'re\\nleft with are the meters, 50 meters. That\\'s pretty neat. The units worked out. When we treated the units\\nout like algebraic objects, they worked out so that\\nour end units for distance were in meters, which\\nis a unit of distance. Now you\\'re saying, \"OK,\\nthat\\'s cute and everything, \"but this seems like a little\\nbit of too much overhead \"to worry about when I\\'m just doing \"a simple formula like this.\" But what I want to show you is that even with a simple formula like distance is equal to rate times time, what I just did could\\nactually be quite useful, and this thing that I\\'m\\ndoing is actually called dimensional analysis. It\\'s useful for something as simple as distance equals rate times time, but as you go into physics\\nand chemistry and engineering, you\\'ll see much, much, much more, I would say, hairy formulas. When you do the dimensional analysis, it makes sure that the\\nmath is working out right. It makes sure that you\\'re\\ngetting the right units. But even with this, let\\'s try a slightly\\nmore complicated example. Let\\'s say that our rate is, let\\'s say, let\\'s keep our\\nrate at 5 meters per second, but let\\'s say that\\nsomeone gave us the time. Instead of giving it in\\nseconds, they give it in hours, so they say the time is equal to 1 hour. Now let\\'s try to apply this formula. We\\'re going to get distance is\\nequal to 5 meters per second, 5 meters per second times\\ntime, which is 1 hour, times 1 hour. What\\'s that going to give us? The 5 times the 1, so we multiply the 5 times the 1, that\\'s just going to give us 5. But then remember, we have to treat the units algebraically. We\\'re going to do our\\ndimensional analysis, so it\\'s 5, so we have meters per second times hours, times hours, or you could say 5 meter hours per second. Well, this doesn\\'t look like a ... This isn\\'t a set of units that we know that makes sense to us. This doesn\\'t feel like our\\ntraditional units of distance, so we want to cancel this out in some way. It might jump out of you, well, if we can get rid of this hours, if we can express it in terms of seconds, then that would cancel here, and we\\'d be left with just the meters, which is a unit of distance\\nthat we\\'re familiar with. So how do we do that? We\\'d want to multiply this thing by something that has\\nhours in the denominator and seconds in the numerator, times essentially seconds per hour. How many seconds are there per hour? Well, there are 3,600 ... Let me do this in a ... I\\'ll do it in this color. There are 3,600 seconds per hour, or you could even say that there are 3,600 seconds for every 1 hour. Now when you multiply, these hours will cancel with these hours, these seconds will cancel\\nwith those seconds, and we are left with, we are left with 5 times 3,600. What is that? That\\'s 5 times 3,000 would be 15,000, 5 times 600 is another 3,000, so that is equal to 18,000. The only units that we\\'re left with, we just have the meters there. 18- Oh, it\\'s 18,000, 18,000, 18,000 meters. We\\'re done. We\\'ve now expressed our distance in terms of units that we recognize. If you go 5 meters per second for 1 hour, you will go 18,000 meters. But let\\'s just use our little dimensional analysis\\nmuscles a little bit more. What if we didn\\'t want\\nthe answer in meters but we wanted the answer in kilometers? What could we do? Well, we could take that 18,000 meters, 18,000 meters, and if we could multiply it by something that has meters in the denominator, meters in the denominator and kilometers in the numerator, then these meters would cancel out, and we\\'d be left with the kilometers. So what can we multiply it so we\\'re not really changing the value? We want to multiply it by essentially 1, so we want to write equivalent things in the numerator and the denominator. So 1 kilometer is equivalent to, equivalent to 1,000 meters. One way to think about it, we\\'re just multiplying this thing by 1, 1 kilometer over 1,000 meters. Well, 1 kilometer is 1,000 meters, so this thing is equivalent to 1. But what\\'s neat is when you multiply, we have meters canceling with meters, and so you\\'re left with\\n18,000 divided by 1,000 is equal to 18. And then the only units we\\'re left with is the kilometers, and we are done. We have re-expressed our distance instead of in meters in terms of kilometers. '),\n",

       "  \"So I have a car here, and\\nlet's say that in 3 hours, this car is able to\\ntravel 150 kilometers. So what I want to think\\nabout in this video is, what are some reasonable\\nways to express the rate at which this car\\ntraveled for those 3 hours? And I encourage you\\nto pause this video and think about it for yourself. One, you could\\ncalculate the rate. But also think about\\ndifferent units that you could use\\nto express that rate, and which ones would\\nbe useful-- which ones what would be\\nreasonable, and which ones would be unreasonable. So let's just remind\\nourselves what rate even is. So you could think\\nabout distance as being equal to\\nrate times time. Or you could imagine if you\\ndivide both sides by time, you could imagine that\\ndistance divided by time is equal to rate. So they've given us a distance,\\nthey've given us a time. So we could just divide the\\ndistance divided by the time to figure out the rates. And I'm going to\\nkeep the units here. Because it's really important\\nto recognize that the units, to some degree, they can also\\nbe manipulated algebraically. Now they aren't variables, but\\nthey follow the same rules, I guess I should say,\\nas a variable would. So for example, if\\nI said, look rate is distance divided by time. So I could say that my\\nrate in this situation is going to be 150 kilometers\\ndivided by 3 hours. So if we just look at\\nthe numeric part of this, what's 150 divided by 3? Well that's going to be 50. So this is going\\nto be equal to 50. But we can keep\\nthe units the way that they are, right over here. This is 50 kilometers per hour. This is what I meant\\nby saying look, we're dividing this quantity,\\nexpressed in kilometers, by this quantity,\\nexpressed in hours. We can divide the numeric\\npart, 150 divided by 3. But then we could leave at\\nthe units in that relationship that they were before. So you can kind of algebraically\\nkeep them that way. And you'll see in a\\nsecond we're going to manipulate them\\na lot more, using what's often called the\\ndimensional analysis. But anyway, this is a reasonable\\nway to express a rate. 50 kilometers per hour. I can imagine this. I can imagine that\\nin 1 hour, you're going to go 50 kilometers. Let's think about other ways\\nthat we could represent that. So 50 kilometers\\nper hour-- and this is where we're really going to\\ndo some dimensional analysis with our units. So 50 kilometers per hour. Let's say we want to\\nexpress it in terms of kilometers per second. So how could we write\\n50 kilometers per hour, in terms of\\nkilometers per second? Well it's always good, actually,\\nas a first approximation, to just think about it. If you went this far in an hour,\\nthen the number of kilometers you go in a second, is that\\ngoing to be less, or more? Well a second's a much,\\nmuch shorter period of time. There's 3,600\\nseconds in an hour. So you're going to go\\n1/3,600 of this distance. But let's think about\\nhow we would actually work out with the units. Well, we want to get rid of\\nthis hours in the denominator. And the plural,\\nobviously the grammar doesn't hold up\\nwith the algebra, but this could be hour or hours. So we could think\\nabout well, 1 hour-- I'll write an hour in\\nthe numerator that's going to cancel with this\\nhour in the denominator. But we want it in\\nterms of seconds. So 1 hour is equal\\nto how many seconds? Well 1 hour is equal\\nto 3,600 seconds. This is what I meant\\nby saying that using dimensional analysis, which\\nis what I'm doing right now, we can essentially\\nmanipulate these units, as we would traditionally\\ndo with a variable. So we have hours\\ndivided by hours. And so when we do\\nthe multiplication, we can multiply\\nthe numeric parts. So we have 50 times\\n1, divided by 3,600. Let me write that. 50 times 1 over 3,600. And then our units left\\nare kilometers per second. Or I could say seconds. So we can play around with\\nthe plural and singular parts of it, but I'll just write\\nit as kilometers per second. And so this is 50/3,600. And this fits our intuition. In a second, you're going to go\\n1/3,600 as far as you would go in an hour. But let's actually think\\nabout what this is equal to. 50/3,600-- so this is\\ngoing to be the same thing, as-- Let me just\\nsimplify it over here. So 50/3,600 is the\\nsame thing as 5/360, which is the same thing as-- let\\nme write it this way-- 10/720. And I did that way because\\nthat makes it clear that that's the\\nsame thing as 1/72. So you could write\\nthis as, you're going, this is equal to 1/72 of\\na kilometer per second. Now I would claim\\nthat this is not so reasonable of units for\\nthis example right over here. 1/72 of a kilometer\\nevery second? That doesn't help me too much. I guess I'll know\\nthat in 72 seconds I will have gone a kilometer. But this is something that's\\nkind of strange for me to conceptualize. If I wanted to get\\nmy calculator out, 1/72, 1 divided by\\n72-- if someone said, hey, I'm going 0.0139\\nkilometers in a second, that doesn't seem to make a\\nlot of conceptual sense to me. So I would say that\\nthis, right over here, is a very reasonable\\nway to express our rate. This one seems like more\\nof an unreasonable way. But we could salvage this. Because we're going 1/72\\nof a kilometer per second. Now this is a small\\nnumber, but how could we make it much larger? Well, what if we\\nthought in terms of, not kilometers per\\nsecond, but if we thought in terms of\\nmeters per second. A kilometer's 1,000 meters. So if we think about this in\\nterms of meters per second, we're going to get a\\nlarger number here, in fact larger by\\na factor of 1,000. So let's think about that. Let's try to convert this\\nkilometers to meters. So how would we do that? Well, once again, if\\nwe have kilometers in the denominator\\nthis kilometer will cancel with that kilometer. And we want a meter\\nin the numerator. So we want to think about\\nhow many meters are there per kilometer. Well there's 1,000\\nmeters per kilometer. Kilometers cancel out, and we\\nare left with 1,000 times 1-- I'll just write that\\nas 1,000-- over 72. And now we're left\\nwith in the numerator, we're left with the\\nunit meters per second. And I know I keep writing\\nsecond in different ways. Oftentimes actually you'll see\\npeople write second like that. So actually let me\\njust go with that. So s is second, is seconds,\\nis sec, just like that. So is this fairly reasonable? Well actually, this\\nfeels pretty good. Let's get our calculator out\\nand figure out what that is. So 1,000 divided by 72\\ngives us 13, if I round, that's about 13.9. So this is approximately equal\\nto 13.9 meters per second. Which I can visualize. I can imagine how\\nfar 13.9 meters is, and of doing that\\ndistance in one second. So this actually also\\nseems like a reasonable way to express the rate. So I could say hey, this thing's\\ngoing 50 kilometers per hour. I can imagine it going roughly\\n13.9 meters per second. So this is reasonable as well. But to say it's going 1/72\\nof a kilometer per second doesn't really\\nseem to make sense. And also, if I try to think\\nabout it in terms of meters per hour, that also\\nwould be strange. Actually, I encourage\\nyou to calculate it. Try to convert this right\\nover here to meters per hour. Then we would say well, we\\ncould use the same thing here. That's going to be 1,000\\nmeters for every 1 kilometer. Kilometers cancel out. And I'm going to be\\nleft with 50 times 1,000 is 50,000 meters per hour. So I have trouble\\nimagining-- well, obviously if I convert\\nto kilometers in my head I could imagine it-- but this\\nis kind of a crazy large number. 50,000 meters per hour. So at least in my eyes,\\nusing kilometers per hour to describe this\\nrate seems useful. Describing this rate as meters\\nper second seems useful. But describing it as kilometers\\nper second, or meters per hour, seem a little bit unusual. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] So I have data here on two different websites, website A and website B. And my question to you is, which one is more productive? And some of you might be asking yourself, what does it mean to be productive? And at a very high level, you could view productivity\\nas how effective something is at producing. So for a given amount of input into the process, how much output are you getting? If you want to get a\\nlittle bit more exact, you could view it as the\\nrate of output per input. But that still makes us ask the question, what are the inputs and\\nwhat are the outputs? So pause this video and think about how you would measure productivity for or how you would compare the productivity of these two websites. And there's multiple ways to do it. All right, now let's\\nthink through it together. What I'm first going to do is look at each of these lines and think about whether they are\\nan input or an output. So the number of writers, well, you need the writers to produce the website. So I would consider that an input. Although if you were the head of HR, the person who is hiring writers, the head of human resources, and you were hiring writers, then that could actually be an output. But if we're just thinking about creating a website, we need writers to create\\nit so that's an input. Number of posts posted, average number of words of post, average likes of post, average comments of post, number of new subscribers, those all feel like outputs. If the writers do a good job, they're going to produce a lot of posts, they're going to, I guess,\\nhave a lot of words, I don't know if it's good to always be wordy. People will like their posts, they'll comment on those posts. We'll have new subscribers. So this is all output. What about revenue? That's how much money a site brings in before having to pay its expenses. So that also should be an output because if the writers do a good job, if the site is well run, they will generate a lot of revenue. What about expenses? Well, you need to use expenses. You need to spend expenses on\\nthings like writer salaries in order to create your website, in order to generate that revenue. So I would consider that an input. And what about profit? Profit is all the money you bring in minus your expenses and\\nhow much you get leftover. Well, some people would argue the\\nwhole point of a business is to generate that profit. That is an outcome you want\\nto maximize, an output. And so I would consider that an output. And so the question of\\nproductivity really just boils down to which output or what combinations of output do we want\\nto figure out the rate that we're generating\\nrelative to some input or some combination of inputs? So a really simple way\\nof measuring productivity in this situation, let's define it, productivity. And once again, there's multiple ways of defining it. Let's say it is equal to the profit per number of writers. So it could be profit over\\nthe number of writers. If we define it that way, which website is more productive? Well, website A, in that definition, A would have a productivity of $10,000 for five writers. So it would be $2,000 profit per writer. And what would be B's per\\nactivity by this definition? Well, $28,000 divided by 11, 28,000 divided by 11 writers, there's $28,000 in profit. That gives us a 2,000, and we'll round, 2,545. So approximately $2,545\\nof profit per writer. So based on this\\nmeasurement of productivity, it looks like website B is more productive. Now what if we did maybe\\neven a simpler one, or maybe one that you might think is even more natural? What if we thought about it as the number of posts per writer? So let's do it that way. So if we just defined productivity, I'll just do that, as being equal to the number of posts divided by the writers. Well, in this situation, website A would have a productivity of 110 divided by five, which would be 22, 22 posts per writer, and website B 200 divided by 11 , 200 divided by 11 gets us, well, we could just\\nround that to maybe 18, since we want to get rough estimates, to 18 posts per writer. So by this measure of productivity, website A actually looks more productive. So hopefully this gives\\nyou just a general sense of what productivity is, and an appreciation that\\nthere's multiple ways of measuring it. And you could do much fancier things, you could say, you could make it a whole combination of outputs divided by a\\ncombination of inputs. So you could define\\nproductivity as the number of posts posted times the\\naverage number of posts, you take that quantity, and then maybe add the\\naverage likes per post or multiply by the average likes per post, and then add to that the comments per post or multiply by the comments per post and then divide by the number of writers or the number of writers and expenses or divide just by the expenses. But the general notion is you\\nwanna take some combination of the outputs, maybe even just one\\noutput and divide it by some combination of the inputs\\nand you can actually decide how you even wanna combine, how you wanna mathematically combine those outputs and inputs. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Instructor] We\\'re told that Marvin has an inflatable wading\\npool in his back yard. The pool is cylindrical with a base area of four square meters and\\na height of 60 centimeters. What is the volume of\\nthe pool in cubic meters? Pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. All right, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. And let\\'s just first visualize what this cylindrical\\nwading pool would look like. It would look something like this. A wading pool\\'s kind of a small pool where you can just hang out a bit in it. You\\'re not necessarily gonna\\nswim around too much in it. So it might look something like this. I know I\\'m not drawing it perfectly. It\\'s kind of a hand-drawn situation, and I\\'m making it transparent\\nso that we can see the base. So the wading pool would\\nlook something like that. They tell us that we have a\\nbase area of four square meters. So this area right over\\nhere, that\\'s the base. That is four square meters. And it has a height of 60 centimeters, tell us that right over there. So this height is 60 centimeters. So the volume, our\\nreaction might be to say, \"Okay, the volume of a cylinder\\nis the area of the base times the height.\" And so in this case, why wouldn\\'t we just take four times 60, times 60, and we would\\nget a volume of 240. And we want it in cubic meters, so we just say 240 cubic meters. Is this true? Did I just do this correctly? Well, some of you might have realized that what I just multiplied, I didn\\'t multiply four square meters times 60 meters to get 240 cubic meters. I just multiplied four square meters times 60, 60 centimeters. And if you multiply these two things, your actual units would\\nnot be cubic meters. You would end up of units of\\nmeters squared centimeters, which is not what they want and that is kind of a\\nbizarre set of units. So in order to get the\\nanswer in cubic meters, we would wanna re-express 60\\ncentimeters in terms of meters. Well, how many meters is 60 centimeters? Well, 100 centimeters make a meter. So I could write it this way. So 100 centimeters equal one meter. Or another way you could think about it is one centimeter is equal\\nto 1/100 of a meter. And so 60 centimeters is going to be equal to 60/100 of a meter. So now we can apply this, \\'cause we\\'re dealing with\\nmeters consistently now. So we can say, so this is actually wrong. We could say the volume\\nis going to be equal to the base in square meters, and I\\'m gonna write the units down and make sure we\\'re doing the right thing, times the height, times\\n60 over 100 meters. And now everything works out. Four times 60 over 100 is\\ngoing to be 240 over 100. And then meters squared times meter, we are left with cubic meters, which is exactly what they asked us for. And of course, we could rewrite\\nthis as 2.4 cubic meters. And we are done. '),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're told\\nthat Hannah and Martine each got a plant for their home. Hannah measured that her plant grows, on average, 2 centimeters per week. Martine measured that her plant grows, on average, 3 millimeters per day. Which plant grows faster? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out on your own. All right, now let's go\\nthrough this together. So at first when you look at it, you might just compare 3 to 2 and say, oh, 3 is larger than 2, therefore maybe Martine's\\nplant grows faster. And you would think that\\nuntil you look at the units. This is millimeters per day while for Hannah's plant it's in centimeters per week. So in order to really compare them we have to convert them to the same units in both length and time. So let's convert both of them, let's convert them both\\nto centimeters per week. You could just try to convert both of them to millimeters per day or I guess you could try\\nto convert both of them to meters per year, a third set of units, but centimeters per week seems reasonable since we already have\\nHannah's plant rate at, so let me write this down. So Hannah, I'll just write H, grows at 2 centimeters per week. And then you have Martine, grows at an average of\\n3 millimeters per day. Now how do we convert\\n3 millimeters per day to centimeters per week? Well, first we could\\nconvert the millimeters, actually, first, let's\\nconvert the days into weeks. So how many days are there in a week? Well, there's 7 days in a week. So if we have how many\\nmillimeters per day, if we wanted to know millimeters per week we would multiply times 7 days. So let me do that. So times 7 days in a week. That would get us, this would be equal to 3 times 7 which is equal to 21 millimeters in a week. And you can see, actually, that the units cancel\\nout nicely like that, so you're left with millimeters a week. And that makes sense, 3 millimeters a day, you're able to do 7 times that in a week, 21 millimeters a week. And then when you think\\nabout 21 millimeters is how many centimeters? Well, we just have to remember that 1 centimeter is\\nequal to 10 millimeters, so if we wanna covert\\nthis into centimeters, we essentially have to divide by 10. We could just say 1/10 of\\na centimeter per millimeter and then that gets us, we could write it in different ways, but we could write this, and even here the units cancel out nicely, 21 divided by 10 is 2.1\\ncentimeters per week. Another way you could\\nhave just thought about it is we could say 1 centimeter\\nis equal to 10 millimeters, or if you divide both sides by 10, 1/10 of a centimeter is\\nequal to 1 millimeter, and if 1 millimeter is equal\\nto 1/10 of a centimeter then 21 millimeters is just\\ngoing to be 21 times this, 21 times 1/10 is the same\\nthing as 21 divided by 10, it would be 2.1 centimeters. And so now we can compare\\n2.1 centimeters per week compared to 2 centimeters a week. Well, it turns out that when you actually compare\\nthe appropriate units it still turns out that Martine's plant is growing just a little bit faster. \"),\n",

       "  \"- In this video, we're going to talk a little\\nbit about measurement. and the idea that you really can't measure exactly the dimensions of something. And I know what you' re thinking, You' re like, well, no, of course, we can measure the\\ndimensions of something. Let's say I have some type of a gear over here. So let me draw my gear, and if I were to ask you, that's\\nnot the best drawing gear, but if I were to ask you, what's the inner diameter\\nof the hole of the gear, right over here? Maybe you take a ruler\\nout, right over here. So this is my ruler. And that you are able to\\nsee when you measure it, that it is one centimeter in diameter. But then I say, is it\\nexactly one centimeter? And then you realize, well, yeah, let me get a\\nlittle bit more precise. Maybe you get a magnifying glass out here. So this is the lens of\\nmy magnifying glass. And you zoom in a little bit. Maybe you get a better ruler that marks off the millimeters and you actually say, Oh, well, when I look a little bit closer, it actually turns out it's\\nnot exactly one centimeter. It's actually closer to 1.1 centimeters. And then I ask you, is that exactly the inner\\ndiameter of this gear here? And like, okay, well let\\nme get out of microscope. And then you realize, Oh, you' re right, it's\\nactually 1.089 centimeters. And then I ask you, is that exactly right? And then you' re like,\\nyeah, I guess you' re right. I haven't measured to the nearest, to the height or the width of an atom, to do that I would need\\na lot more precision right over here. And so maybe I need some type\\nof an electron microscope, but even if you're able to do that, and that would be many decimal places to the right of the decimal point here, if you're measuring in centimeters, you can still ask, was\\nis that exactly right? Maybe you can measure the parts of an atom or to a measurement even\\nsmaller than an atom And if later on, you might\\nstudy quantum physics and there are some levels of granularity where you can't get a true\\nmeasurement below that, but as you can see, it\\nis somewhat arbitrary for our everyday life. And so the question is,\\nwhich one do you pick? Or how much trouble do you get? Or how much trouble do you take to get to these different\\nlevels of precision? And the answer is, it just depends. If the goal was, hey, we just\\nwanna make multiple copies of maybe jewelry of this little car gear, so we're gonna wanna put, some type of, I don't know, gold chain through it. And we say, hey, we need\\nat least three quarters of a centimeter in order to get the rope or the chain through it. Well then this first measurement,\\nthat's enough precision. But if I told you this gear is going to be an essential\\npart of the space shuttle, or some type of really\\nimportant machinery, that has really fine tolerances, I guess people aren't\\nusing the spacial anymore, but some finally engineered automobile or something that's going\\nto have a lot of needs, really close tolerances it needs to be really, really precise. Well then even this 1.089\\ncentimeters might not be enough. You might have to get to something like it's 1.089203 centimeters, to be able to be really,\\nreally finely crafted. We're nowhere close\\nwith our everyday tools to get anywhere close to say the width or the height of an atom and you could even theory\\nmeasure within the atom. And so you just have to think about what the measurement is for. I'll give another example, this right over here is a\\npicture of Mount Everest. You might know it as the\\ntallest mountain in the world. And if you were to ask someone,\\nhow tall is Mount Everest? If you were to do a web\\nsearch for it right now, you would find that it\\nis 8,848 meters tall. Now, this is clearly\\nrounded to the nearest meter because if you were to go\\nto the top of Mount Everest, you'll see little pebbles. In fact, those pebbles might move around. And so the actual precise\\nheight of Mount Everest might change actually second by second, depending if rain is\\nfalling, snow is falling, how the wind is moving\\ndifferent pebbles around, but for most of our daily\\npurposes, this is sufficient. In fact, for a lot of us, we might not even need\\nthis level of precision. We might say, hey, it's roughly or it's approximately, we'd estimate that it's about 9,000 meters. But there are applications where you would need at least\\nthis level of precision, or maybe something even more precise. For example, if you wanted to compare it to another mountain, say K2, which is the second tallest\\nmountain in the world. And let's say they are close in height, and actually, if you were\\nto do a Google search, you would see that K2, has\\na height of 8,611 meters rounded to the nearest meter. You'd see that, that\\n9,000 meter approximation. It wouldn't be enough if you're round to the\\nnearest kilometer, I guess, that wouldn't be enough to be able to compare Mount Everest to K2, because rounded to the nearest kilometer, they're both approximately\\nnine kilometers. So this is approximately\\n9,000 meters as well. So you would need more precision. If you wanted to answer\\nwhich one is taller, you'd have to get at least\\nto the closest hundred meter. And then there's reasons why you might wanna get even more precise. Maybe you wanna create a\\nslide from the top of K2 to the bottom of K2. And so you can imagine\\nif your slide is too long by, let's say three meters, what's going to be hard to\\nget on that slide on the top, or it's going to dig into\\nthe snow at the bottom. And if your slide is too\\nshort by three meters, that's a pretty unpleasant\\nthing to have you go on this seemingly super fun slide, you have to drop nine feet at the end, or really if you' re off, what if you're off by 10 meters and you're gonna drop 30 feet off the end, which could really break some bones and be unpleasant. So the big takeaway is, it's very hard to measure\\nanything perfectly precisely. And you have to think about, what's the application? What are you trying to answer? What are you trying to\\njudge about those things? To determine how much precision you need in your measurement. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Narrator] We're told\\na factory makes toys that are sold for $10 apiece. The factory has 40 workers, and they each produce 25 toys a day. The factory is open five days a week. What is the total value of toys the factory produces in a day? Pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. All right, so let's\\njust think about a day, before I even look at this information. If I could figure out the value per toy, and then multiply that\\ntimes the number of toys, number of toys produced in a day, then we would have the total value. And let's see if they\\ngive us that information. Well the value per toy,\\nthey say the toys are sold for $10 apiece, so we\\ncould write this this way. 10 dollars per toy, and then they do tell us, or they give us the information\\nthat we need to figure out how many are produced in a day. We have 40 workers, and they\\neach produce 25 toys a day. So the amount that's produced in a day, is going to be 40 workers times 25 toys per worker. Now I could say 25 toys\\nper worker per day, and that makes the units\\na little complicated, or I could just realize\\nthat this entire expression I'm creating is talking about one day. So the total number of\\ntoys produced in a day is going to be the\\nproduct of these things. And we can say that the units work out, just to make sure that we're\\ngetting in the right direction. A toy in the denominator cancels out with the toys in the numerator, workers, when you multiply it, this\\nwould be in the numerator, this in the denominator. So workers, workers cancel out. And so I'm gonna be left with\\n10 times 40 times 25 dollars. And I do want it written in dollars. And so this is going to be\\nequal to 10 times 40 is 400, and then 400 times 25, let's\\nsee, that's going to be 4 times 25 times 100 so\\nthat's 100 times 100, which is 10,000, and then the units we're left with is dollars. And now you might be\\nsaying, wait, we didn't use all of the information and\\nthat's true, we didn't use the fact that the factory\\nis open 5 days a week. We didn't need to use that information. That would have been useful if they said, what is the total value of toys the factory produces in a week. Then we would have said their\\nvalue per day is $10,000, and we could even write\\nit this way, per day, and then multiply that\\ntimes 5 days in a week, and that would have\\ngiven us the total value of the production in a week. But that's not what they're asking for, so we don't need that other information, and so we don't have to go to that step. And so this is really\\njust extra information, probably to distract you a bit. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're told that\\nRicky is going on a road trip that is 100 kilometers long. His average speed is\\n70 kilometers per hour. At that speed, he can\\ndrive five kilometers for every liter of fuel that he uses. Fuel costs .60 dollars per liter. So the equivalent of 60 cents per liter, but they wrote it as\\n.60 dollars per liter. What is the cost of fuel for the trip? Pause the video and see if\\nyou can figure that out. All right, so let's see what\\ninformation they gave us. They tell us that the trip\\nis 100 kilometers long. They tell us that the average speed is 70 kilometers per hour. So 70 kilometers per hour. They tell us that at that speed, he can drive five kilometers for every liter of fuel that he uses. So five kilometers per liter. And then they tell us that fuel costs 0.60 dollars per liter. So then this last piece of\\ninformation right over here is that fuel costs 0.60 dollars per liter. Normally we would see that\\nwritten as 60 cents per liter, but let's just go with it this way. So what's going to be\\nuseful for the total cost of the fuel for the trip? Well, we need to figure out how much fuel we're going to use, and then multiply that,\\ntimes the cost of the fuel. So how much fuel are we going to be using? Let's see, we're going 100 kilometers, that's the total distance. And then this tells us,\\nessentially how many liters we're going to have to use\\nover those 100 kilometers. Now you might say, how\\nexactly does that work? Well if I'm going five\\nkilometers per liter, if I were to take the\\nreciprocal of this information, I would get one fifth of a liter, of a liter, per kilometer. That's how much fuel I use per kilometer. One fifth of a liter. And so why is that useful? Well if I take 100 kilometers, and if I were to multiply, times 1/5th of a liter per kilometer, this is going to tell you that over the course of this trip, I am going to use 100 times 1/5th liters. Or this is going to tell us that over the course of the trip, we're are going to use 20 liters. And then if we were to multiply that, times the cost of fuel per liter, well then we know how much\\nthe cost of our trip is. So let's do that. Then let's multiply this, times 0.60 dollars per liter, which is the same thing\\nas multiplying this, times 0.60 dollars per liter. The liters cancel out, so it's good that our units work out. We're left with just dollars here. So 20 times 0.60 is going to get us to 12. So we are left with 12 dollars. And we're done, that's\\nthe cost of our trip. And I know what you're thinking. Wait, we didn't use the\\ninformation right over here, that he's traveling an average speed of 70 kilometers per hour. It's true, we did not use\\nit in our calculation. Although it was kind of\\nuseful because we had to know what his fuel efficiency\\nis, at that speed. So they're saying, they're traveling at 70 kilometers per hour, then at that speed, we\\nget this fuel efficiency. Now they could have just told us, they didn't even have to tell us this, they could have just told us, at whatever speed he's going, his fuel efficiency is this. And we still would have\\nbeen able to figure out the total cost of the fuel for the trip. \"),\n",

So let's do it. And I think it's an interesting\\nunit conversion problem for pretty much anyone who wants\\npractice with unit conversion. So the question is that\\nwe have a doctor. The doctor orders drug x. And this is the dosage that\\nthe doctor's requesting. They're saying 5 milligrams per\\npound of patient weight-- I'll just write per pound of patient\\nweight-- every 12 hours. This is what we're\\nsupposed to do. But our supply of the drug--\\nit isn't just, you know, not just nuggets and milligrams. It's a solution. There's a certain amount of\\ngrams for every milliliter that we have of the solution. It's dissolved in some water. So this is our\\nsupply of drug x. We have 0.9-- I'll\\nwrite a 0 in front. My wife, who is a doctor, says\\nit's essential to write the 0 in front of the decimal. We have 0.9 grams per\\nmilliliter of solution. So if I were to take 1\\nmilliliter out of my solution and give it to someone, I'm\\nessentially giving them 0.9 grams of this drug. And the final piece of\\ninformation we're given is that the patient-- they weigh-- and\\nmaybe we should say they mass, because kilograms is mass,\\nbut we get the idea. The patient is 72.7 kilograms. So there's a couple\\ninteresting things here. We have to figure out the\\ndosage in terms of milliliters. We have to-- oh, actually,\\nI didn't even tell you the question. The question is, how many\\nmilliliters of solution do we have to give to\\nthe patient per dose? So milliliters of\\nsolution per dose. That's our question. And there's a couple of things. We have to go from\\nmilligrams to grams. And then convert that\\nto milliliters. And then they tell us per\\npound, but then they gave us the patient's weight, or\\ntheir mass, in kilograms. So we have to do some\\nconversion there. So I definitely can appreciate\\nhow this can be a little daunting and maybe\\nconfusing at times. So let's just do\\nit step by step. So the first interesting\\nthing-- and this is just something that you might need\\nto know, or you might have written down on paper, or you\\nmight have a calculator that does this-- is just how to\\nconvert kilograms to pounds. And it's good to know in\\ngeneral, if you're converting between the metric and\\nthe English systems. So 1 kilogram is approximately\\nequal to 2.2 pounds. Not exactly, but that's a\\npretty good approximation. And 1 pound-- if you just take\\n1 over that-- 1 pound is approximately equal\\nto 0.45 kilograms. So we'll just put\\nthis in a box. This is the only kind of\\noutside conversion information we'll need to do this problem. Everything else, we'll just\\nneed a calculator, unless we just want to spend a lot of\\ntime doing some arithmetic. So the first thing. Let's figure out our dosage\\nin terms of per kilogram. This is per pound, and\\nwe really don't need to know every 12 hours. Because they're saying, how\\nmany milliliters of solution do we do per dose? A dose is every 12 hours. So we just really, you know--\\nthe every 12 hours is kind of extra information. So we want to figure out this\\n5 milligrams per pound. How do we convert that to how\\nmany milligrams per kilogram? So let's do 5-- I'll write\\nit down here in magenta-- 5 milligrams per pound. And then we want to convert\\nthis to per kilogram. So we can multiply this times\\nthe number of pounds per kilogram-- I'll do it\\nin yellow-- times this information up here. Times 2.2 pounds per kilogram. And if you ever get confused--\\nyou know, gee, how did Sal know to multiply by 2.2 instead\\nof dividing by 2.2? Which is the same thing\\nas multiplying by 0.5. You can pay very close\\nattention to the units. Notice, I wrote 2.2\\npounds per kilogram. 2.2 pounds per 1 kilogram. And you know this'll work out,\\nbecause you have a pound in the numerator and you have\\na pound in the denominator. It's called\\ndimensional analysis. If you ever get confused with\\nthese things-- and I think, once you do enough practice,\\nyou'll find that you won't have to pay too much\\nattention to this. But at first, when you're\\ngetting started, just to make sure you're not multiplying\\nor dividing by the wrong thing, just make sure the\\ndimensions cancel out. Pounds in the numerator,\\npounds in the denominator. So let's do that. Pounds in the numerator, pounds\\nin the denominator cancel out. And you multiply 5 times 2.2. This is equal to-- let's see. 5 times 2 is 10. 5 times 0.2 is 1. So this is equal to 11. And then in our numerator,\\nwe have milligrams. 11 milligrams per kilogram. So we just converted our\\ndosage information to a pure metric system. It was actually a mix\\nbetween the metric and the English system before. Now let's see what we can do. Well, let's see if we can get\\nit in terms of how many milliliters we have to\\ndeliver per pound. So once again, we want this--\\nwell, actually, let's go to grams first. Because we have\\nmilligrams here. We have grams up here. So let's see if we can\\nconvert this thing to grams. So just like we did before,\\nwe want a milligrams in the denominator. I'll do it in orange. We want a milligrams in the\\ndenominator and we want a gram in the numerator. Why did I say that? Because I want this\\nand this to cancel. And I want a grams\\nin the numerator. So how many grams are\\nthere per milligram? You can just think it through. There's 1 gram per\\n1,000 milligrams. Or 1,000 milligrams per gram. And you just multiply it out. So the milligrams cancels with\\nthe milligrams, and then we get-- this is equal to\\n11/1,000 grams per kilogram. So now we have everything in\\nterms of grams, but we want it in terms of milliliters. The question is, how\\nmany milliliters of solution per dose? So let me go down here on\\nthis line right here. So we had this result. We have 11/1,000-- I won't do\\nthe division just yet-- grams of drug x per kilogram. This is really just a re--\\nwe've just rewritten this dosage information\\nin different units. And let's see how much solution\\nwe need per kilogram. So I want to cancel out\\nthe grams here and have a milliliters there. So to cancel out that grams,\\nI'm going to have to have a gram in the denominator and a\\nmilliliter in the numerator. So in our solution, how many\\ngrams are there per milliliter? Well, they told us. There are 0.9 grams\\nper milliliter. Or for every 1 milliliter,\\nthere are 0.9 grams. Notice, I just took\\nthe inverse of that. Because we want a milliliter\\nin the numerator, grams in the denominator, so that\\nthese two cancel out. And let's do this\\nmultiplication now. So our grams cancel out. We have milliliters\\nper kilogram. And then we multiply it out. 11/1,000 times 1 over 0.9. So I'll just keep-- let me\\njust write it like this. So there's going to be 11/1,000\\ntimes 0.9 milliliters of our solution per kilogram. So we've gotten this far. So this is per kilogram\\nof patient body weight. And then finally, they tell\\nus how many kilograms our patient weighs. So let's do that last\\nmultiplication, and then we can actually get our calculator out\\nand do it all at once. So let's multiply this times--\\nwe want to know how many milliliters per patient. We want the kilograms\\nto cancel out. So we want kilograms\\nper patient. Now we're talking about\\nthis particular patient. Not every patient is\\ngoing to be the same number of kilograms. But if we do this,\\nkilograms will cancel out. We'll have milliliters per\\npatient-- milliliters of solution per patient-- which\\nis exactly what we want. We want milliliters of solution\\nper dose per patient. But everything we've assumed\\nso far has been per dose. So how many kilograms\\ndoes the patient weigh? Well, there's 72.7\\nkilograms per patient. That's how much the\\npatient weighs. So we just do this final\\nmultiplication and we'll be done. So our answer-- and as these\\ntwo things are going to cancel out-- so our final answer is\\ngoing to be 11 times 72.7 divided by 100 times--\\nactually, 100 times 0.9 is pretty easy to figure out. That's 900. Divided by 900\\nmilliliters per patient. Or you can just say\\nmilliliters per dose. However you want to say it. Per dose per patient. Let's get our calculator\\nout and do this. So we have 11 times 72.7 is\\nequal to 799 divided by 900. Is equal to 0.88-- well,\\nwe could round up. 0.889. Hopefully the\\ndoctor won't mind. So that is equal to-- I'll\\nwrite it in a nice, vibrant color-- 0.889 milliliters\\nof solution per dose. So this is what we're going\\nto give every 12 hours. If they ask, how many total\\nmilliliters over the course of 2 days? We would have to say,\\noh, there's 48 hours. We'd multiply it by 4. But that 12 hours was extra\\ninformation in this problem. But anyway, hopefully this is\\nuseful, and it'll ensure that any nurses serving me in the\\nfuture are giving me my proper dosage. And hopefully, the doctor even\\ngot the right dosage to begin with, because otherwise\\nit's all for naught. Anyway. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Voiceover] What I\\'d like to\\nintroduce you to in this video is the idea of a Linear Equation. And just to start ourselves out, let\\'s look at some examples\\nof linear equations. So, for example the equation y is equal to two x minus three, this is a linear equation. Now why do we call it a linear equation? Well if you were to take\\nthe set of all of the xy pairs that satisfy this equation and if you were to graph\\nthem on the coordinate plane, you would actually get a line. That\\'s why it\\'s called a linear equation. And let\\'s actually feel\\ngood about that statement. Let\\'s see, let\\'s plot some of the xy pairs that satisfy this equation\\nand then feel good that it does indeed generate a line. So, I\\'m just gonna pick some x values and make it easy to calculate\\nthe corresponding y values. So, if x is equal to zero y is gonna be two times zero minus three which is negative three. And on our coordinate plane here that\\'s-- we\\'re gonna move zero in the x direction, zero in the horizontal direction and we\\'re gonna go down three\\nin the vertical direction, in the y direction. So, that\\'s that point there. If x is equal to one, what is y equal to? Well two times one is two,\\nminus three is negative one. So we move positive one in the x direction and negative one, or down\\none, in the y direction. Now let\\'s see, if x is\\nequal to two what is y? Two times two is four, minus three is one. When x is equal to two y is equal to one. And hopefully you\\'re seeing now that if I were to keep going, and I encourage you though if you want pause the video and try x equals three or x equals negative one and keep going. You will see that this is\\ngoing to generate a line. And in fact, let me connect these dots and you will see the line\\nthat I\\'m talking about. So, let me see if I can draw, I\\'m gonna use the line tool here. Try to connect the dots\\nas neatly as I can. There you go. This line that I have just drawn, this is the graph, this is the graph of y is\\nequal to two x minus three. So if you were to graph all\\nof the xy pairs that satisfy this equation you are gonna get this line. And you might be saying,\\n\"Hey wait wait, hold on Sal, you just tried some particular points, why don\\'t I just get a bunch of points, how do I actually get a line?\" Well, I just tried, over here I just tried\\ninteger values of x. But you can try any value in\\nbetween here, all of these, it\\'s actually a pretty unique concept. Any value of x that you input into this, you find the corresponding value for y, it will sit on this line. So for example, for example, if we were to take x is equal to, actually let\\'s say x is\\nequal to negative point five. So if x is equal to negative point five if we look at the line when x is equal to negative point five it looks like it looks like y is equal to negative four. And that looks like that sits on the line. Well let\\'s verify that. If x is equal to negative, I\\'ll write that as negative one half, then what is y equal to? Let\\'s see, two times negative one half, I\\'ll just write it out, two times negative-- two times negative one half minus three. Well this says two times\\nnegative one half is negative one minus three\\nis indeed negative four it is indeed negative four. So you can literally take any, any-- for any x value that you put here and the corresponding y value it is going to sit on the line. This point right over\\nhere represents a solution to this linear equation. Let me do this in a color you can see. So this point represents a\\nsolution to a linear equation. This point represents a\\nsolution to a linear equation. This point is not a solution\\nto a linear equation. So if ex is equal to five then y is not gonna be equal to three. If x is gonna be equal to\\nfive you go to the line to see what the solution to\\nthe linear equation is. If x is five this shows us\\nthat y is going to be seven. And it\\'s indeed-- that\\'s indeed the case. Two times five is ten,\\nminus three is seven. The point-- the point five comma seven is on, or it satisfies this linear equation. So if you take all of the\\nxy pairs that satisfy it, you get a line. That is why it is called\\na linear equation. Now, this isn\\'t the only\\nway that we could write a linear equation. You could write a linear equation like-- let me do this in a new color. You could write a linear\\nequation like this: Four x minus three y is equal to twelve. This also is a linear equation. And we can see that if we\\nwere to graph the xy pairs that satisfy this we would\\nonce again get a line. X and y. If x is equal to zero, then this goes away and you have negative three\\ny is equal to twelve. Let\\'s see, if negative\\nthree y equals twelve then y would be equal to negative four. Nega-- zero comma negative four. You can verify that. Four times zero minus\\nthree times negative four well that\\'s gonna be\\nequal to positive twelve. And let\\'s see, if y were to equal zero, if y were to equal zero then this is gonna be four\\ntimes x is equal to twelve, well then x is equal to three. And so you have the point\\nzero comma negative four, zero comma negative four on this line, and you have the point three\\ncomma zero on this line. Three comma zero. Did I do that right? Yep. So zero comma negative four\\nand then three comma zero. These are going to be on this line. Three comma zero is also on this line. So this is, this line is\\ngoing to look something like-- something like, I\\'ll\\njust try to hand draw it. Something like that. So once again, all of the xy-- all of the xy pairs that satisfy this, if you were to plot them\\nout it forms a line. Now what are some examples,\\nmaybe you\\'re saying \"Wait, wait, wait, isn\\'t any\\nequation a linear equation?\" And the simple answer is\\n\"No, not any equation is a linear equation.\" I\\'ll give you some examples\\nof non-linear equations. So a non-- non-linear, whoops let me write a\\nlittle bit neater than that. Non-linear equations. Well, those could include something like y is equal to x-squared. If you graph this you will see that this\\nis going to be a curve. it could be something like x\\ntimes y is equal to twelve. This is also not going to be a line. Or it could be something\\nlike five over x plus y is equal to ten. This also is not going to be a line. So now, and at some point you could-- I encourage you to try\\nto graph these things, they\\'re actually quite interesting. But given that we\\'ve now seen\\nexamples of linear equations and non-linear equations, let\\'s see if we can come\\nup with a definition for linear equations. One way to think about is it\\'s an equation that if you were to graph\\nall of the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation, you\\'ll get a line. And that\\'s actually\\nliterally where the word linear equation comes from. But another way to think about it is it\\'s going to be an equation where every term is either\\ngoing to be a constant, so for example, twelve is a constant. It\\'s not going to change\\nbased on the value of some variable, twelve is twelve. Or negative three is negative three. So every term is either\\ngoing to be a constant or it\\'s going to be a\\nconstant times a variable raised to the first power. So this is the constant two\\ntimes x to the first power. This is the variable y\\nraised to the first power. You could say that bceause\\nthis is just one y. We\\'re not dividing by x or y, we\\'re not multiplying, we don\\'t have a term that\\nhas x to the second power, or x to the third power,\\nor y to the fifth power. We just have y to the first power, we have x to the first power. We\\'re not multiplying x and y together like we did over here. So if every-- if every term in your equation, on either side of the equation, is either a constant or its\\njust some number times x, just x to the first power\\nor some number times y, and you\\'re not multiplying\\nyour x\\'s and y\\'s together you are dealing with a linear equation.

What we have to remind ourselves is when we\\'re give an ordered pair, the first number is the x\\ncoordinate and the second number is the y coordinate, or the y value. So when they tell us the ordered pair, negative four comma four, they\\'re saying \"hey look, if x is equal to \"negative four, and y is\\nequal to positive four, \"does that satisfy this equation?\" And what we can do, is\\nwe can just try that out. So we have negative three\\nand everywhere we see an x, everywhere we see an x, we can replace it with negative four. So it\\'s negative three\\ntimes negative four, minus, minus and everywhere we see a y, we can replace it with positive four. We replace it with positive four. So negative three times x minus y, which is four, needs to be equal to six. Needs to be equal to six. Now is this indeed the case? Negative three times negative four is positive 12. Positive 12 minus four,\\npositive 12 minus four is equal to eight, it\\'s not equal to six. Is not equal, is not equal to six. So this one does not work out. So let\\'s see, negative three comma three. We can do the same thing here. Let\\'s see what happens when\\nx is equal to negative three and y is equal to positive three. So we substitute back in,\\nwe get negative three. Negative three times x,\\nwhich now we\\'re going to try out x being equal to negative three. Minus y, minus y. Y is positive three here. Minus y, gonna do that y color blue. Minus y now needs to be equal to, now needs to be equal, just like before needs to be equal to six. So negative three times negative three. That\\'s going to be positive nine. Nine minus three is indeed equal to six. Nine minus three is\\nindeed equal to six. Nine minus three is six. That is equal to six. This works out.

Now, when we look at an\\nordered pair we wanna figure out whether it\\'s a\\nsolution, we just have to remind ourselves that\\nin these ordered pairs the convention, the standard,\\nis is that the first coordinate is the x coordinate,\\nand the second coordinate is the y coordinate. So they\\'re gonna, if this is\\na solution, if this ordered pair is a solution, that means\\nthat if x is equal to three and y is equal to two,\\nthat that would satisfy this equation up here. So let\\'s try that out. So, we have four times x. Well we\\'re saying x needs\\nto be equal to three, minus one, is going to be\\nequal to three times y. Well, if this ordered\\npair is a solution then y is going to be equal\\nto two, so three times y, y is two, plus five. Notice all I did is wherever I saw the x, I substituted it with three, wherever I saw the y, I\\nsubstituted it with two. Now let\\'s see if this is true. Four times three is twelve, minus one. Is this really the same\\nthing as three times two which is six, plus five? See, 12 minus one is 11, six plus five is also 11. This is true, 11 equals 11. This pair three, two does\\nsatisfy this equation. Now let\\'s see whether\\nthis one does, two, three. So this is saying when x is equal to two, y would be equal to\\nthree for this equation. Let\\'s see if that\\'s true. So four times x, we\\'re\\nnow gonna see if when x is two, y can be three. So four times x, four times two, minus one is equal to three times y, now y we\\'re testing to\\nsee if it can be three. Three times three plus five, let\\'s see if this is true. Four times two is eight, minus one, is this equal to three times three? So that\\'s nine plus five. So is seven equal to 14? No, clearly seven is not equal to 14. So these things are not\\nequal to each other. So this is not a solution,\\nwhen x equals two y cannot be to three and\\nsatisfy this equation. So only three, two is a solution. '),\n",

       "  '- [Voiceover] So this is an example from the Khan Academy exercise,\\ngraphing solutions to two variable linear equations. And they tell us to complete the table so each row represents a solution of the following equation. And they give us the equation, and then they want us to figure out, what does y equal when x is equal to negative five? And what does x equal when y is equal to eight. And to figure this out, I\\'ve actually copied and pasted this part of the problem onto my scratchpad, so let me get that out. And so this is the exact same problem, there\\'s a couple of ways that we could try to tackle it. One way, is you could try\\nto simplify this more, get all your xs on one side and all your ys on the other side. Or we could just literally substitute when x equals negative five, what must y equal? Actually, let me do it\\nthe second way, first. So if we take this equation, and we substitute x with negative five, what do we get? We get negative three times, well, we\\'re gonna say x is negative five, times negative five, plus seven y is equal to five times, x is once again, it\\'s gonna be negative five, x is negative five, five times negative five, plus two y. See, negative three times negative five is positive 15, plus seven y, is equal to negative 25 plus two y. And now, to solve for y, let\\'s see, I could subtract\\ntwo y from both sides, so that I get rid of the\\ntwo y here on the right. So let me subtract two y, subtract two y from both sides. And then if I want all my\\nconstants on the right hand side, I can subtract 15 from both sides. So let me subtract 15 from both sides. And I\\'m going to be left with\\n15 minus 15, that\\'s zero, that\\'s the whole point of subtracting 15 from both sides, so I\\nget rid of this 15 here. Seven y minus two y. Seven of something minus\\ntwo of that same something is gonna be five of that something. It\\'s gonna be equal to five y, is equal to negative 25 minus 15. Well, that\\'s gonna be negative 40. And then two y minus two y,\\nwell, that\\'s just gonna be zero. That was the whole point of subtracting two y from both sides. So you have five times y\\nis equal to negative 40. Or, if we divide both sides by five, we divide both sides by five, we would get y is equal to negative eight. So when x is equal to negative five, y is equal to negative eight. Y is equal to negative eight. And actually we can fill that in. So this y is going to be\\nequal to negative eight. And now we gotta figure this out. What does x equal when\\ny is positive eight? Well, we can go back\\nto our scratchpad here. And I\\'ll take the same equation, but let\\'s make y equal to positive eight. So you have negative three x plus seven, now y is going to be eight, y is eight, seven times eight is\\nequal to five times x, plus two times, once again, y is eight, two times eight. So we get negative three x plus 56, that\\'s 56, is equal to five x plus 16. Now, if we wanna get all of our constants on one side, and of all of our x\\nterms on the other side, well, what could we do? Let\\'s see, we could add\\nthree x to both sides. That would get rid of\\nall the xs on this side, and put \\'em all on this side. So we\\'re gonna add three x to both sides. And, let\\'s see, if we want to get all the\\nconstants on the left hand side, we\\'d wanna get rid of the 16, so we could subtract 16\\nfrom the right hand side, if we do it from the right, we\\'re gonna have to do\\nit from the left as well. And we\\'re gonna be left\\nwith, these cancel out, 56 minus 16 is positive 40. And then, let\\'s see, 16 minus 16 is zero. Five x plus three x is equal to eight x. We get eight x is equal to 40. We could divide both sides by eight, and we get, five is equal to x. So this right over here is going to be equal to five. So let\\'s go back, let\\'s go back, now. So when y is positive eight, x is positive five. Now they ask us, \"Use your two solutions \"to graph the equation.\" So let\\'s see if we can do, oh, whoops, let me, let\\nme use my mouse now. So to graph the equations. So when x is negative\\nfive, y is negative eight. So the point negative\\nfive comma negative eight. So that\\'s right over there. So let me move my browser\\nup so you can see that. Negative five, when x is negative five, y is negative eight. And when x is positive five, and we see that up here, when x is positive five,\\ny is positive eight. When x is positive five,\\ny is positive eight. And we\\'re done. We can check our answer, if we like. We got it right. Now, I said there was\\ntwo ways to tackle it, I kind of just did it, I guess\\nyou could say, the naive way. I just substituted negative five directly into this and solved for y. And then I substituted\\ny equals positive eight directly into this, and then solved for x. Another way that I could have done it, that actually probably would have been, or, it would for sure, would have been the easier way to do it, is ahead of time to try to\\nsimplify this expression. So what I could have done,\\nright from the get-go, is said, \"Hey, let\\'s put\\nall my xs on one side, \"and all my ys on the other side.\" So this is negative three x plus seven y is equal to five x plus two y. Now let\\'s say I wanna\\nget all my ys on the left and all my xs on the right. So I don\\'t want this\\nnegative three x on the left, so I\\'d wanna add three x. Adding three x would cancel this out, but I can\\'t just do it\\non the left hand side, I have to do it on the\\nright hand side as well. And then, if I wanna get rid\\nof this two y on the right, I could subtract two y from the right, but, of course, I\\'d also\\nwanna do it from the left. And then what am I left with? So negative three x plus three x is zero, seven y minus two y is five y. And then I have five x plus three x is eight x. Two y minus two y is zero. And then if I wanted\\nto, I could solve for y, I could divide both sides by five and I\\'d get y is equal to 8/5 x. So, this right over here represents the same exact equation as this over here, it\\'s just written in a different way. All of the xy pairs that satisfy this, would satisfy this, and vice versa. And this is much easier. Because if x is now negative five, if x is negative five, y would be 8/5 times negative five, well, that\\'s going to be negative eight. And when y is equal to eight, well, you actually could\\neven do this up here, you could say five times\\neight is equal to eight x, and then you could see, well five times eight the same\\nthing as eight times five, so x would be equal to five. So I think this would actually have been a simpler way to do it. You see it all, I was able\\nto do the entire problem in this little white space here, instead of having to do all of this, slightly, slightly hairier, algebra. '),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] As we start to graph lines, we might notice that they're\\ndifferences between lines. For example, this pink or\\nthis magenta line here, it looks steeper than this blue line. And what we'll see is\\nthis notion of steepness, how steep a line is, how\\nquickly does it increase or how quickly does it decrease, is a really useful idea in mathematics. So ideally, we'd be\\nable to assign a number to each of these lines\\nor to any lines that describes how steep it is, how quickly does it increase or decrease? So what's a reasonable way to do that? What's a reasonable way to assign a number to these lines that\\ndescribe their steepness? Well one way to think\\nabout it, could say well, how much does a line increase in the vertical direction for a given increase in\\nthe horizontal direction? So let's write this down. So let's say if we an increase increase, in vertical, in vertical, for a given increase in horizontal for a given increase a given increase in horizontal. So, how can this give us a value? Well let's look at that\\nmagenta line again. Now let's just start at an arbituary point in that magenta line. But I'll start at a point where it's going to be easy for me to figure out what point we're at. So if we were to start right here, and if I were to increase\\nin the horizontal direction by one. So I move one to the right. To get back on the line, how much do I have to increase in\\nthe vertical direction? Well I have to increase in\\nthe vertical direction by two. By two. So at least for this magenta line, it looks like our increase in vertical is two, whenever we have an increase in one in the horizontal direction. Let's see, does that\\nstill work if I were to start here, instead of\\nincreasing the horizontal direction by one, if I were increase in the horizontal direction... So let's increase by three. So now, I've gone plus three in the horizontal direction, then to get back on the line, how much do I have to increase\\nin the vertical direction? I have to increase by one,\\ntwo, three, four, five, six I have to increase by six. So plus six. So when I increase by three in the horizontal direction, I increase by six in the vertical. We were just saying,\\nhey, let's just measure how much to we increase in vertical for a given increase in the horizontal? Well two over one is just two and that's the same\\nthing as six over three. So no matter where I start on this line, no matter where I start on this line, if I take and if I increase\\nin the horizontal direction by a given amount, I'm going to increase twice as much twice as much in the vertical direction. Twice as much in the vertical direction. So this notion of this\\nincrease in vertical divided by increase in horizontal, this is what mathematicians\\nuse to describe the steepness of lines. And this is called the slope. So this is called the slope of a line. And you're probably\\nfamiliar with the notion of the word slope being\\nused for a ski slope, and that's because a ski slope\\nhas a certain inclination. It could have a steep\\nslope or a shallow slope. So slope is a measure for\\nhow steep something is. And the convention is, is\\nwe measure the increase in vertical for a given\\nin increase in horizontal. So six two over one is\\nequal to six over three is equal to two, this\\nis equal to the slope of this magenta line. So let me write this down. So this slope right over\\nhere, the slope of that line, is going to be equal to two. And one way to interpret that, for whatever amount you increase in the horizontal direction,\\nyou're going to increase twice as much in the vertical direction. Now what about this blue line here? What would be the slope of the blue line? Well, let me rewrite another\\nway that you'll typically see the definition of slope. And this is just the\\nconvention that mathematicians have defined for slope but it's a valuable one. What is are is our change in vertical for a given change in horizontal? And I'll introduce a new notation for you. So, change in vertical, and in this coordinate, the vertical is our Y coordinate. divided by our change in horizontal. And X is our horizontal coordinate in this coordinate plane right over here. So wait, you said change in but then you drew this triangle. Well this is the Greek letter delta. This is the Greek letter delta. And it's a math symbol used\\nto represent change in. So that's delta, delta. And it literally means, change in Y, change in Y, divided by change in X, change in X. So if we want to find the\\nslope of the blue line, we just have to say, well\\nhow much does Y change for a given change in X? So, the slope of the blue line. So let's see, let me do it this way. Let's just start at some point here. And let's say my X changes by two so my delta X is equal to positive two. What's my delta Y going to be? What's going to be my change in Y? Well, if I go by the right by two, to get back on the line, I'll have to increase my Y by two. So my change in Y is also\\ngoing to be plus two. So the slope of this blue line, the slope of the blue line, which is change in Y over change in X. We just saw that when our\\nchange in X is positive two, our change in Y is also positive two. So our slope is two divided by two, which is equal to one. Which tells us however much we increase in X, we're going to increase\\nthe same amount in Y. We see that, we increase\\none in X, we increase one in Y. Increase one in X, increase one in Y. >From any point on the line,\\nthat's going to be true. You increase three in X, you're going to increase three in Y. It's actually true the other way. If you decrease one in X, you're going to decrease one in Y. If you decrease two in X, you're going to decrease two in Y. And that makes sense from\\nthe math of it as well Because if you're change\\nin X is negative two, that's what we did right over here, our change is X is negative two, we went two back, then your change in Y is going\\nto be negative two as well. Your change in Y is\\ngoing to be negative two, and negative two divided by negative two, is positive one, which\\nis your slope again. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Slope is\\ndefined as your change in the vertical direction, and I could use the Greek letter delta,\\nthis little triangle here is the Greek letter\\ndelta, it means change in. Change in the vertical\\ndirection divided by change in the horizontal direction. That is the standard definition of slope and it's a reasonable way for measuring how steep something is. So for example, if we're\\nlooking at the xy plane here, our change in the vertical direction is gonna be a change in the y variable divided by change in horizontal direction, is gonna be a change in the x variable. So let's see why that is a\\ngood definition for slope. Well I could draw something\\nwith a slope of one. A slope of one might\\nlook something like... so a slope of one, as x increases by one, y increases by one, so a slope of one... is going to look like this. Notice, however much my change in x is, so for example here, my\\nchange in x is positive two, I'm gonna have the same change in y. My change in y is going to be plus two. So my change in y divided by change in x is two divided by two is one. So for this line I have\\nslope is equal to one. But what would a slope of two look like? Well, a slope of two should be\\nsteeper and we can draw that. Let me start at a different point, so if I start over here a\\nslope of two would look like... for every one that I\\nincrease in the x direction I'm gonna increase two in the y direction, so it's going to look like... that. This line right over here, you see it. If my change in x is equal to one, my change in y is two. So change in y over\\nchange in x is gonna be two over one, the slope here is two. And now, hopefully, you're appreciating why this definition of\\nslope is a good one. The higher the slope, the\\nsteeper it is, the faster it increases, the faster\\nwe increase in the vertical direction as we increase in\\nthe horizontal direction. Now what would a negative slope be? So let's just think about what a line with a negative slope would mean. A negative slope would mean,\\nwell we could take an example. If we have our change\\nin y over change in x was equal to a negative one. That means that if we\\nhave a change in x of one, then in order to get\\nnegative one here, that means that our change in y would have\\nto be equal to negative one. So a line with a negative\\none slope would look like... would look like this. Notice, as x increases\\nby a certain amount, so our delta x here is one, y decreases by that same\\namount instead of increasing. So now this is what we consider\\na downward sloping line. So change in y is equal to negative one. So our change in y over our change in x is equal to negative one over one which is equal to negative one. So the slope of this line is negative one. Now if you had a slope with negative two, it would decrease even faster. So a line with a slope of negative two could look something like this. So as x increases by one,\\ny would decrease by two. So it would look something like... it would look like that. Notice, as our x increases\\nby a certain amount, our y decreases by twice as much. So this right over here has a slope of negative two. So hopefully this gives you a little bit more intuition for what slope represents and how the number that\\nwe use to represent slope, how you can use that to\\nvisualize how steep a line is. A very high positive\\nslope, as x increases, y is going to increase\\nfairly dramatically. If you have a negative slope... as x increases, your y is\\nactually going to decrease. And then the higher\\nthe slope, the steeper, the more you increase as x increases, and the more negative the slope, the more you decrease as x increases. \"),\n",

       "  \"Find the slope of the\\nline in the graph. And just as a bit of a review,\\nslope is just telling us how steep a line is. And the best way to view it,\\nslope is equal to change in y over change in x. And for a line, this will\\nalways be constant. And sometimes you might see it\\nwritten like this: you might see this triangle, that's a\\ncapital delta, that means change in, change in\\ny over change in x. That's just a fancy way\\nof saying change in y over change in x. So let's see what this change\\nin y is for any change in x. So let's start at some point\\nthat seems pretty reasonable to read from this table right\\nhere, from this graph. So let's see, we're starting\\nhere-- let me do it in a more vibrant color-- so let's\\nsay we start at that point right there. And we want to go to another\\npoint that's pretty straightforward to read,\\nso we can move to that point right there. We could literally pick any\\ntwo points on this line. I'm just picking ones that are\\nnice integer coordinates, so it's easy to read. So what is the change in y and\\nwhat is the change in x? So first let's look at\\nthe change in x. So if we go from there\\nto there, what is the change in x? My change in x is\\nequal to what? Well, I can just count it out. I went 1 steps, 2\\nsteps, 3 steps. My change in x is 3. And you could even see\\nit from the x values. If I go from negative 3\\nto 0, I went up by 3. So my change in x is 3. So let me write this, change in\\nx, delta x is equal to 3. And what's my change in y? Well, my change in y, I'm going\\nfrom negative 3 up to negative 1, or you could\\njust say 1, 2. So my change in y, is\\nequal to positive 2. So let me write that down. Change in y is equal to 2. So what is my change in\\ny for a change in x? Well, when my change in x was\\n3, my change in y is 2. So this is my slope. And one thing I want to do, I\\nwant to show you that I could have really picked any\\ntwo points here. Let's say I didn't pick-- let me\\nclear this out-- let's say I didn't pick those two points,\\nlet me pick some other points, and I'll even go in\\na different direction. I want to show you that you're\\ngoing to get the same answer. Let's say I've used this as my\\nstarting point, and I want to go all the way over there. Well, let's think about the\\nchange in y first. So the change in y, I'm going down\\nby how many units? 1, 2, 3, 4 units, so my change\\nin y, in this example, is negative 4. I went from 1 to negative\\n3, that's negative 4. That's my change in y. Change in y is equal\\nto negative 4. Now what is my change in x? Well I'm going from this point,\\nor from this x value, all the way-- let me do that in\\na different color-- all the way back like this. So I'm going to the left, so\\nit's going to be a negative change in x, and I went 1,\\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6 units back. So my change in x is equal\\nto negative 6. And you can even see I started\\nit at x is equal to 3, and I went all the way to x is\\nequal to negative 3. That's a change of negative 6. I went 6 to the left, or\\na change of negative 6. So what is my change in\\ny over change in x? My change in y over change in x\\nis equal to negative 4 over negative 6. The negatives cancel out\\nand what's 4 over 6? Well, that's just 2 over 3. So it's the same value, you just\\nhave to be consistent. If this is my start point,\\nI went down 4, and then I went back 6. Negative 4 over negative 6. If I viewed this as my starting\\npoint, I could say that I went up 4, so it would\\nbe a change in y would be 4, and then my change\\nin x would be 6. And either way, once again,\\nchange in y over change in x is going to be 4 over 6, 2/3. So no matter which point you\\nchoose, as long as you kind of think about it in a consistent\\nway, you're going to get the same value for slope. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We are asked, what is the slope of the line\\nthat contains these points? So pause this video and see\\nif you can work through this on your own before we do it together. Alright, now let's do it together, and let's just remind\\nourselves what slope is. Slope is equal to change in y, this is the Greek letter delta, look likes a triangle, but it's shorthand for change in y over change in x. Sometimes you would see\\nit written as y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 where you could kind of view\\nx1 y1 as the starting point and x2 y2 as the ending point. So let's just pick two xy pairs here, and we can actually pick any two if we can assume that this is\\nactually describing a line. So we might as well\\njust pick the first two. So let's say that's our starting point and that's our finishing point. So what is our change in x here? So we're going from two to three, so our change in x is\\nequal to three minus two which is equal to one, and you can see that\\nto go from two to three you're just adding one. And what's our change in y? Our change in y is our finishing y one minus our starting y four, which\\nis equal to negative three. And you could of, you didn't\\neven have to do this math, you would have been able to see to go from two to three you added one, and to go from four to one,\\nyou have to subtract three. For there we have all\\nthe information we need. What is change in y over change in x? Well, it's going to be, our change in y is negative three and our change in x is one. So our slope is negative\\nthree divided by one is negative three. Let's do another example. Here we are asked, what is the slope of the line that contains these points? So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure it out or pause the video again and\\nsee if you can figure it out. Alright, so remember, slope\\nis equal to change in y over change in x. And we should be able to\\npick any two of these pairs in order to figure that out if we assume that this is indeed a line. Well, just for variety, let's\\npick these middle two pairs. So what's our change in x? To go from one to five, we added four. And what's our change in y? To go from seven to 13, we added six. So our change in y is six\\nwhen our change in x is four. And I got the signs right,\\nin both case it's a positive. When x increases, y increased as well. So our slope is six fourths, and we could rewrite that if we like. Both six and four are divisible by two, so let be divide both the\\nnumerator and the denominator by two and we get three\\nhalves, and we're done. \"),\n",

       "  'Find the slope of\\nthe line that goes through the ordered pairs\\n4 comma 2 and negative 3 comma 16. So just as a reminder, slope\\nis defined as rise over run. Or, you could view that rise\\nis just change in y and run is just change in x. The triangles here,\\nthat\\'s the delta symbol. It literally means \"change in.\" Or another way, and you\\nmight see this formula, and it tends to be\\nreally complicated. But just remember it\\'s just\\nthese two things over here. Sometimes, slope will be\\nspecified with the variable m. And they\\'ll say that\\nm is the same thing-- and this is really the\\nsame thing as change in y. They\\'ll write y2 minus\\ny1 over x2 minus x1. And this notation tends\\nto be kind of complicated, but all this means\\nis, is you take the y-value of your endpoint\\nand subtract from it the y-value of your\\nstarting point. That will essentially\\ngive you your change in y. And it says take the\\nx-value of your endpoint and subtract from that the\\nx-value of your starting point. And that\\'ll give\\nyou change in x. So whatever of\\nthese work for you, let\\'s actually figure out\\nthe slope of the line that goes through these two points. So we\\'re starting\\nat-- and actually, we could do it both ways. We could start at this\\npoint and go to that point and calculate the slope or\\nwe could start at this point and go to that point\\nand calculate the slope. So let\\'s do it both ways. So let\\'s say that our starting\\npoint is the point 4 comma 2. And let\\'s say that our endpoint\\nis negative 3 comma 16. So what is the change\\nin x over here? What is the change in\\nx in this scenario? So we\\'re going from\\n4 to negative 3. If something goes\\nfrom 4 to negative 3, what was it\\'s change? You have to go\\ndown 4 to get to 0, and then you have to go down\\nanother 3 to get to negative 3. So our change in x\\nhere is negative 7. Actually, let me\\nwrite it this way. Our change in x is equal\\nto negative 3 minus 4, which is equal to negative 7. If I\\'m going from 4 to\\nnegative 3, I went down by 7. Our change in x is negative 7. Let\\'s do the same thing\\nfor the change in y. And notice, I implicitly\\nuse this formula over here. Our change in x was this value,\\nour endpoint, our end x-value minus our starting x-value. Let\\'s do the same thing\\nfor our change in y. Our change in y. If we\\'re starting at\\n2 and we go to 16, that means we moved up 14. Or another way you\\ncould say it, you could take your ending\\ny-value and subtract from that your starting y-value\\nand you get 14. So what is the slope over here? Well, the slope is just\\nchange in y over change in x. So the slope over\\nhere is change in y over change in x, which\\nis-- our change in y is 14. And our change in\\nx is negative 7. And then if we want to simplify\\nthis, 14 divided by negative 7 is negative 2. Now, what I want\\nto show you is, is that we could have done\\nit the other way around. We could have made\\nthis the starting point and this the endpoint. And what we would have\\ngotten is the negative values of each of these, but then\\nthey would\\'ve canceled out and we would still\\nget negative 2. Let\\'s try it out. So let\\'s say that our start\\npoint was negative 3 comma 16. And let\\'s say that our\\nendpoint is the 4 comma 2. 4 comma 2. So in this situation,\\nwhat is our change in x? Our change in x. If I start at negative\\n3 and I go to 4, that means I went up 7. Or if you want to\\njust calculate that, you would do 4 minus negative 3. 4 minus negative 3. But needless to say,\\nwe just went up 7. And what is our change in y? Our change in y over here,\\nor we could say our rise. If we start at 16 and we end at\\n2, that means we went down 14. Or you could just say 2\\nminus 16 is negative 14. We went down by 14. This was our run. So if you say rise\\nover run, which is the same thing as change\\nin y over change in x, our rise is negative 14\\nand our run here is 7. So notice, these are\\njust the negatives of these values from\\nwhen we swapped them. So once again, this is\\nequal to negative 2. And let\\'s just visualize this. Let me do a quick\\ngraph here just to show you what a downward\\nslope would look like. So let me draw our two points. So this is my x-axis. That is my y-axis. So this point over\\nhere, 4 comma 2. So let me graph it. So we\\'re going to go\\nall the way up to 16. So let me save some space here. So we have 1, 2, 3, 4. It\\'s 4 comma-- 1, 2. So 4 comma 2 is right over here. 4 comma 2. Then we have the point\\nnegative 3 comma 16. So let me draw that over here. So we have negative 1, 2, 3. And we have to go up 16. So this is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\\n9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So it goes right over here. So this is negative 3 comma 16. Negative 3 comma 16. So the line that\\ngoes between them is going to look\\nsomething like this. Try my best to draw a\\nrelatively straight line. That line will keep going. So the line will keep going. So that\\'s my best attempt. And now notice, it\\'s\\ndownward sloping. As you increase an x-value,\\nthe line goes down. It\\'s going from the top\\nleft to the bottom right. As x gets bigger,\\ny gets smaller. That\\'s what a downward-sloping\\nline looks like. And just to visualize our\\nchange in x\\'s and our change in y\\'s that we dealt with\\nhere, when we started at 4 and we ended at-- or when\\nwe started at 4 comma 2 and ended at\\nnegative 3 comma 16, that was analogous to starting\\nhere and ending over there. And we said our change\\nin x was negative 7. We had to move back. Our run we had to move in\\nthe left direction by 7. That\\'s why it was a negative 7. And then we had to move\\nin the y-direction. We had to move in the\\ny-direction positive 14. So that\\'s why our\\nrise was positive. So it\\'s 14 over negative\\n7, or negative 2. When we did it the other way,\\nwe started at this point. We started at this point,\\nand then ended at this point. Started at negative 3, 16\\nand ended at that point. So in that situation,\\nour run was positive 7. And now we have to go\\ndown in the y-direction since we switched the\\nstarting and the endpoint. And now we had to\\ngo down negative 14. Our run is now positive 7 and\\nour rise is now negative 14. Either way, we got\\nthe same slope. '),\n",

I'm going from-- you\\ncould either view this as the starting\\npoint or view this as the starting point. But let's view this\\nas the starting point. So this negative 3, 1. If I go from negative 3,\\nnegative 1 to 7, negative 1, I'm running a good bit. I'm going from negative 3. My x value is negative 3 here,\\nand it goes all the way to 7. So my change in x here is 10.

How much did we change in y? Well, we didn't rise at all. We didn't go up or down. So the slope here is 0. Or another way to think about\\nis this line has no inclination. It's a completely flat-- it's\\na completely horizontal line. So this should make sense. This is a 0. The slope here is 0. And just to make\\nsure that this gels with all of these other\\nformulas that you might know-- but I want to make\\nit very clear. These are all just\\ntelling you rise over run or change in y over change in\\nx, a way to measure inclination. But let's just\\napply them just so, hopefully, it all\\nmakes sense to you. So we could also say slope is\\nchange in y over change in x. If we take this to be\\nour start and if we take this to be our\\nend point, then we would call this over here x1. And then this is over here. This is y1. And then we would\\ncall this x2 and we would call this y2, if\\nthis is our start point and that is our end point. And so the slope here, the\\nchange in y, y2 minus y1. So it's negative 1\\nminus negative 1, all of that over x2, negative\\n3, minus x1, minus 7. So the numerator, negative\\n1 minus negative 1, that's the same thing\\nas negative 1 plus 1. And our denominator\\nis negative 3 minus 7, which is negative 10. So once again, negative 1\\nplus 1 is 0 over negative 10. And this is still going to be 0. And the only reason why\\nwe got a negative 10 here and a positive 10\\nthere is because we swapped the starting\\nand the ending point. In this example right over here,\\nwe took this as the start point and made this coordinate\\nover here as the end point.

These are all just\\ntelling you rise over run or change in y over change in\\nx, a way to measure inclination. But let's just\\napply them just so, hopefully, it all\\nmakes sense to you. So we could also say slope is\\nchange in y over change in x. If we take this to be\\nour start and if we take this to be our\\nend point, then we would call this over here x1. And then this is over here. This is y1. And then we would\\ncall this x2 and we would call this y2, if\\nthis is our start point and that is our end point. And so the slope here, the\\nchange in y, y2 minus y1. So it's negative 1\\nminus negative 1, all of that over x2, negative\\n3, minus x1, minus 7. So the numerator, negative\\n1 minus negative 1, that's the same thing\\nas negative 1 plus 1. And our denominator\\nis negative 3 minus 7, which is negative 10. So once again, negative 1\\nplus 1 is 0 over negative 10. And this is still going to be 0. And the only reason why\\nwe got a negative 10 here and a positive 10\\nthere is because we swapped the starting\\nand the ending point. In this example right over here,\\nwe took this as the start point and made this coordinate\\nover here as the end point. Over here, we\\nswapped them around. 7, negative 1 was\\nour start point, and negative 3, negative\\n1 is our end point. So if we start over\\nhere, our change in x is going to be negative 10. But our change in y is\\nstill going to be 0. So regardless of how you do it,\\nthe slope of this line is 0. It's a horizontal line. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Let's say that\\nwe have the linear equation, y = 1/2x - 3. So if we wanted to draw\\nthe line that represents the set of all points, all the\\ncoordinates where the x value and the y value satisfy this equation, we could start off by just trying to draw, by trying to draw a few of those points, and then connecting them with a line. Let's set up a little table here x, y. And we can just try a\\ncouple of x values here, then figure out what the\\ncorresponding y values are. I'm going to pick x\\nvalues where it's going to be fairly easy to\\ncalculate the y values. Let's say when x is equal to zero, then you're gonna have 1/2 x 0 - 3, well then y is going to be -3. When x is, let me try x\\n= 2, because then 1/2 x 2 is just gonna be 1. So when x = 2, you're going to have 1/2 x 2 = 1, -3 is -2. When x is equal to, let's try 4. So 1/2 x 4 is 2, and then -3 is -1, and we could keep going but actually all we need is two points for a line. So we're ready to plot\\nthis line if we'd like. The point 0, -3 is on this line. 0, -3 and actually let me do\\nthis in a slightly darker color so that we can see it on\\nthis white background. 0, -3 is on the line,\\n2, -2 is on the line. So 2, -2 and then we have 4, -1. So when x is 4, y is -1, and I could draw a line\\nthat connects all of these so it would look something like... If I, let's see if I could do this. It would look something like, it would something like, like that. So this right over\\nhere, this is literally, this is the graph of y = 1/2x - 3. Now when we look at a graph like this an interesting thing that\\nwe might want to ask ourself is where does the graph\\nintersect our axes? So first we can say, well where does in intersect our x-axis? When you look at this, it looks like it happens at this point right over here. This point where a\\ngraph intersects an axes this is called an intercept. This one in particular is\\ncalled the x-intercept. Why is it called the x-intercept? Because that's where the graph is intersecting the x-axis and the x-intercept, it looks like this is at the .6, 0. Now it's very interesting, the x-intercept happens when y = 0. Remember, you're on the x-axis when you haven't moved up\\nor down from that axis which means y = 0. So your x-intercept\\nhappens at x = 6, y = 0. It's this coordinate. Now what about the y-intercept? Well the y-intercept is\\nthis point right over here. This is where you intersect or I guess you could say intercept the y-axis. So this right over here, that over there is the y-intercept. The y-intercept is at the coordinate that has a 0 for the x-coordinate. X is 0 here and y is -3. X is 0 and y is -3. This was actually one of the points, or one of the pairs\\nthat we first tried out. You can validate that 6,\\n0 satisfies this equation right over here. If x is 6, 1/2 x 6 is 3,\\n-3 is indeed equal to 0. So now that we know\\nwhat an x-intercept is, it's the point where a\\ngraph intersects the x-axis or intercepts the x-axis\\nand the y-intercept is the point where a graph\\nintercepts the y-axis or intersects the y-axis. Let's try to see if we can\\nfind the x and y-intercepts for a few other linear equations. So let's say that I had\\nthe linear equation. Let's say that I have 5x + 6y = 30. I encourage you to pause this video, and figure out what are\\nthe x and y-intercepts for the graph that\\nrepresents the solutions, all the xy pairs that\\nsatisfy this equation. Well the easiest thing to do here, let's see what the y value is when x = 0 and what x value is when y = 0. When x = 0 this becomes 6y = 30. So 6 times what is 30? Well y would be equal to 5 here. So when x is 0, y is 5. What about when y is 0? Well when y is 0, that's going to be 0, and you have 5x = 30. Well then x would be equal to 6. Then x would be equal to 6. So we could plot those points, 0, 5. When x is 0, y is 5. When x is 6, y is 0. So those are both points on this graph and then the actual graph is going to, or the actual line that\\nrepresents the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation\\nis going to look like, it's going to look like this. I'll just try. So I can make it go, it's\\ngoing to look like... It's going to go through those two points. So it going to...I can make\\nit go the other way too. Let me see. It's going to go through those two points and so it's going to\\nlook something like that. Now what are its' x and y-intercepts? Well, we already kind of figured it out but the intercepts themselves, these are the points on the graph where they intersect the axes. So this right over here,\\nthis is the y-intercept. That point is the y-intercept and it happens, it's\\nalways going to happen when x = 0, and when x\\n= 0 we know that y = 5. It's that point, the point 0, 5. And what is the y inter...what\\nis the x-intercept? The x-intercept is the\\npoint, it's actually the same x-intercept for this\\nequation right over here. It's the point 6, 0. That\\npoint right over there. \"),\n",

We're sitting on the x-axis. So let's think about what\\nthis x value must be. Well, just trying to\\neyeball a little bit, it's a little over 2. It's between 2 and 3.

Well, 2 times 0 is\\njust going to be 0, so we have 3x is equal to 7. Then we can divide both\\nsides by 3 to solve for x, and we get x is equal to 7/3. Does that look like 7/3? Well, we just have\\nto remind ourselves that 7/3 is the same\\nthing as 6/3 plus 1/3. And 6/3 is 2. So this is the same\\nthing as 2 and 1/3. Another way you could\\nthink about it is 3 goes into 7 two times, and\\nthen you have a remainder of 1. So you've still got\\nto divide that 1 by 3.

So whenever someone talks about\\nintercepts, they're talking about where you're\\nintersecting the x and the y-axes. So let me label my axes here, so\\nthis is the x-axis and that is the y-axis there. And when I intersect the x-axis,\\nwhat's going on? What is my y value when\\nI'm at the x-axis? Well, my y value is 0, I'm not\\nabove or below the x-axis. Let me write this down. The x-intercept is when y\\nis equal to 0, right? And then by that same\\nargument, what's the y-intercept? Well, if I'm somewhere along the\\ny-axis, what's my x value? Well, I'm not to the right or\\nthe left, so my x value has to be 0, so the y-intercept occurs\\nwhen x is equal to 0. So to figure out the intercepts,\\nlet's set y equal to 0 in this equation and solve\\nfor x, and then let's set x is equal to 0 and\\nthen solve for y. So when y is equal to 0, what\\ndoes this equation become? I'll do it in orange. You get negative 5x plus 4y. Well we're saying y is 0, so\\n4 times 0 is equal to 20. 4 times 0 is just 0, so we\\ncan just not write that. So let me just rewrite it. So we have negative\\n5x is equal to 20. We can divide both sides of this\\nequation by negative 5. The negative 5 cancel out,\\nthat was the whole point behind dividing by negative 5,\\nand we get x is equal to 20 divided by negative\\n5 is negative 4. So when y is equal to 0, we\\nsaw that right there, x is equal to negative 4. Or if we wanted to plot that\\npoint, we always put the x coordinate first, so that\\nwould be the point negative 4 comma 0. So let me graph that. So if we go 1, 2, 3, 4. That's a negative 4. And then the y value is\\njust 0, so that point is right over there. That is the x-intercept, y\\nis 0, x is negative 4. Notice we're intersecting\\nthe x-axis. Now let's do the exact same\\nthing for the y-intercept. Let's set x equal to 0, so if\\nwe set x is equal to 0, we have negative 5 times 0 plus\\n4y is equal to 20. Well, anything times 0 is\\n0, so we can just put that out of the way. And remember, this was setting\\nx is equal to 0, we're doing the y-intercept now. So this just simplifies\\nto 4y is equal to 20. We can divide both sides of this\\nequation by 4 to get rid of this 4 right there, and you\\nget y is equal to 20 over 4, which is 5.

This is our y-axis. This is our x-axis. The y-intercept is where\\nwe intersect the y-axis. Now, what do we know\\nabout the y-intercept? Well, at the y-intercept x\\nis going to be equal to 0. So this is the point\\n0 comma something. And so when people\\nare talking about, what is your y-intercept? They're usually\\nsaying, well, what is the y-coordinate\\nwhen x equals 0.

And they already tell us that\\nwhen x is negative 2, y is 8. And I actually want\\nto think about what happens when x is\\nnegative 1, when x is 0. Then they tell us\\nwhen x is 1, y is 2. When x is 2, y is 0. This right over here\\nis the x-intercept. When x is 4, y is negative 4. So they skip 2 right over\\nhere. y is negative 4. So let's just see how y changes\\nwith respect to changes in x. So when we go here, when x\\nchanges by 1, y goes down by 2. And it's a line, so\\nit's going to have a constant rate of change\\nof y with respect to x. So similarly, when\\nx increases by 1, y is going to decrease by 2. So y is going to be 6 here. When x increases by 1 again,\\ny is going to decrease by 2. So we're going to get to 4. And we see it works. Because if we\\nincrease by 1 again, then it is indeed the case\\nthat y decreased by 2. And you see here when\\nwe increase x by 2, then y decreases\\nat twice the rate. Because now we didn't\\njust increase by 1, we increased by 2. So now y is going\\nto decrease by 4. And what's constant\\nhere is your change in y over your change in x. When x increases by\\n1, y decreases by 2. When x increases by\\n2, y decreases by 4. Either way you think\\nabout it, your change in y for a unit\\nchange in x is going to be equal to negative 2.

The graph below shows the relationship between the amount of water\\nleft in the tub in liters and how much time had passed in minutes since Glen started draining the tub. And then they ask us a few questions. How much water was in the tub\\nwhen Glen started draining? How much water drains every minute? Every two minutes? How long does it take for\\nthe tub to drain completely? Pause this video and see if\\nyou can answer any or all of these questions based on\\nthis graph right over here. All right, now let's do it together. And let's start with this first question. How much water was in the tub\\nwhen Glen started draining? So what we see here is\\nwhen we're talking about when Glen started draining, that would be at time t equals zero. So time t equals zero is right over here. And then so how much water is in the tub? It's right over there. And this point, when\\nyou're looking at a graph, often has a special label. If you view this as the y-axis, the vertical axis as the y-axis and the horizontal axis as the x-axis, although when you're measuring time, sometimes people will call it the t-axis. But for the sake of this video,\\nlet's call this the x-axis. This point at which you\\nintersect the y-axis that tells you what is y when x is zero? Or what is the water in\\nthe tub when time is zero? So this tells you, the y-intercept\\nhere tells you how much, in this case, how much water\\nwe started off with in the tub. And we can see it's 15 liters if I'm reading that graph correctly. How much water drains every minute? Every two minutes? Pause this video. How would you think about that? All right, so they're\\nreally asking about a rate. What's the rate at which\\nwater's draining every minute? So let's see if we can find\\ntwo points on this graph that look pretty clear. So right over there at time one minute, looks like there's 12\\nliters in it, in the tub. And then at time two minutes,\\nthink there's nine liters. So it looks like as one minute passes, so we go plus one minute, plus one minute, what happens\\nto the water in the tub? Well, it looks like the water\\nin the tub goes down by, went from 12 liters to nine liters. So negative three liters. And this is a line, so\\nthat should keep happening. So if we forward another plus one minute, we should go down another three liters, and that is exactly what is happening. So it looks like the tub is draining three liters per minute. So draining three liters per minute. And so if they say every two minutes, well, if you're doing three\\nliters per every one minute, then you're going to do twice\\nas much every two minutes. So six liters every two minutes. Two minutes. But all of this, the second question, we were able to answer\\nby looking at the slope. So in this context, y-intercept\\nto help us figure out, well, where did we start off? The slope is telling us the rate at which the water in\\nthis case is changing. And then they ask us how long does it take for the tub to drain completely? Pause this video and see\\nif you can answer that. Well, the situation in which\\nthe tub has drained completely, that means the there's\\nno water left in the tub. So that means that our y-value, our water value is down at zero. And that happens on the\\ngraph right over there. And this point where the\\ngraph intersects the x-axis, that's known as the x-intercept. And in this context, it says, hey, at what x-value do we not\\nhave any of the y-value left? The water has run out. And we see that happens\\nat an x-value of five, but that's giving us the time in minutes. So that happens at five minutes. After five minutes, all\\nof the water has drained. And that makes us a lot of sense. If you have 15 liters and you're draining three\\nliters every minute, it makes sense that it takes five minutes to drain all 15 liters. \"),\n",

What feature of the graph represents how long it took Flynn\\nto pay back the loan? Pause this video, see if\\nyou can figure that out. All right, now let's go\\nthrough each of these choices. So the first one is the slope. So the slope tells us how much do we change in\\nthe vertical direction for any given change in\\nthe horizontal direction. So for example, if we start from here, we can see that if one week goes by, we go from one week to two weeks, we can see that our loan went down. It went from $15 to $10. So when we had plus one weeks in time, our loan went down by $5. And then that happens over the next week. And that rate of how\\nquickly the loan is paid, that's what the slope tells us. And it would be constant over the course of the entire time period\\nis what makes this a line, is that slope is always\\ngoing to be constant. So the slope is useful for the rate at which the loan is being paid back, but it's not the clearest\\nway to figure out how long it took Flynn\\nto pay back the loan. So I would rule that one out. The x-intercept, that's\\nwhere the graph intersects the horizontal axis, which is often referred to as the x-axis. Or another way to think about it, that tells us, that\\nsays, what is the x-value when our vertical value, our\\ny-value, is equal to zero? And our y-value is the money owed. So it says, hey how much\\ntime has passed when we owe, when we don't owe any more money or when Flynn doesn't owe\\nany more money to his sister? Well that's exactly\\nwhat they're asking for. How long did it take Flynn\\nto pay back the loan? And that's what that x-intercept tells us. It took him four weeks. After four weeks, he\\ndidn't owe any more money to his sister. So I like this choice,\\nbut let's just review the other ones. The y-intercept, well\\nthat's where the graph intersects the y-axis right over there. This tells us what's going\\non at time t equals zero. At time t equal zero or time equal zero, when the horizontal\\nvariable is equal to zero, we see that Flynn owes $20. So this one isn't valuable\\nfor figuring out when he, how long it takes to pay it back. This one is useful for figuring out how much did he owe initially. So we'll rule that one out. And we already picked one choice, so we can rule out none of the above. \"),\n",

Two weeks after initially opening the bag, he decided to start weighing\\nhow much food remained in the bag on a weekly basis. Here's some of his data. So we see after 14 days,\\nthere's 14 kilograms remaining. Then after another seven days pass by, so now we're at 21 days\\nfrom the beginning, there's only 10.5 kilograms left. Then after 28 days there\\nare seven kilograms left. All right, so we are going\\nto try to use this data to start answering some\\ninteresting questions, and maybe we'll also try to\\nvisualize it with a graph. So the first thing that\\nwe might try to tackle is well how much food was\\nin the bag to begin with if we assume that he's using the same amount of food every week. So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. How much food was in the bag to begin with if we assume that Felipe\\nis feeding his dog the same amount every week? Okay now there's several ways to do this, but to help us visualize this, let me see if I can graph\\nthe data that we have and then see what would happen\\nas we approach the beginning of this, of what's going\\non here, the dog feeding, and maybe as we go to the end as well. So let's see, this is my\\nx-axis, this is my y-axis. I'm going to make x-axis\\nmeasure the passage of the days, so number of days on the x-axis. And on the y-axis I'm going to measure, I'm gonna measure food remaining,\\nand that is in kilograms. And let's see, it looks like\\nmaybe if my scale goes up to, let's make this five, 10, 15, 20, and then 25, I can make\\nit a little higher, 25, I think this will be sufficient. And then we wanna go up to 28 days, and it looks like they're\\nmeasuring everything on a weekly basis, so let's say that this is seven, 14, 21, and then 28. And they gave us some data points. So after 14 days, there's\\n14 kilograms remaining, so 14 days, there's 14\\nkilograms remaining, right over there. After 21 days, there's\\n10.5 kilograms remaining, 21 days, 10.5 is right about there. After 28 days there's\\nseven kilograms remaining, so after 28 days, seven kilograms. And we're assuming the rate of the dog food usage is the same, that he's feeding his dog\\nthe same amount every week. And so this would describe a line, that the rate is going to\\nbe the slope of that line, and then if we can plot this line, if we know where that line\\nintersects the x and y-axes, we might be able to figure\\nout some other things. So actually let me draw a line here, let me see if I can use\\nthis little line tool to connect the dots in a reasonable way. So let's say it looks something\\nlike that, that's our line, that'll describe how quickly\\nhe is using his dog food. So let me make sure that this dot is, should be on the line as well. Now let's try to answer\\nthat first question, and think about how we might do it. How much food was in\\nthe bag to begin with? So what point here\\nrepresents how much food was in the bag to begin with? Well that's the amount of\\nfood remaining at day zero, at the beginning of this, so that would be this\\npoint right over here, would describe how much food\\nwas in the bag to begin with. This would be the y-intercept,\\ny-intercept is when our x value is equal to\\nzero, what is our y value. And when we just look at it, the graph, it looks like it's a little bit over 20, but we could find the exact value by thinking about the slope,\\nwhich is thinking about the rate at which the dog\\nfood is being depleted. We can see that every week,\\nevery week that goes by, or every seven days that goes by, it looks like we use 3.5 kilograms. Or another way to think about it, every two weeks it looks like\\nwe use an entire kilogram. So let me put it this way, when we go plus 14 days, plus 14 days, it looks like we use up, or the\\nfood remaining goes does by, goes down every two weeks it\\ngoes down by seven kilograms, seven kilograms, negative seven kilograms. So if we wanna figure\\nout this exact value, we just have to reverse things. If we are going back 14 days, then we are going to\\ngo up seven kilograms. So if we were at 14, up seven kilograms, this right over here is\\nthe point zero comma 21. So how much food did Felipe\\nstart with in the bag? 21 kilograms, and we got\\nthat from the y-intercept. Now another question is how much is Felipe feeding his dog everyday. Pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. Well we know every 14 days he's feeding the dog seven kilograms, so one way to think about it is, and we're really looking at the slope here to figure out the rate at\\nwhich he's feeding his dog. So the slope is equal\\nto our change in the y, so negative seven kilograms, every our change in the x, every 14 days, and so seven over 14 is\\nthe same thing as 1/2, so this is equal to negative\\n1/2 of a kilogram per day. So this tells us everyday\\nthe food remaining is going down half a kilogram, so that means he's feeding his dog, assuming his dog is eating\\nthe food and finishing it, that his dog is eating\\nhalf a kilogram a day. And if we wanted to ask another question, how many days will the bag last? How would you think about that? And we know it's going\\nto be out here someplace, if we just continue that line, because this point right over here, where our line intersects the x-axis, that would be our x-intercept, that is the x value when\\nour y value is zero, and our y is the amount of food remaining. So we wanna know what day do\\nwe have no food remaining. And we could try to estimate it, or we could figure out it exactly. We know that every 14 days\\nwe use up seven kilograms. So if we are at seven, as\\nwe are right over here, and we go 14 days in the future, we should use up the\\nremaining contents of the bag, so plus 14 days we're going to use up the remaining seven kilograms. And so this should happen\\n14 days after the 28th day, so this is going to be the 42nd day. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're told\\nKaya rode her bicycle toward a tree at a constant speed. The table below shows the relationship between her distance to the tree and how many times her front tire rotated. So once her tire rotated four times, she was 22 1/2 meters from the tree. Then once she's rotated eight times, she's 12 1/2 meters from the tree. When it rotated 12 times, then she's only 2 1/2 meters to the tree. So she's getting closer and closer the more rotations that her tire has had. So then they ask us some questions here. So they ask us how far away\\nwas the tree to begin with? How far does Kaya travel\\nwith each rotation? How many rotations did it\\ntake to get to the tree? So like always, pause this video, and see if you can answer these questions on your own before we do it together. So let's start with the first question. How far away was the tree to begin with? So the way that I would think about it is, after four rotations, we're\\n22 1/2 meters from the tree. We see that if we increase\\nby another four rotations, so let's say plus four rotations, we see that we have gotten\\n10 meters closer to the tree, or our distance to the tree\\nhas gone down by 10 meters. So I'll write negative 10 meters here. If we want to figure out how\\nfar the tree was to begin with, we have to go back to zero rotations. So if we're going back by four, so we're subtracting\\nfour from the rotations. And if we're going at a constant rate, well, then we would add 10 meters. So we would add 10 meters. If we add four rotations,\\nwe get 10 meters closer. If we take away four rotations, to get us back to zero rotations, then we will go 10 meters further. So that would be at 32.5 meters. So 32.5 meters is how far the tree was to begin with when Kaya\\nhad zero rotations. The next question is\\nhow far does Kaya travel with each rotation? All right, well, we already\\nsaw that with four rotations, she's traveling 10 meters, so we could say 10 meters in four rotations. So if we divide both of these\\nby four, what would we get? Well, that's the same thing as\\n2 1/2 meters in one rotation. So this is 2.5 meters. And last but not least, how many rotations did it\\ntake to get to the tree? Well, we know that after 12 rotations, she's only 2 1/2 meters\\naway from the tree. We also know that in every one rotation, she gets 2 1/2 meters closer. So she only needs one more rotation to cover this next 2 1/2 meters. So, if we go plus one rotations, we're going to go down 2 1/2 meters. We're going to go 2 1/2\\nmeters closer to the tree, and we will be at the tree. So how many rotations did it take to get to the tree in total? 13 rotations. Now one thing that's\\ninteresting is to think about what we just did in a graphical context that you might have seen before. And if we were to put on the\\nhorizontal axis rotations and if we were to put on the vertical axis distance to the tree, distance to tree, I'll just call the\\nvertical axis the y-axis and the horizontal axis the x-axis, well, we could see here\\nthat we have zero, four, eight, 12, I could go to 16. And then we saw that at zero rotations, we are 32.5 meters from the tree, so 32.5. This is all going to be in meters. So this first question was\\nreally another way of asking what is our y-intercept? And this next question, how far does Kaya travel\\nwith each rotation, well, we saw that when you\\nincrease your rotations by four, your distance to the tree\\ngoes down by 10 meters. So when this is plus four, we went down, we went down 10 meters. So it's negative 10 meters. So really what we were thinking\\nabout right here, this is, you could think about the\\nmagnitude of the slope. The slope of this line, the slope of this line that\\nwould describe her distance to the tree as based on\\nthe number of rotations, the slope is going to be\\nour change in our distance, which is negative 10, four, our change in rotations, over four. So the slope of this line is negative 2.5 meters per rotation. But when they say how far does Kaya travel with each rotation, she's\\ngetting 2 1/2 meters closer. Her distance from the tree\\ngoes down by 2 1/2 meters. And this last question, how many rotations did it\\ntake to get to the tree, well, at what point is our y value, our distance to the tree, zero? And we saw that it is at 13 rotations. So this is another way of thinking about what was the x-intercept? So the line, it's a line because we\\nknow that she's traveling at a constant rate, looks\\nsomething like that. So they really were\\nasking us the y-intercept, the slope, and the x-intercept. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] There's\\na lot of different ways that you could represent\\na linear equation. So for example, if you\\nhad the linear equation y is equal to 2x plus three, that's one way to represent it, but I could represent this in\\nan infinite number of ways. I could, let's see, I could subtract 2x from both sides, I could write this as negative 2x plus y is equal to three. I could manipulate it in\\nways where I get it to, and I'm gonna do it right now, but this is another way of\\nwriting that same thing. y minus five is equal to\\ntwo times x minus one. You could actually simplify this and you could get either\\nthis equation here or that equation up on top. These are all equivalent,\\nyou can get from one to the other with logical\\nalgebraic operations. So there's an infinite number of ways to represent a given linear equation, but I what I wanna focus on in this video is this representation in particular, because this one is a\\nvery useful representation of a linear equation and\\nwe'll see in future videos, this one and this one can also be useful, depending on what you are looking for, but we're gonna focus on this one, and this one right over\\nhere is often called slope-intercept form. Slope-intercept form. And hopefully in a few minutes, it will be obvious why it\\ncalled slop-intercept form. And before I explain that\\nto you, let's just try to graph this thing. I'm gonna try to graph it, I'm just gonna plot some points here, so x comma y, and I'm\\ngonna pick some x values where it's easy to calculate the y values. So maybe the easiest is\\nif x is equal to zero. If x is equal to zero, then\\ntwo times zero is zero, that term goes away, and\\nyou're only left with this term right over here, y is equal to three. Y is equal to three. And so if we were to plot this. Actually let me start plotting it, so that is my y axis, and let me do the x axis, so that can be my x, oh that's not as straight as I would like it. So that looks pretty good, alright. That is my x axis and let me mark off some hash marks here,\\nso this is x equals one, x equals two, x equals three, this is y equals one, y equals two, y equals three, and obviously I could keep going and keep going, this would be\\ny is equal to negative one, this would be x is equal to negative one, negative two, negative three, so on and so forth. So this point right over\\nhere, zero comma three, this is x is zero, y is three. Well, the point that represents\\nwhen x is equal to zero and y equals three, this is, we're right on the y axis. If they have a line going\\nthrough it and this line contains this point, this is\\ngoing to be the y- intercept. So one way to think about it,\\nthe reason why this is called slope-intercept form is it's very easy to calculate the y-intercept. The y-intercept here is going to happen when it's written in this form, it's going to happen\\nwhen x is equal to zero and y is equal to three, it's gonna be this point right over here. So it's very easy to\\nfigure out the intercept, the y-intercept from this form. Now you might be saying, well it says slope-intercept form, it must also be easy to figure out the slope from this form. And if you made that conclusion, you would be correct! And we're about to see\\nthat in a few seconds. So let's plot some more points here and I'm just gonna keep\\nincreasing x by one. So if you increase x by\\none, so we could write that our delta x, our change\\nin x, delta Greek letter, this triangle is a Greek letter, delta, represents change in. Change in x here is one. We just increased x by\\none, what's gonna be our corresponding change in y? What's going to be our change in y? So let's see, when x is equal to one, we have two times one, plus three is going to be five. So our change in y is going to be two. Let's do that again. Let's increase our x by one. Change in x is equal to one. So then if we're gonna increase by one, we're gonna go from x equals one to x equals two. Well what's our corresponding change in y? Well when x is equal to two, two times two is four,\\nplus three is seven. Well our change in y, our\\nchange in y is equal to two. Went from five- when x went from one to two, y went from five to seven. So for every one that we increase x, y is increasing by two. So for this linear\\nequation, our change in y over change in x is always going to be, our change in y is two when\\nour change in x is one, or it's equal to two, or we could say that our\\nslope is equal to two. Well let's just graph this to make sure that we understand this. So when x equals one, y is equal to five. And actually we're gonna\\nhave to graph five up here. So when x is equal to one, y is equal to, and actually this is a little bit higher, this, let me clean this up a little bit. So this one would be, erase that a little bit. Just like that. So that's y is equal to four, and this is y is equal to five. So when x is one, y is equal to five, so it's that point right over there. So our line is going to look- you only need two points to define a line, our line is going to like, let me do this in this\\ncolor right over here. Our line is going to look like, is going to look, is going to look something like, is going to look, let me see if I can, I didn't draw it completely at scale, but it's going to look\\nsomething like this. This is the line, this is the line, y is equal to 2x plus three. But we already figured out\\nthat its slope is equal to two, when our change in x is one, when our change in x is\\none, our change in y is two. If our change in x was negative one, if our change in x was negative one, our change in y is negative two. And you can see that,\\nif from zero we went, we went down one, if we\\nwent to negative one, then what's our y going to be? Two times negative one is negative two plus three is one. So we see that, the point\\nnegative one comma one is on the line as well. So the slope here, our\\nchange in y over change in x, if we're going from between any two points on this line, is always going to be two. But where do you see two\\nin this original equation? Well you see the two right over here. And when you write something\\nin slop-intercept form, where you explicitly solve for y, y is equal to some constant\\ntimes x to the first power plus some other constant,\\nthe second one is going to be your intercept, your y-intercept, or it's going to be a way to\\nfigure out the y-intercept, the intercept itself is this\\npoint, the point at which the line intercepts the y axis, and then this two is going\\nto represent your slope. And that makes sense because\\nevery time you increase x by one, you're gonna\\nmultiply that by two, so you're gonna increase y by two. So this is just a, kinda\\nof a get your feet wet with the idea of slope-intercept form, but you'll see, at least for\\nme, this is the easiest form for me to think about what the graph of something looks like, because if you were given another, if you were given another linear equation, let's say y is equal to negative x, negative x plus two. Well immediately you say, okay look, my yintercept is going to be the point zero comma two, so I'm\\ngonna intersect the y axis right at that point, and\\nthen I have a slope of, the coefficient here is\\nreally just negative one, so I have a slope of negative one. So as we increase x by one, we're gonna decrease y by one. Increase x by one, you're\\ngonna decrease y by one. If you increase x by two,\\nyou're gonna decrease y by two. And so our line is gonna\\nlook something like this. Let me see if I can draw\\nit relatively neatly. It's going to look something, I think I can do a little\\nbit better than that. It's 'cus my graph paper is hand drawn. It's not ideal, but I think you get, you get the point. It's gonna look something like that. So from slope-intercept form, very easy to figure out\\nwhat the y-intercept is, and very easy to figure out the slope. The slope here, slope\\nhere is negative one. That's this negative one right over here, and the y-intercept, y-intercept is the point zero comma two, very easy to figure out 'cus essentially that gave you the information right there. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] What I'd\\nlike to do in this video is a few more examples recognizing the slope and\\ny-intercept given an equation. So, let's start with something that we might already recognize. Let's say we have something of the form y is equal to five x plus three. What is the slope and the\\ny-intercept in this example here? Well, we've already talked about that we can have something\\nin slope intercept form where it has a form y\\nis equal to the slope, which people use the letter m for, the slope times x plus the y-intercept, which people use the letter b for. So, if we just look at this, m is going to be the coefficient\\non x right over there. So, m is equal to five. That is the slope. And b is just going to be this\\nconstant term, plus three. So, b is equal to three. So, this is your y-intercept. So, that's pretty straightforward but let's see a few slightly\\nmore involved examples. Let's say if we had\\nform y is equal to five plus three x, what is the slope and the\\ny-intercept in this situation? Well, it might have\\ntaken you a second or two to realize how this earlier equation is different than the one I just wrote. Here, it's not five x, it's just five, and this isn't three, it's three x. So, if you wanna write it in the same form as we have up there, you can just swap the\\nfive and the three x. It doesn't matter which one comes first, you're just adding the two, so you can rewrite it as y is\\nequal to three x plus five. And then it becomes a little bit clear that our slope is three, the\\ncoefficient on the x term, and our y-intercept is five, y-intercept. Let's do another example. Let's say that we have the equation y is equal to 12 minus x. Pause this video and see if\\nyou can determine the slope and the y-intercept. All right, so, something\\nsimilar is going on here that we had over here. The standard form, slope intercept form, we're used to seeing the x\\nterm before the constant term, so we might wanna do that over here. So, we could rewrite this as y is equal to negative x plus 12, negative x plus 12. And so, from this, you\\nmight immediately recognize, okay, my constant term, when it's in this form, that's my b, that is my y-intercept. So, that's my y-intercept\\nright over there. But what's my slope? Well, the slope is the\\ncoefficient on the x term but all you see is a negative\\nhere, what's the coefficient? Well, you can view negative x as the same thing as negative one x. So, your slope here is\\ngoing to be negative one. Let's do another example. Let's say that we had the\\nequation y is equal to five x. What's the slope and y-intercept there? At first, you might say, hey, this looks nothing\\nlike what we have up here. I only have one term on the right-hand side\\nof the equality sign. Here, I have two. But you could just view\\nthis as five x plus zero, and then it might jump out at you that our y-intercept is zero and our slope is a\\ncoefficient on the x term. It is equal to five. Let's do one more example. Let's say we had y is\\nequal to negative seven, what's the slope and y-intercept there? Well, once again, you might say, hey, this doesn't look\\nlike what we had up here, how do we figure out the\\nslope or the y-intercept? Well, we could do a similar idea. We could say, hey, this is the same thing as y is equal to zero times x minus seven. And so now, it looks just\\nlike what we have over here and you might recognize that our y-intercept is negative seven, y-intercept is equal to negative seven. And our slope is a\\ncoefficient on the x term, it is equal to zero. And that makes sense. For a given change in x, you\\nwould expect zero change in y 'cause y is always negative\\nseven in this situation. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Sal] Let's do some practice examples from our intro to slope\\ny intercept exercise. What is the slope of y is equal to negative four x minus three? So you might already recognize, this is in slope intercept form. Just as a reminder,\\nslope intercept form is y is equal to mx plus b, where the coefficient on\\nthis x term right over here, that is our slope, and then this constant right over here, that is going to give\\nyou your y intercept. So if they're saying,\\nwhat is the slope here? Well I just need to figure out, what is the coefficient on this x term? And you can see that the coefficient here is a negative four. So that is going to be our m, that is going to be our slope. Now just as a reminder,\\nyou have to make sure that it's solved in this way, that is is solved for y, y is equal to something\\ntimes x minus three, so that's our slope. Let's do another one of these. So we're asked, what is the y intercept of y is equal to negative\\nthree x minus two? So once again we already have\\nit in slope intercept form. It's already been solved for y. It's of the form y is equal to mx plus b, where m, our slope, is\\ngiven right over here, negative three. But they're not asking for our slope, they're asking for the y intercept. Well the y intercept is given by b here, so b is negative two. Pay close attention to the sign here. So b is equal to negative two. But when I look at these choices, I don't see a b is equal to negative two, so what are they talking about? Well a y intercept is, what is the y value\\nwhen x is equal to zero? And you could see that here, if x was equal to zero\\nthen that term goes away and y is equal to b. So if you want to know the point where the graph described by this equation intercepts the y axis, well it's going to be what\\nis y when x is equal to zero? Well when x is equal to zero,\\ny is equal to negative two. And you could see that in\\nour original equation, again. If x were zero, this term would go away, and y would be equal to negative two. So zero, comma, negative two. So it would be that\\nchoice right over there. On Khan Academy obviously you\\njust have to click on that, you don't have to shade it in. Let's do one more. Complete the equation of the\\nline whose slope is five, and y intercept is zero, comma, four. So once again the general form is y is equal to our slope times x, if I want to put it in\\nslope intercept form, plus our y intercept. Well they're telling\\nus, our slope is five. Whose slope is five. So we know that m is going to be five. And they tell us that the\\ny intercept is zero, four. So the y intercept, b,\\nthat is the value of y when x is equal to zero. So the value of y when x equals zero is this four right over here. So that is going to be four. So I could say y is equal to five times x plus four. And when you're actually\\nentering it on Khan Academy, you would just type it in, or if you're using the app you would use it with your finger. And I always make the\\nmistake of writing y equals, and I type in y equals five x plus four. Notice they already gave you\\nthe y equals right over there. That's all you have to do, recognize the slope, the y intercept, and then remember what the slope\\nintercept form actually is. \"),\n",

Q represents the\\ntemperature in Quinn's home in degrees Celsius after t minutes. This Q is equal to 15 plus 0.4t. What was the temperature when\\nQuinn returned from vacation? So pause this video and see if you can work\\nthis out on your own. All right, so they wanna\\nknow the temperature and you might get a little confused, hey maybe t is for temperature. No, t is time in minutes. Temperature is Q. Q represents the temperature. So they really wanna know is, what was Q when Quinn\\nreturned from vacation? Well, right when Quinn\\nreturned from vacation, that is when t is equal to zero. So this is equivalent to saying, what is Q, our temperature,\\nwhen zero minutes have elapsed? Well, if you go back to\\nthis original equation, we see that Q is equal to 15 plus 0.4 times the amount\\nof elapsed time in minutes. So that's times zero. So that's just going to\\nbe 15 degrees Celsius. If you're familiar with\\nslope intercept form, you could think of it as our temperature is equal to 0.4 times\\nthe elapsed time plus 15. So t equals zero, you're\\nleft with just this term which in many cases we\\nview as our y-intercept. What is going on right when\\nwe're just getting started? Right when our horizontal\\nvariable is equal to zero. And our horizontal variable in this situation is elapsed time. How much do the temperature\\nincrease every minute? There's a couple of ways\\nyou can think about this. One if you recognize, this\\nis slope intercept form. You could see that 0.4 is the slope. So that says for every one minute change in time, you're going to have an\\nincrease in temperature by 0.4 degrees Celsius. So you could do it that way. You could try out some values. You could say, all\\nright, let me think about what Q is going to be based on t. So time, t equals zero\\nright when you got home. We're to figure out that the temperature\\nis 15 degrees Celsius. At t equals one, what happens? It's going to be 15 plus 0.4 times one. That's just gonna be 15.4. Notice, when we increased our time by one, our temperature increased\\nby 0.4 degrees Celsius by the slope. And what happened again\\nif we increased time by another minute, if\\nwe go from one to two, we would get two, 15.8. We would increase\\ntemperature by another 0.4. How much will the temperature increase if Quinn leaves the\\nheat on for 20 minutes? Pause the video and see\\nif you can solve that. All right, now we have to be careful here. They're not asking us what is the temperature after 20 minutes. They're saying, how much\\nwill the temperature increase if he leaves the heat on for 20 minutes? If we just wanna know\\nwhat is the temperature after 20 minutes, we would just say, okay, what is Q when t is equal to 20? So it'd be 15 plus 0.4 times 20. 0.4 times 20 is eight. Eight plus 15 is 23. So it's 23 degrees\\nCelsius after 20 minutes. But that's not what they're asking us. They're asking, how much will\\nthe temperature increase? Well, where did we start from? We started from 15 degrees Celsius and now after 20 minutes we\\nhave gone to 23 degrees Celsius. So we have increased by\\neight degrees Celsius. Or, another way to think about it, we have increased by this\\namount right over here. We started at 15 and after 20 minutes, we have increased by 0.4 times 20 which is eight degrees Celsius.

And the general way of writing\\nit is y is equal to mx plus b, where m is the slope. And here in this case, m is\\nequal to 1/3-- so let me write that down-- m is equal to 1/3,\\nand b is the y-intercept. So in this case, b is\\nequal to negative 2. And you know that b is the\\ny-intercept, because we know that the y-intercept occurs\\nwhen x is equal to 0. So if x is equal to 0 in either\\nof these situations, this term just becomes 0 and\\ny will be equal to b. So that's what we mean by\\nb is the y-intercept. So whenever you look at an\\nequation in this form, it's actually fairly straightforward to graph this line. b is the y-intercept. In this case it is negative 2,\\nso that means that this line must intersect the y-axis at y\\nis equal to negative 2, so it's this point right here. Negative 1, negative 2, this\\nis the point 0, negative 2. If you don't believe me, there's\\nnothing magical about this, try evaluating or\\ntry solving for y when x is equal to 0. When x is equal to 0, this term\\ncancels out and you're just left with y is equal\\nto negative 2. So that's the y-intercept\\nright there. Now, this 1/3 tells us the\\nslope of the line. How much do we change in\\ny for any change in x? So this tells us that\\n1/3, so that right there, is the slope. So it tells us that 1/3 is equal\\nto the change in y over the change in x. Or another way to think about\\nit, if x changes by 3, then y would change by 1. So let me graph that. So we know that this point is\\non the graph, that's the y-intercept. The slope tells us that if x\\nchanges by 3-- so let me go 3 three to the right, 1, 2, 3--\\nthat y will change by 1. So this must also be a\\npoint on the graph. And we could keep doing that. If x changes by 3,\\ny changes by 1. If x goes down by 3, y\\nwill go down by 1. If x goes down by 6, y\\nwill go down by 2. It's that same ratio, so\\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2. And you can see all of these\\npoints are on the line, and the line is the graph of\\nthis equation up here. So let me graph it. So it'll look something\\nlike that. And you're done. \"),\n",

       "  \"So you may or may not already\\nknow that any linear equation can be written in the form\\ny is equal to mx plus b. Where m is the slope\\nof the line. The same slope that we've\\nbeen dealing with the last few videos. The rise over run of the line. Or the inclination\\nof the line. And b is the y-intercept. I think it's pretty easy\\nto verify that b is a y-intercept. The way you verify that is you\\nsubstitute x is equal to 0. If you get x is equal to 0--\\nremember x is equal to 0, that means that's where we're going\\nto intercept at the y-axis. If x is equal to 0, this\\nequation becomes y is equal to m times 0 plus b. m times 0 is just\\ngoing to be 0. I don't care what m is. So then y is going\\nto be equal to b. So the point 0, b is going\\nto be on that line. The line will intercept the\\ny-axis at the point y is equal to b. We'll see that with\\nactual numbers in the next few videos. Just to verify for you that m\\nis really the slope, let's just try some numbers out. We know the point 0,\\nb is on the line. What happens when\\nx is equal to 1? You get y is equal\\nto m times 1. Or it's equal to m plus b. So we also know that the\\npoint 1, m plus b is also on the line. Right? This is just the y value. So what's the slope between\\nthat point and that point? Let's take this as the end\\npoint, so you have m plus b, our change in y, m plus b minus\\nb over our change in x, over 1 minus 0. This is our change in\\ny over change in x. We're using two points. That's our end point. That's our starting point. So if you simplify this,\\nb minus b is 0. 1 minus 0 is 1. So you get m/1, or you\\nget it's equal to m. So hopefully you're satisfied\\nand hopefully I didn't confuse you by stating it in the\\nabstract with all of these variables here. But this is definitely going\\nto be the slope and this is definitely going to be\\nthe y-intercept. Now given that, what I want to\\ndo in this exercise is look at these graphs and then use the\\nalready drawn graphs to figure out the equation. So we're going to look at these,\\nfigure out the slopes, figure out the y-intercepts and\\nthen know the equation. So let's do this line A first.\\nSo what is A's slope? Let's start at some\\narbitrary point. Let's start right over there. We want to get even numbers. If we run one, two, three. So if delta x is equal to 3. Right? One, two, three. Our delta y-- and I'm just doing\\nit because I want to hit an even number here-- our delta\\ny is equal to-- we go down by 2-- it's equal\\nto negative 2. So for A, change in\\ny for change in x. When our change in x is 3, our\\nchange in y is negative 2. So our slope is negative 2/3. When we go over by 3, we're\\ngoing to go down by 2. Or if we go over by 1, we're\\ngoing to go down by 2/3. You can't exactly see it there,\\nbut you definitely see it when you go over by 3. So that's our slope. We've essentially done\\nhalf of that problem. Now we have to figure\\nout the y-intercept. So that right there is our m. Now what is our b? Our y-intercept. Well where does this intersect\\nthe y-axis? Well we already said\\nthe slope is 2/3. So this is the point\\ny is equal to 2. When we go over by 1 to the\\nright, we would have gone down by 2/3. So this right here must\\nbe the point 1 1/3. Or another way to say it,\\nwe could say it's 4/3. That's the point y\\nis equal to 4/3. Right there. A little bit more than 1. About 1 1/3. So we could say b\\nis equal to 4/3. So we'll know that the equation\\nis y is equal to m, negative 2/3, x plus\\nb, plus 4/3. That's equation A. Let's do equation B. Hopefully we won't have\\nto deal with as many fractions here. Equation B. Let's figure out its slope\\nfirst. Let's start at some reasonable point. We could start at that point. Let me do it right here. B. Equation B. When our delta x is equal\\nto-- let me write it this way, delta x. So our delta x could be 1. When we move over 1 to the\\nright, what happens to our delta y? We go up by 3. delta x. delta y. Our change in y is 3. So delta y over delta x, When\\nwe go to the right, our change in x is 1. Our change in y is positive 3. So our slope is equal to 3. What is our y-intercept? Well, when x is equal to\\n0, y is equal to 1. So b is equal to 1. So this was a lot easier. Here the equation is y is\\nequal to 3x plus 1. Let's do that last line there. Line C Let's do the y-intercept\\nfirst. You see immediately the y-intercept--\\nwhen x is equal to 0, y is negative 2. So b is equal to negative 2. And then what is the slope? m is equal to change in\\ny over change in x. Let's start at that\\ny-intercept. If we go over to the right\\nby one, two, three, four. So our change in x\\nis equal to 4. What is our change in y? Our change in y is positive 2. So change in y is 2 when\\nchange in x is 4. So the slope is equal\\nto 1/2, 2/4. So the equation here is y is\\nequal to 1/2 x, that's our slope, minus 2. And we're done. Now let's go the other way. Let's look at some equations of\\nlines knowing that this is the slope and this is the\\ny-intercept-- that's the m, that's the b-- and actually\\ngraph them. Let's do this first line. I already started circling\\nit in orange. The y-intercept is 5. When x is equal to 0,\\ny is equal to 5. You can verify that\\non the equation. So when x is equal to 0, y is\\nequal to one, two, three, four, five. That's the y-intercept\\nand the slope is 2. That means when I move 1 in the\\nx-direction, I move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move 1 in the x-direction,\\nI move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move 1 in the x-direction,\\nI move up 2 in the y-direction. If I move back 1 in the\\nx-direction, I move down 2 in the y-direction. If I move back 1 in the\\nx-direction, I move down 2 in the y-direction. I keep doing that. So this line is going to look--\\nI can't draw lines too neatly, but this is going\\nto be my best shot. It's going to look something\\nlike that. It'll just keep going on,\\non and on and on. So that's our first line. I can just keep going\\ndown like that. Let's do this second line. y is equal to negative\\n0.2x plus 7. Let me write that. y is equal\\nto negative 0.2x plus 7. It's always easier to\\nthink in fractions. So 0.2 is the same\\nthing as 1/5. We could write y is equal to\\nnegative 1/5 x plus 7. We know it's y-intercept at 7. So it's one, two, three,\\nfour, five, six. That's our y-intercept\\nwhen x is equal to 0. This tells us that for every\\n5 we move to the right, we move down 1. We can view this as\\nnegative 1/5. The delta y over delta x is\\nequal to negative 1/5. For every 5 we move to the\\nright, we move down 1. So every 5. One, two, three, four, five. We moved 5 to the right. That means we must\\nmove down 1. We move 5 to the right. One, two, three, four, five. We must move down 1. If you go backwards, if you move\\n5 backwards-- instead of this, if you view this\\nas 1 over negative 5. These are obviously equivalent\\nnumbers. If you go back 5-- that's\\nnegative 5. One, two, three, four, five. Then you move up 1. If you go back 5-- one,\\ntwo, three, four, five-- you move up 1. So the line is going\\nto look like this. I have to just connect\\nthe dots. I think you get the idea. I just have to connect\\nthose dots. I could've drawn it a little\\nbit straighter. Now let's do this one, y\\nis equal to negative x. Where's the b term? I don't see any b term. You remember we're saying\\ny is equal to mx plus b. Where is the b? Well, the b is 0. You could view this as plus 0. Here is b is 0. When x is 0, y is 0. That's our y-intercept, right\\nthere at the origin. And then the slope-- once again\\nyou see a negative sign. You could view that as\\nnegative 1x plus 0. So slope is negative 1. When you move to the right by\\n1, when change in x is 1, change in y is negative 1. When you move up by 1 in x,\\nyou go down by 1 in y. Or if you go down by 1 in x,\\nyou're going to go up by 1 in y. x and y are going to\\nhave opposite signs. They go in opposite\\ndirections. So the line is going\\nto look like that. You could almost imagine it's\\nsplitting the second and fourth quadrants. Now I'll do one more. Let's do this last\\none right here. y is equal to 3.75. Now you're saying, gee,\\nwe're looking for y is equal to mx plus b. Where is this x term? It's completely gone. Well the reality here is, this\\ncould be rewritten as y is equal to 0x plus 3.75. Now it makes sense. The slope is 0. No matter how much we change\\nour x, y does not change. Delta y over delta\\nx is equal to 0. I don't care how much\\nyou change your x. Our y-intercept is 3.75. So 1, 2, 3.75 is right\\naround there. You want to get close. 3 3/4. As I change x, y will\\nnot change. y is always going to be 3.75. It's just going to be\\na horizontal line at y is equal to 3.75. Anyway, hopefully you\\nfound this useful. \"),\n",

And let me draw a line. And since our line here\\nhas a negative slope, I'll draw a downward\\nsloping line. So let's say our line\\nlooks something like that. So hopefully, we're a little\\nfamiliar with the slope already. The slope essentially\\ntells us, look, start at some point\\non the line, and go to some other point\\nof the line, measure how much you had to move in the\\nx direction, that is your run, and then measure\\nhow much you had to move in the y direction,\\nthat is your rise. And our slope is equal\\nto rise over run. And you can see over here,\\nwe'd be downward sloping. Because if you move in\\nthe positive x direction, we have to go down. If our run is positive,\\nour rise here is negative. So this would be a\\nnegative over a positive, it would give you\\na negative number. That makes sense, because\\nwe're downward sloping. The more we go down\\nin this situation, for every step we\\nmove to the right, the more downward\\nsloping will be, the more of a negative\\nslope we'll have. So that's slope right over here. The y-intercept just tells us\\nwhere we intercept the y-axis. So the y-intercept, this\\npoint right over here, this is where the line\\nintersects with the y-axis. This will be the\\npoint 0 comma b. And this actually just falls\\nstraight out of this equation. When x is equal to\\n0-- so let's evaluate this equation, when\\nx is equal to 0. y will be equal to\\nm times 0 plus b. Well, anything times 0 is 0. So y is equal to 0\\nplus b, or y will be equal to b, when\\nx is equal to 0. So this is the point 0 comma b. Now, they tell us what\\nthe slope of this line is.

So b, we could say-- we could\\ndo a couple-- our y-intercept is the point 0 comma 8, or we\\ncould say that b-- Remember, it's also 0 comma b. We could say b is equal to 8.

And you don't have to draw it to do this problem but it always help to visualize That is my y axis. And the first point is (-1,6) So (-1, 6). So negative 1 coma, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 6. So it's this point, rigth over there, it's (-1, 6). And the other point is (5, -4). So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And we go down 4, So 1, 2, 3, 4 So it's right over there. So the line connects them will looks something like this. Line will draw a rough approximation. I can draw a straighter than that. I will draw a dotted line maybe Easier do dotted line. So the line will looks something like that. So let's find its equation. So good place to start is we can find its slope. Remember, we want, we can find the equation y is equal to mx plus b. This is the slope-intercept form where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. We can first try to solve for m. We can find the slope of this line. So m, or the slope is the change in y over the change in x. Or, we can view it as the y value of our end point minus the y value of our starting point over the x-value of our end point minus the x-value of our starting point. Let me make that clear. So this is equal to change in y over change in x wich is the same thing as rise over run wich is the same thing as the y-value of your ending point minus the y-value of your starting point. This is the same exact thing as change in y and that over the x value of your ending point minus the x-value of your starting point This is the exact same thing as change in x. And you just have to pick one of these as the starting point and one as the ending point. So let's just make this over here our starting point and make that our ending point. So what is our change in y? So our change in y, to go we started at y is equal to six, we started at y is equal to 6. And we go down all the way to y is equal to negative 4 So this is rigth here, that is our change in y You can look at the graph and say, oh, if I start at 6 and I go to negative 4 I went down 10. or if you just want to use this formula here it will give you the same thing We finished at negative 4, we finished at negative 4 and from that we want to subtract, we want to subtract 6. This right here is y2, our ending y and this is our beginning y This is y1. So y2, negative 4 minus y1, 6. or negative 4 minus 6. That is equal to negative 10. And all it does is tell us the change in y you go from this point to that point We have to go down, our rise is negative we have to go down 10. That's where the negative 10 comes from. Now we just have to find our change in x. So we can look at this graph over here. We started at x is equal to negative 1 and we go all the way to x is equal to 5. So we started at x is equal to negative 1, and we go all the way to x is equal to 5. So it takes us one to go to zero and then five more. So are change in x is 6. You can look at that visually there or you can use this formula same exact idea, our ending x-value, our ending x-value is 5 and our starting x-value is negative 1. 5 minus negative 1. 5 minus negative 1 is the same thing as 5 plus 1. So it is 6. So our slope here is negative 10 over 6. wich is the exact same thing as negative 5 thirds. as negative 5 over 3 I divided the numerator and the denominator by 2. So we now know our equation will be y is equal to negative 5 thirds, that's our slope, x plus b. So we still need to solve for y-intercept to get our equation. And to do that, we can use the information that we know in fact we have several points of information We can use the fact that the line goes through the point (-1,6) you could use the other point as well. We know that when is equal to negative 1, So y is eqaul to 6. So y is equal to six when x is equal to negative 1 So negative 5 thirds times x, when x is equal to negative 1 y is equal to 6. So we literally just substitute this x and y value back into this and know we can solve for b. So let's see, this negative 1 times negative 5 thirds. So we have 6 is equal to positive five thirds plus b. And now we can subtract 5 thirds from both sides of this equation. so we have subtracted the left hand side. From the left handside and subtracted from the rigth handside And then we get, what's 6 minus 5 thirds. So that's going to be, let me do it over here We take a common denominator. So 6 is the same thing as Let's do it over here. So 6 minus 5 over 3 is the same thing as 6 is the same thing as 18 over 3 minus 5 over 3 6 is 18 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3. And then of course, these cancel out. So we get b is equal to 13 thirds. So we are done. We know We know the slope and we know the y-intercept. The equation of our line is y is equal to negative 5 thirds x plus our y-intercept which is 13 which is 13 over 3. And we can write these as mixed numbers. if it's easier to visualize. 13 over 3 is four and 1 thirds. So this y-intercept right over here. this y-intercept right over here. That's 0 coma 13 over 3 or 0 coma 4 and 1 thirds. And even with my very roughly drawn diagram it those looks like this. And the slope negative 5 thirds that's the same thing as negative 1 and 2 thirds. You can see here the slope is downward because the slope is negative. It's a little bit steeper than a slope of 1. It's not quite a negative 2. It's negative 1 and 2 thirds. if you write this as a negative, as a mixed number. So, hopefully, you found that entertaining. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Tara was\\nhiking up a mountain. She started her hike at an\\nelevation of 1,200 meters and ascended at a constant rate. After four hours, she reached\\nan elevation of 1,700 meters. Let y represent Tara's elevation\\nin meters after x hours. And they ask us, and this is from an exercise on Khan Academy, it says, complete the equation for the relationship between the elevation\\nand the number of hours. And if you're on Khan\\nAcademy, you would type it in, but we can do it by hand. So pause this video and\\nwork it out on some paper and let's see if we get to the same place. All right, now let's do this together. So first of all, they tell us that she's ascending at a constant rate. So that's a pretty good indication that we could describe her elevation based on the number of hours she travels with a linear equation. And we could even figure\\nout that constant rate. It says that she goes from 1,200 meters to 1,700 meters in four hours. So we could say her rate is going to be her change in elevation over a change in time. So her change in elevation is 1,700 meters minus 1,200 meters and she\\ndoes this over four hours. Over, her change in time is four hours. So her constant rate\\nin the numerator here, 1,700 minus 1,200 is 500 meters. She's able to go up 500\\nmeters in four hours. If we divide 500 by four, this is 125 meters per hour. And so we could use this now to think about what our equation would be. Our elevation y would be equal to, well, where is she starting? Well, it's starting at 1,200 meters. So she's starting at 1,200 meters. And then to that, we're going to add how much she climbs based on\\nhow many hours she's traveled. So it's going to be this rate, 125 meters per hour times the number of hours she has been hiking. So the number of hours is x times x. So this right over here is an equation for the relationship between the elevation and the number of hours. Another way you could\\nhave thought about it, you could have said, okay, this is going to be a linear equation because she's ascending\\nat a constant rate. You could say the slope intercept form for a linear equation is\\ny is equal to mx plus b, where b is your y-intercept. What is the value of y\\nwhen x is equal to zero? And you'd say, all right, when x is equal to zero, she's at an elevation of 1,200. And then m is our slope. So that's the rate at which\\nour elevation is increasing. And that's what we\\ncalculated right over here. Our slope is 125 meters per hour. So notice, these are equivalent. I just have, these two terms are swapped. So we could either write\\ny is equal to 1,200 plus 125x or you could write\\nit the other way around. You could write 125x plus 1,200. They are equivalent. \"),\n",

       "  \"So what I've drawn here\\nin yellow is a line. And let's say we know two\\nthings about this line. We know that it\\nhas a slope of m, and we know that the point\\na, b is on this line. And so the question that we're\\ngoing to try to answer is, can we easily come\\nup with an equation for this line using\\nthis information? Well, let's try it out. So any point on this line,\\nor any x, y on this line, would have to\\nsatisfy the condition that the slope\\nbetween that point-- so let's say that this\\nis some point x, y. It's an arbitrary\\npoint on the line-- the fact that it's\\non the line tells us that the slope between a, b\\nand x, y must be equal to m. So let's use that knowledge to\\nactually construct an equation. So what is the slope\\nbetween a, b and x, y? Well, our change in y--\\nremember slope is just change in y over change in x. Let me write that. Slope is equal to change\\nin y over change in x. This little triangle character,\\nthat's the Greek letter Delta, shorthand for change in. Our change in y--\\nwell let's see. If we start at y is equal\\nto b, and if we end up at y equals this arbitrary\\ny right over here, this change in y right over\\nhere is going to be y minus b. Let me write it in\\nthose same colors. So this is going to be y\\nminus my little orange b. And that's going to be\\nover our change in x. And the exact same logic--\\nwe start at x equals a. We finish at x\\nequals this arbitrary x, whatever x we\\nhappen to be at. So that change in x is\\ngoing to be that ending point minus our starting\\npoint-- minus a. And we know this is the slope\\nbetween these two points. That's the slope between\\nany two points on this line. And that's going\\nto be equal to m. So this is going\\nto be equal to m. And so what we've\\nalready done here is actually create an equation\\nthat describes this line. It might not be in any form\\nthat you're used to seeing, but this is an\\nequation that describes any x, y that satisfies this\\nequation right over here will be on the line because\\nany x, y that satisfies this, the slope between that x, y\\nand this point right over here, between the point a, b,\\nis going to be equal to m. So let's actually now\\nconvert this into forms that we might\\nrecognize more easily. So let me paste that. So to simplify this expression\\na little bit, or at least to get rid of the x minus\\na in the denominator, let's multiply both\\nsides by x minus a. So if we multiply both sides\\nby x minus a-- so x minus a on the left-hand side and\\nx minus a on the right. Let me put some\\nparentheses around it. So we're going to multiply\\nboth sides by x minus a. The whole point of that is you\\nhave x minus a divided by x minus a, which is just\\ngoing to be equal to 1. And then on the\\nright-hand side, you just have m times x minus a. So this whole thing\\nhas simplified to y minus b is equal\\nto m times x minus a. And right here, this is\\na form that people, that mathematicians, have\\ncategorized as point-slope form. So this right over here\\nis the point-slope form of the equation that\\ndescribes this line. Now, why is it called\\npoint-slope form? Well, it's very easy to\\ninspect this and say, OK. Well look, this is the\\nslope of the line in green. That's the slope of the line. And I can put the two points in. If the point a, b\\nis on this line, I'll have the slope times x\\nminus a is equal to y minus b. Now, let's see\\nwhy this is useful or why people like to\\nuse this type of thing. Let's not use just a, b\\nand a slope of m anymore. Let's make this a little\\nbit more concrete. Let's say that someone tells you\\nthat I'm dealing with some line where the slope is equal\\nto 2, and let's say it goes through the\\npoint negative 7, 5. So very quickly, you\\ncould use this information and your knowledge\\nof point-slope form to write this in this form. You would just say,\\nwell, an equation that contains this point and has this\\nslope would be y minus b, which is 5-- y minus the\\ny-coordinate of the point that this line contains--\\nis equal to my slope times x minus the x-coordinate\\nthat this line contains. So x minus negative 7. And just like that, we have\\nwritten an equation that has a slope of 2\\nand that contains this point right over here. And if we don't like the x minus\\nnegative 7 right over here, we could obviously\\nrewrite that as x plus 7. But this is kind of the\\npurest point-slope form. If you want to simplify\\nit a little bit, you could write it as y minus\\n5 is equal to 2 times x plus 7. And if you want to see that this\\nis just one way of expressing the equation of this line--\\nthere are many others, and the one that we're\\nmost familiar with is y-intercept form--\\nthis can easily be converted to\\ny-intercept form. To do that, we just have\\nto distribute this 2. So we get y minus 5 is equal\\nto 2 times x plus 2 times 7, so that's equal to 14. And then we can get rid of\\nthis negative 5 on the left by adding 5 to both\\nsides of this equation. And then we are left with,\\non the left-hand side, y and, on the right-hand\\nside, 2x plus 19. So this right over here\\nis slope-intercept form. You have your slope\\nand your y-intercept. So this is slope-intercept form. And this right up here\\nis point-slope form. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Let's say\\nwe have a linear equation and we know when X is equal to four that Y is equal to nine and we've plotted that\\npoint here on our XY plane. Actually, I forgot to label\\nthe x-axis right over there. Now let's say we also know, we also know that when X is equal to six Y is equal to one. And we've plotted that point there. And so this green line\\nrepresents all of the solutions to this linear equation. Now what I want to do in this video is I want to say, well can we\\nfind that linear equation and can we express it\\nin both point-slope form and in slope-intercept form. And I encourage you, like always, pause the video and see if you can do it. So let's first think\\nabout point-slope form. Point, point-slope form. And point-slope form is\\nvery easy to generate if you know a point on the line, or if you know a point that satisfies, where the X and Y coordinates\\nsatisfy the linear equation, and if you were to know\\nthe slope of the line that represents the solution\\nset of that linear equation. Now for sure we actually\\nwere given two points that are solutions, that represent solutions to the linear equation. To fully apply point-slope, or\\nto apply point-slope easily, we just have to figure out the slope. And what we could do is,\\nwe could just evaluate well what's the slope between\\nthe two points that we know? And we just have to remind\\nourselves that slope, slope, is equal to, slope is equal to change\\nin y over change in x. Sometimes people say rise over run. And what's that going to be? Well, if we say that this\\nsecond point right over here, if we say this is kind of our, if we're starting at this\\npoint and we go to that point, then our change in Y, going\\nfrom this point to that point is going to be, it's going to be equal to one minus, one minus nine. One minus nine. This point right over here\\nis the point six comma one. So we started at Y equals nine, we finish at Y equals one, our change in Y is going\\nto be one minus nine. We have a negative eight change in Y, which makes sense. We've gone down eight. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be\\nequal to negative eight. That's our change in Y. And what's our change in X? Well we go from X equals\\nfour to X equals six. So we end up at X equals six and we started at X equals four. We started at X equals four, so our change in X is six minus four, which is equal to two. Which is equal to two. And you could have even done it visually. To go from this point to\\nthis point your change in Y, your change in Y is you went down eight. So your change in, let me write this. So your change in Y is\\nequal to negative eight. And what was your change in X? Again to get to this point? Well, your change in X is positive two. So your change in X is equal to two. And so what's your slope? Change in Y over change in X. Negative eight over two\\nis equal to negative four. So now that we have a, now that we know the slope and we know a point, we know a, we actually know two points on the line, we can express this in point-slope form. And so let's do that. And the way I like to\\nit is I always like to just take it straight from the\\ndefinition of what slope is. We know that the slope between\\nany two points on this line is going to be negative four. So if we take an arbitrary\\nY that sits on this line and if we find the difference\\nbetween that Y and, let's focus on this point up here. So if we find the difference between that Y and this Y, and nine, and it's over the difference between some X on the line and this X, and four. This is going to be the slope\\nbetween any XY on this line and this point right over here. And the slope between\\nany two points on a line are going to have to be constant. So this is going to be equal\\nto the slope of the line. It's going to be equal to negative four. And we're not in point-slope form or classic point-slope form just yet. To do that, we just multiply\\nboth sides times X minus four. So we get Y minus 9, we get Y minus nine is equal to our slope, negative four times X minus four. Time X minus four. And this right over here is our classic, this right over here is our\\nclassic point-slope form. We have the point, sometimes they even put\\nparenthesis like this, but we could figure out the point from this point-slope form. The point that sits on\\nthis line with things that make both sides of\\nthis equation equal to zero. So it would be X equals\\nfour, Y equals nine, which we have right up there, and then the slope is right over here, it's negative four. Now from this can we now express this linear equation in y-intercept form? And y-intercept form, just\\nas a bit of a reminder, it's Y is equal to MX plus B. Where this coefficient is our slope and this constant right over here allows us to figure out our y-intercept. And to get this in this\\nform we just have to simplify a little bit of this algebra. So you have Y minus nine. Y minus nine is equal to, well let's distribute this negative four. And I'll just switch some colors. Let's distribute this negative four. Negative four times X is negative four X. Negative four time\\nnegative four is plus 16. And now, if we just want to isolate the Y on the left hand side, we can add nine to both sides. So let's do that. Let's add nine, let's add nine to both sides. Let's add nine to both sides. On the left-hand side\\nwe're just left with Y. And on the right-hand side we're left with negative four X and then\\n16 plus nine is plus 25. And there you have it. We have the same linear\\nequation, but it's now represented in slope-intercept form. Once again, we see the\\nslope right over here and now we can figure out\\nwhat the y-intercept is. The y-intercept when X is equal to zero, Y is going to be equal to 25. My axis right here, I\\nhaven't drawn it high enough, but if I made it even taller\\nand taller and you see this line is gonna intersect the y-axis when Y is equal to, Y is equal to 25. So there you go, we wrote\\nit in point-slope form, that is that right over there, and we wrote it in Y, sorry, we wrote it in slope, we wrote it in slope-intercept form. Point-slope and slope-intercept. Hopefully you enjoyed that. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Voiceover] We\\'ve already\\nlooked at several ways of writing linear equations. You could write it in\\nslope-intercept form, where it would be of the form\\nof Y is equal to MX plus B, where M and B are constants. M is the coefficient on\\nthis MX term right over here and M would represent the slope. And then from B you\\'re able to figure out the y-intercept. The Y, you\\'re able to figure out\\nthe y-intercept from this. Literally the graph that\\nrepresents the XY pairs that satisfy this equation, it would intersect the y-axis at the point X equals zero, Y is equal to B. And it\\'s slope would be M. We\\'ve already seen that multiple times. We\\'ve also seen that you can also express things in point-slope form. So let me make it clear. This is slope-intercept. Slope- intercept. And these are just different ways of writing the same equations. You can algebraically manipulate\\nfrom one to the other. Another way is point-slope. Point-slope form. And in point-slope form,\\nif you know that some, if you know that there\\'s\\nan equation where the line that represents the\\nsolutions of that equation has a slope M. Slope is equal to M. And if you know that X equals, X equals A, Y equals B, satisfies that equation, then in point-slope form you\\ncan express the equation as Y minus B is equal to M times X minus A. This is point-slope form\\nand we do videos on that. But what I really want\\nto get into in this video is another form. And it\\'s a form that you\\nmight have already seen. And that is standard form. Standard. Standard form. And standard form takes the shape of AX plus BY is equal to C, where A, B, and C are integers. And what I want to do in this video, like we\\'ve done in the ones on point-slope and slope-intercept is get an appreciation for what is standard form good at and what is standard form less good at? So let\\'s give a tangible example here. So let\\'s say I have the linear equation, it\\'s in standard form, 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72. And we wanted to graph this. So the thing that standard\\nform is really good for is figuring out, not just the y-intercept, y-intercept is pretty good if you\\'re using slope-intercept form, but we can find out the\\ny-intercept pretty clearly from standard form and the x-intercept. The x-intercept isn\\'t\\nso easy to figure out from these other forms right over here. So how do we do that? Well to figure out the x and y-intercepts, let\\'s just set up a little table here, X comma Y, and so the x-intercept is going to happen when Y is equal to zero. And the y-intercept is going to happen when X is equal to zero. So when Y is zero, what is X? So when Y is zero, 16 times zero is zero, that term disappears, and you\\'re left with 9X is equal to 72. So if nine times X is 72, 72 divided by nine is eight. So X would be equal to eight. So once again, that was\\npretty easy to figure out. This term goes away and\\nyou just have to say hey, nine times X is 72, X would be eight. When Y is equal to zero, X is eight. So the point, let\\'s see, Y is zero, X is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. That\\'s this point, that right over here. This point right over\\nhere is the x-intercept. When we talk about x-intercepts\\nwe\\'re referring to the point where the line actually\\nintersects the x-axis. Now what about the y-intercept? Well, we said X equals\\nzero, this disappears. And we\\'re left with 16Y is equal to 72. And so we could solve, we could solve that. So we could say, alright\\n16Y is equal to 72. And then divide both sides by 16. We get Y is equal to 72 over 16. And let\\'s see, what is that equal to? That is equal to, let\\'s see, they\\'re both divisible by eight, so that\\'s nine over two. Or we could say it\\'s 4.5. So when X is zero, Y is 4.5. And so, we could plot that point as well. X is zero, Y is one, two, three, 4.5. And just with these two\\npoints, two points are enough to graph a line, we can now graph it. So let\\'s do that. So let me, oops, though I was using the tool that would draw a straight line. Let me see if I can... So the line will look something like that. There you have it. I\\'ve just graphed, I\\'ve just graphed, this is the line that represents\\nall the X and Y pairs that satisfy the equation 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72. Now, I mentioned standard\\nform\\'s good at certain things and the good thing that standard form is, where it\\'s maybe somewhat unique relative to the other forms we looked at, is it\\'s very easy to\\nfigure out the x-intercept. It was very easy to\\nfigure out the x-intercept from standard form. And it wasn\\'t too hard to figure\\nout the y-intercept either. If we looked at slope-intercept form, the y-intercept just\\nkinda jumps out at you. At point-slope form, neither\\nthe x nor the y-intercept kind of jump out at you. The place where slope-intercept\\nor point-slope form are frankly better is\\nthat it\\'s pretty easy to pick out the slope here, while in standard form you would have to do a little bit of work. You could use these two points, you could use the x and y-intercepts as two points and figure\\nout the slope from there. So you can literally say,\\n\"Okay, if I\\'m going from \"this point to this point, my change in X \"to go from eight to\\nzero is negative eight. \"And to go from zero to 4.5,\" I wrote that little delta\\nthere unnecessarily. Let me. So when you go from eight to zero, your change in X is\\nequal to negative eight. And to go from zero to 4.5, your change in Y is going to be 4.5. So your slope, once you\\'ve figured this out, you could say, \"Okay, this is going to be \"change in Y, 4.5, over change in X, \"over negative 8.\" And since I, at least I\\ndon\\'t like a decimal up here, let\\'s multiply the numerator\\nand the denominator by two. You get negative nine over 16. Now once again, we had to do\\na little bit of work here. We either use these two points, it didn\\'t just jump\\nimmediately out of this, although you might see a\\nlittle bit of a pattern of what\\'s going on here. But you still have to think about is it negative? Is it positive? You have to do a little bit\\nof algebraic manipulation. Or, what I typically do if\\nI\\'m looking for the slope, I actually might put this into, into one of the other forms. Especially slope-intercept form. But standard form by itself, great for figuring out\\nboth the x and y-intercepts and it\\'s frankly not that\\nhard to convert it to slope-intercept form. Let\\'s do that just to make it clear. So if you start with 9X, let me do that in yellow. If we start with 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72 and we want to put it\\nin slope-intercept form, we can subtract 9X from both sides. You get 16Y is equal to\\nnegative 9X, plus 72. And then divide both sides by 16. So divide everthing by 16. And you\\'ll be left with Y is equal to negative 9/16X, that\\'s the slope, you see it right there, plus 72 over 16, we already figured out that\\'s 9/2 or 4.5. So I could write, oh I\\'ll\\njust write that as 4.5. And this form over here, much\\neasier to figure out the slope and, actually, the\\ny-intercept jumps out at you. But the x-intercept isn\\'t as obvious. '),\n",

So the line is\\nessentially the set of all coordinate,\\nall x's and y's, that satisfy this relationship\\nright over here. To make things simpler,\\nwhat we're going to do is set up a table\\nwhere we're going to put a bunch of x values\\nin and then figure out the corresponding y value\\nbased on this relationship. But to make it a\\nlittle bit simpler, I'm going to solve for y here. So it becomes easier to\\nsolve for y for any given x. So we have 5x plus\\n2y is equal to 20. If we want to solve\\nfor y, let's just get rid of the 5x on\\nthe left-hand side. So let's subtract 5x from\\nboth sides of this equation. The left-hand side,\\nthese guys cancel out, so we get 2y is equal\\nto the right hand side, you have 20 minus 5x. And then you can divide both\\nsides of this equation by 2. So you divide both sides by 2. The left-hand side, we\\njust have a y, and then the right-hand side, we\\ncould leave it that way. That actually would be a\\npretty straightforward way to leave it, or we could\\ncall this 20 divided by 2 is 10 minus 5x over 2\\nor minus 5/2 times x. And so now using\\nthis, let's just come up with a bunch\\nof x values and see what the corresponding y values\\nare, and then just plot them. So let me do this\\nin a new color. So let me-- a slightly\\ndifferent shade of yellow. So we have x values,\\nand then let's think about what\\nthe corresponding y value is going to be. So I'll start, well, I\\ncould start anywhere. I'll start at x is equal\\nto 0, just because that tends to keep things\\npretty simple. If x is 0, then y is equal\\nto 10 minus 5/2 times 0, which is equal to\\n5/2 times 0 is just a 0. So it's just 10 minus 0 or 10. So that gives us the coordinate,\\nthe point, 0 comma 10. When x is 0, y is 10. So x is 0. So it's going to be right here\\nat the middle of the x-axis. And you go up 10 for\\nthe y-coordinate. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. So it's right over here. So that's the point 0 comma 10. Let's do another point. Let's say that x is 2. I'm going to pick\\nmultiples of 2 here just so that I get a\\nnice clean answer here. So when x is 2, then y is\\nequal to 10 minus 5/2 times 2, and the 2 in the\\ndenominator cancels out with this 2 in the numerator. So it simplifies to\\n10 minus 5, or just 5. So that tells us the point\\nx equals 2, y is equal to 5, is on the line. So 2x is equal to 1,\\n2 right over here. And then y is equal to 5. You go up 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, just like that. So that's the point 2, 5. And when you're drawing\\na line you actually just need two points. If you have a ruler or\\nany kind of straight edge, we could just connect\\nthese two points. And if we do it neatly,\\nevery point on that line should satisfy this\\nrelationship right here. Just so we get practice,\\nI'll do more points. So let me do, let's say\\nwhen x is equal to 4, then y is equal to\\n10 minus 5/2 times 4. This is equal to 5/2 times 4. This is equal to 10, right? Because the 2, divide the\\ndenominator by 2 you get 1, divide the numerator by\\n2 you get 2, or 4 over 2 is the same thing as 2. So it becomes 2 times 5\\nis 10, 10 minus 10 is 0. So the point 4 comma\\n0 is on our line. So x is 1, 2, 3,\\n4, and then y is 0. So we don't move up at\\nall, so we have 4 comma 0. And I could keep going. I could try other points. You could do them if you\\nlike, but this is plenty. Just two of these would have\\nbeen enough to draw the line. So let me just draw it. So I'll do it in white. So the line will look\\nsomething like this. And I could keep going\\nin both directions. So there you have it. That is the graph of\\nour linear equation.

       "  \"- [Instructor] We've talked about the idea of standard form of a linear\\nequation in other videos, and the point of this video\\nis to clarify something and resolve some differences\\nthat you might see in different classes in terms\\nof what standard form is. So everyone agrees that standard form is generally a linear equation where you have some number times x plus some number times y\\nis equal to some number. So things that are in\\nstandard form would include things like three x plus\\nfour y is equal to 10, or two x plus five y is equal to negative 10. Everyone would agree that\\nthese are standard form, and everyone would\\nagree that the following are not standard form. So if I were to write three x is equal to negative four y plus 10. Even though these are\\nequivalent equations, this is just not in standard form. Similarly, if I wrote that y is equal to three times x plus seven, this\\nis also not in standard form. Now the place where some\\npeople might disagree is if you were to see something like six x plus eight y is equal to 20. Now why would some folks argue that this is not standard form? Well, for some folks, they\\nwould say standard form, the coefficients on x and\\ny and our constant term, so our A, B and C, can't\\nshare any common factors. Here, six, eight and 20,\\nthey're all divisible by two, so some folks would argue that\\nthis is not standard form, and to get it into standard form, you would divide all of these by two, and if you did, you would\\nget this equation here. Now that's useful because\\nthen you only have one unique equation, but on Khan Academy, we do not restrict in that way, and that is also a very popular\\nway of thinking about it. We just want you to think\\nabout it in this form, Ax plus By is equal to C. When you do the exercises\\non the Khan Academy, it's not going to be checking\\nwhether these coefficients, A, B and C are divisible,\\nhave a common factor. So for Khan Academy purposes, this is considered standard form, although don't be surprised\\nif you encounter some folks who say, no, we would rather\\nyou remove any common factors. Now another example\\nwould be something like negative three x minus four\\ny is equal to negative 10. So some folks would argue\\nthat this is not standard form because they want to see\\nthis first coefficient right over here, the A,\\nbeing greater than zero, while here it is less than zero. For our purposes on Khan Academy, we do consider this standard form, but I'm just letting you know, because some folks might not because this leading coefficient\\nis not greater than zero. Now another example that\\nsome people might be on the edge with would be something like 1.25 x plus 5.50 y is equal to 10.5. The reason why some people\\nmight not consider this standard form is that A,\\nB and C are not integers. Some folks would say\\nto be in standard form, A, B and C need to be integers, and you could multiply\\nboth sides of the equation by some value that will give\\nyou integers for A, B, and C, but for Khan Academy purposes, we do consider this to\\nbe in standard form. We think this is important, actually not just being\\nable to have non-integers as A, B or C, but also being able to have a negative A, right over there, because negative three is our A, and also having coefficients,\\nhaving our As, Bs and Cs having shared factors, we\\nthing all of that's important because sometimes the\\nequation itself has meaning when you write it that way. We'll see that when we\\ndo some word problems, when we actually go into some real life and we try to construct equations, and based on the\\ninformation in the equation, it's easier to understand\\nif you keep it in this form. So for Khan Academy purposes,\\nthis is all standard form, but it's good to be aware\\nin your mathematical lives that some folks might want\\nto see the restriction of no common factor between A, B and C, that A is greater than zero, and that A, B and C\\nneed to all be integers, but Khan Academy does\\nnot hold you to that. \"),\n",

       "  \"- Rewrite Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7 in standard form. The equation must be simplified, which means all numbers must be integers that do not share a common\\nfactor other than one. Alright, we'll worry about this\\nsecond part in a little bit. Let's see if we can rewrite this. So it's Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. Let me get my scratch pad out. So it's Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. So the way that it's written right now, this is slope intercept form. It's written in the form Y is equal to mx plus b, where m in this case is 2/3 and b is 4/7. It's very easy to figure\\nout what the slope and what the Y intercept\\nis from this equation. But we wanna write this in standard form. Which would be the form Ax plus By is equal to C. And that extra text they were saying, the equation must be simplified. Which means all numbers must be integers that do not share a common\\nfactor other than one. That just means that A, B,\\nand C in the standard form they want need to be integers. And they want them to not\\nhave any common factors. So if we got to the point of say 4x plus 2y is equal to 10, well this number, and this\\nnumber, and this number are all divisible by two. They all have the common factor of two. So we would want to simplify it more. Divide them all by two\\nand then you would get two so you divide this by two. You get 2x, divide this by two you'll get plus y is equal to 5. So this is the form\\nthat they're asking for and probably because it's just easier for the site to know that\\nthis is the right answer. Because there's obviously a\\nbunch of forms in this way. So let's see if we can do that. Let's see if we can write\\nit in standard form. So the first thing I would wanna do is, well there's a bunch of ways\\nthat you could approach it. The first thing you could try to do is well let's get rid of\\nall of these fractions. And the best way to get\\nrid of the fractions is to multiple by three\\nand to multiply by seven. If you multiply by three you\\nget rid of this fraction. If you multiply by seven you\\nget rid of this fraction. So if you multiply three\\nand you multiply by seven. Let me just rewrite it over here. There's actually also a couple\\nof ways that we can do this. So if you multiply. So one way to do it. So we start with Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. So if I multiply this side by\\nthree and I multiply by seven, I have to do that to this side as well. So this is going to be multiplied by three and multiplied by seven. So the left hand side becomes 21y. 21y. Three times seven of course is\\n21, we just figured that out. We would distribute the 21. 21 times 2/3, well let's see. 21 divided by three is\\nseven, times two is 14. So it's gonna be 14x. And then 21 divided by seven\\nis three times four is 12. So just like that I was able\\nto get rid of the fractions. And now I wanna get all the X's and Y's on one side. So I wanna get this\\n14x onto the left side. So let's see if I can do that. So I'm gonna do that by. To get rid of this I would\\nwant to subtract 14x. I can't just do it on the right hand side I have to do it on the\\nleft hand side as well. So I wanna subtract 14x, and\\nthen what am I left with? Let me give myself a\\nlittle bit more space. So on the left hand side I have negative 14x plus 21y. Plus 21y is equal to. Let's see and I subtracted\\n14x to get rid of this. And then I have this is equal to 12. Now let's see, am I done? Do these share any, do 14, 21, and 12 share any common factors? Let's see, 14 is divisible\\nby two and seven. 21 is divisible by three and seven. 12 is divisible by two, six, three, four. But all of these aren't\\ndivisible by the same number. 14, let's see. 14 is divisible two,\\nso is 12, but 21 isn't. 14 is divisible by seven,\\nso is 21, but 12 isn't. And 21 and 12 are divisible\\nby three but 14 isn't. So I think this is about as\\nsimplified as I could get. If there was a common factor\\nfor all three of these numbers then I would divide all\\nof them the way I did in that previous example. But that's not the case right over here. So it's negative 14x\\nplus 21y is equal to 12. So let me see if I can\\nremember that and type that in. So it is, negative 14x plus 21y is equal to 12. Now let's see if I got it right.

For example, if I can manipulate that equation to be in the form Y is equal to MX plus B, well then I know that this M here, the\\ncoefficient on the X term, well that's going to be my slope. And B is going to be my Y intercept, we cover that in many other videos. Another option is to get\\ninto point-slope form. So the general framework\\nor the general template for point-slope form is,\\nif I have an equation of the form Y minus Y1\\nis equal to M times X minus X1, well then I immediately know that the line that this equation describes is going to have a slope of M once again. And here the Y intercept\\ndoesn't jump out at you. Let me make sure you\\ncan read this over here. The Y intercept doesn't jump out at you, but you know a point that is on this line. In particular, you know\\nthat the point X1, Y1 is going to be on this line. X1, Y1. So let's look at our original example. So it might immediately jump out at you that this is actually\\nin point-slope form. You might say, well okay, I see I have a minus X1, so X1 would be three, I have my slope here and\\nthat answers our question, our slope would be negative two. But here it says plus two,\\nI have to subtract a Y1. Well, you could just rewrite this, so it says, so you have\\nY minus negative two is equal to negative\\ntwo times X minus three, and then you see it's exactly this point-slope form right over here. So our slope right over\\nthere is negative two, and then if I were to ask you, well give me a point\\nthat sits on this line, you could say, alright,\\nan X1 would be three, and a Y1 would be negative two. This point sits on the line,\\nit's not the Y intercept, but it's a point on the line and we know the slope is negative two. Now another way to approach this is to just manipulate it so that we get into slope-intercept form. So let's do that, let's manipulate it so we get into slope-intercept form. So the first thing my brain wants to do is distribute this negative two, and if I do that, I get Y plus two is equal to negative 2x, negative two times negative three, plus six. And then I can subtract\\ntwo from both sides, and then I get Y is equal\\nto negative 2x plus four. And so here I am in\\nslope Y intercept form, and once again, I could\\nsay, alright my M here, the coefficient on the\\nX term, is my slope. So my slope is negative two. Let's do another example. So here, this equation\\ndoesn't immediately go into either one of these\\nforms, so let's manipulate it. And if it's in either one of them, I like to get into slope Y intercept form, it's a little bit easier\\nfor my brain to understand. So let's do that. So let us collect, well let's get the Xs, let's just isolate the Y\\non the right-hand side, since the 2y is already there. So let's add three to both sides. I'm just trying to get rid\\nof this negative three. So if we add three to both sides, on the left-hand side we\\nhave negative 4x plus 10 is equal to 2y, these cancel out. That was the whole point. And now to solve for Y, we just have to divide both sides by two. So if we divide everything by two, we get negative 2x plus\\nfive is equal to Y. So this is in slope-intercept form. I just have the Y on the\\nright-hand side instead of the left-hand side. We have Y is equal to mx plus B, and so our M is the coefficient on the X term right over here. So our slope is once\\nagain, is negative two, and here our Y intercept is five, in case we wanted to know it. Let's do one more\\nexample, one more example. Alright, so once again, this\\nis in neither slope-intercept or point-slope form to begin with, so let's just try to get\\nit to slope-intercept form. And like always, pause the video, and see if you can figure it out yourself. Alright, so let's get all the Ys on the left-hand side isolated, and the Xs on the right-hand side. So let me get rid of this negative 3x. So I'm gonna add 3x to both sides, and let's get rid of\\nthis 3y right over here. So let's subtract 3y from both sides. You couldn't do this, I'm\\ndoing two steps at once, but once again, I'm trying to get rid of this 3x, so I'm trying to get rid of this negative 3x, so I add 3x to the left, but I have\\nto do it to the right if I want to maintain the equality. And if I want to get rid of this 3y, well I subtract 3y from here, but I have to do it on the left-hand side if I want to maintain the equality. So what do I get? That cancels out, 5y minus 3y is 2y, is equal to 2x plus 3x is 5x, and then these two characters cancel out. And so if I want to solve for Y, I just divide both\\nsides by two and I get Y is equal to five halves X, and I'm done. And you mights say wait,\\nif this doesn't look exactly like slope-intercept form, where is my B? Well your B, if you wanted to see it, you could just write plus zero, B is implicitly zero right over here. So your slope, your slope is going to be the coefficient on the X term, it's going to be five halves. And if you want to know your Y intercept, well it's zero, when X is zero, Y is zero. \"),\n",

       "  \"A line passes through the points\\nnegative 3, 6 and 6, 0. Find the equation of this line\\nin point slope form, slope intercept form, standard form. And the way to think about\\nthese, these are just three different ways of writing\\nthe same equation. So if you give me one of them,\\nwe can manipulate it to get any of the other ones. But just so you know what these\\nare, point slope form, let's say the point x1, y1 are,\\nlet's say that that is a point on the line. And when someone puts this\\nlittle subscript here, so if they just write an x, that means\\nwe're talking about a variable that can take\\non any value. If someone writes x with a\\nsubscript 1 and a y with a subscript 1, that's like saying\\na particular value x and a particular value of y,\\nor a particular coordinate. And you'll see that when\\nwe do the example. But point slope form says\\nthat, look, if I know a particular point, and if I know\\nthe slope of the line, then putting that line in point\\nslope form would be y minus y1 is equal to\\nm times x minus x1. So, for example, and we'll do\\nthat in this video, if the point negative 3 comma 6 is on\\nthe line, then we'd say y minus 6 is equal to m times x\\nminus negative 3, so it'll end up becoming x plus 3. So this is a particular\\nx, and a particular y. It could be a negative\\n3 and 6. So that's point slope form. Slope intercept form is y is\\nequal to mx plus b, where once again m is the slope, b is the\\ny-intercept-- where does the line intersect the y-axis--\\nwhat value does y take on when x is 0? And then standard form is the\\nform ax plus by is equal to c, where these are just two\\nnumbers, essentially. They really don't have\\nany interpretation directly on the graph. So let's do this, let's figure\\nout all of these forms. So the first thing we want to do\\nis figure out the slope. Once we figure out the slope,\\nthen point slope form is actually very, very, very\\nstraightforward to calculate. So, just to remind ourselves,\\nslope, which is equal to m, which is going to be equal to\\nthe change in y over the change in x. Now what is the change in y? If we view this as our end\\npoint, if we imagine that we are going from here to\\nthat point, what is the change in y? Well, we have our end point,\\nwhich is 0, y ends up at the 0, and y was at 6. So, our finishing y point is 0,\\nour starting y point is 6. What was our finishing x\\npoint, or x-coordinate? Our finishing x-coordinate\\nwas 6. Let me make this very clear, I\\ndon't want to confuse you. So this 0, we have that 0, that\\nis that 0 right there. And then we have this 6, which\\nwas our starting y point, that is that 6 right there. And then we want our finishing x\\nvalue-- that is that 6 right there, or that 6 right there--\\nand we want to subtract from that our starting x value. Well, our starting x value is\\nthat right over there, that's that negative 3. And just to make sure we know\\nwhat we're doing, this negative 3 is that negative\\n3, right there. I'm just saying, if we go from\\nthat point to that point, our y went down by 6, right? We went from 6 to 0. Our y went down by 6. So we get 0 minus\\n6 is negative 6. That makes sense. Y went down by 6. And, if we went from that point\\nto that point, what happened to x? We went from negative 3 to\\n6, it should go up by 9. And if you calculate this, take\\nyour 6 minus negative 3, that's the same thing as\\n6 plus 3, that is 9. And what is negative 6/9? Well, if you simplify it,\\nit is negative 2/3. You divide the numerator and\\nthe denominator by 3. So that is our slope,\\nnegative 2/3. So we're pretty much ready\\nto use point slope form. We have a point, we could pick\\none of these points, I'll just go with the negative 3, 6. And we have our slope. So let's put it in\\npoint slope form. All we have to do is we say y\\nminus-- now we could have taken either of these points,\\nI'll take this one-- so y minus the y value over here, so\\ny minus 6 is equal to our slope, which is negative\\n2/3 times x minus our x-coordinate. Well, our x-coordinate, so x\\nminus our x-coordinate is negative 3, x minus negative\\n3, and we're done. We can simplify it\\na little bit. This becomes y minus 6 is equal\\nto negative 2/3 times x. x minus negative 3 is the\\nsame thing as x plus 3. This is our point slope form. Now, we can literally just\\nalgebraically manipulate this guy right here to put it into\\nour slope intercept form. Let's do that. So let's do slope intercept\\nin orange. So we have slope intercept. So what can we do here\\nto simplify this? Well, we can multiply out the\\nnegative 2/3, so you get y minus 6 is equal to-- I'm just\\ndistributing the negative 2/3-- so negative 2/3 times\\nx is negative 2/3 x. And then negative 2/3 times\\n3 is negative 2. And now to get it in slope\\nintercept form, we just have to add the 6 to both sides so\\nwe get rid of it on the left-hand side, so let's\\nadd 6 to both sides of this equation. Left-hand side of the equation,\\nwe're just left with a y, these guys cancel out. You get a y is equal\\nto negative 2/3 x. Negative 2 plus 6 is plus 4. So there you have it, that is\\nour slope intercept form, mx plus b, that's our\\ny-intercept. Now the last thing we need\\nto do is get it into the standard form. So once again, we just have to\\nalgebraically manipulate it so that the x's and the\\ny's are both on this side of the equation. So let's just add 2/3 x to both\\nsides of this equation. So I'll start it here. So we have y is equal to\\nnegative 2/3 x plus 4, that's slope intercept form. Let's added 2/3 x, so\\nplus 2/3 x to both sides of this equation. I'm doing that so it I don't\\nhave this 2/3 x on the right-hand side, this\\nnegative 2/3 x. So the left-hand side of the\\nequation-- I scrunched it up a little bit, maybe more than I\\nshould have-- the left-hand side of this equation is what? It is 2/3 x, because 2 over\\n3x, plus this y, that's my left-hand side, is equal to--\\nthese guys cancel out-- is equal to 4. So this, by itself, we are in\\nstandard form, this is the standard form of the equation. If we want it to look, make it\\nlook extra clean and have no fractions here, we could\\nmultiply both sides of this equation by 3. If we do that, what do we get? 2/3 x times 3 is just 2x. y times 3 is 3y. And then 4 times 3 is 12. These are the same equations,\\nI just multiplied every term by 3. If you do it to the left-hand\\nside, you can do to the right-hand side-- or you have to\\ndo to the right-hand side-- and we are in standard form. \"),\n",

But to get there, you\\nhave to cross this river. You can't swim across it. It's a very rough river. So you have to\\ncross this bridge. And so as you approach the\\nbridge, this troll shows up. That's the troll. And he says, well, I'm\\na reasonable troll. You just have to pay $5. And when you look a\\nlittle bit more carefully, you see that there\\nactually was a sign there that says $5 toll\\nto cross the bridge. Now, unfortunately\\nfor you, you do not have any money in your pocket. And so the troll says,\\nwell, you can't cross. But you say, I need to really,\\nreally get to that castle. And so the troll says, well,\\nI'll take some pity on you. Instead of paying the $5,\\nI will give you a riddle. And the riddle is this. And now, I'm speaking\\nas the troll. I am a rich troll\\nbecause I get to charge from everyone who\\ncrosses the bridge. And actually, I only\\naccept $5 or $10 bills. It's a bit of a\\nriddle why they accept American currency in\\nthis fantasy land. But let's just take\\nthat as a given for now. So I only take $5 or $10 bills. I'm being the troll. Obviously, if you give me a\\n$10, I'll give you $5 back. And I know, because I count\\nmy money on a daily basis. I like to save my\\nmoney as the troll. I know that I have a\\ntotal of 900 bills. So let me write that down. I have a total of 900 bills, a\\ntotal of 900 $5 and $10 bills. And he says, because\\nI'm very sympathetic, I'll give you another\\npiece of information. He says, if you were to\\nadd up the value of all of my money, which is all in\\n$5 and $10 bills that I have, I, speaking as the troll about\\ndollars bills, is $5,500. This is a rich troll. And so the riddle\\nis-- exactly, exactly. And if you give the wrong\\nanswer and if you're not able to solve it\\nin 10 minutes, he's just going to push\\nyou into the river or do something horrible to you. He says, exactly how many 5's\\nand 10's do I, the troll, have? So the first thing I'm going\\nto have you think about is, is this even a\\nsolvable problem? Because if it's not\\na solvable problem, you should probably\\nrun as fast as you can in the other direction. So now, I will tell you, yes,\\nit is a solvable problem. And let's start thinking about\\nit a little bit algebraically. And to do that, let's\\njust set some variables. And I will set the\\nvariables to be what we're really\\ntrying to solve for. We're trying to solve for the\\nnumber of $5 bills we have and the number of $10\\nbills that we have. So let's just define\\nsome variables. I'll say f for 5. Let's let f equal the number\\nof $5 bills that we have. And I'll use the same idea. Let's let t is equal to the\\nnumber $10 bills that we have. Now, given this\\ninformation, and now I'm not sure if I'm\\nspeaking as-- well, let's say I'm still\\nspeaking as the troll. I'm a very sympathetic\\ntroll, and I'm going to give you hints. Given this information and\\nsetting these variables in this way, can I represent\\nthe clues in the riddle mathematically? So let's focus on\\nthe first clue. Can I represent this clue that\\nthe total of 900 $5 and $10 bills, or can I represent\\nthat mathematically, that I have a total of\\n900 $5 and $10 bills? Well, what's going to\\nbe our total of bills? It's going to be the number of\\n5's that we have, which is f. The number of 5's\\nthat we have is f. And then the number of\\n10s that we have is t. The total number of 5's\\nplus the total number of 10s, that's our\\ntotal number of bills. So that's going to\\nbe equal to 900. So this statement, this\\nfirst clue in our riddle, can be written\\nmathematically like this if we defined the\\nvariables like that. And I just said f for 5,\\nbecause f for 5 in t for 10. Now, let's look at\\nthe second clue. Can we represent this\\none mathematically given these variable definitions\\nthat we created? Well, let's think separately\\nabout the value of the $5 bills and the value of the $10 bills. What's the value of\\nall of the $5 bills? Well, each $5 bill is worth $5. So it's going to be 5 times\\nthe number of $5 bills that we have. So if I have one $5\\nbill, it will be $5. If I have 100 $5 bills,\\nthen it's going to be $500. How ever many $5 bills,\\nI just multiply it by 5. That's the value\\nof the $5 bills. Let me write that down. Value of the $5 bills. Now, same logic. What's the value\\nof the $10 bills? Well, the value of\\nthe $10 bills is just going to be 10 times\\nhowever many bills I have-- value of the $10 bills. So what's going to be the\\ntotal value of my bills? Well, it's going to be\\nthe value of the $5 bills plus the value of the $10 bills? And he tells me what\\nthat total value is. It's $5,500. So if I add these\\ntwo things, they're going to add up to be $5,500. So this second statement we\\ncan represent mathematically with this second\\nequation right over here. And what we essentially\\nhave right over here, we have two equations. Each of them have two unknowns. And just using one\\nof these equations, we can't really figure\\nout what f and t are. You can pick a bunch of\\ndifferent combinations that add up to 900 here. You could pick a bunch of\\ndifferent combinations, where if you work out all the\\nmath, you get $5,500. So independently,\\nthese equations, you don't know what f and t are. But what we will see over\\nthe next several videos is that if you use both of\\nthis information, if you say that there's\\nan f and a t that has to satisfy both\\nof these equations, then you can find a solution. And this is called a\\nsystem of equations. Let me write that down--\\nsystem of equations. \"),\n",

But we had to cross the\\nbridge and the troll gave us these clues because\\nwe had no money in our pocket. And if we don't\\nsolve his riddle, he's going to push\\nus into the water. So we are under pressure. And at least we made some\\nheadway in the last video. We were able to represent\\nhis clues mathematically as a system of equations. What I want to do in\\nthis video is think about whether we can solve for\\nthis system of equations. And you'll see that\\nthere are many ways of solving a system\\nof equations. But this time I want\\nto do it visually. Because at least in my\\nmind, it helps really get the intuition of what\\nthese things are saying. So let's draw some\\naxes over here. Let's draw an f-axis. That's the number of\\nfives that I have. And let's draw a t-axis. That is the number\\nof tens I have. And let's say that this\\nright over here is 500 tens. That is 1,000 tens. And let's say this is-- oh,\\nsorry, that's 500 fives. That's 1,000 fives. This is 500 tens, And\\nthis is 1,000 tens. So let's think about all of\\nthe combinations of f's and t's that satisfy this\\nfirst equation. If we have no tens, then\\nwe're going to have 900 fives. So that looks like\\nit's right about there. So that's the point\\n0 tens, 900 fives. But what if went the other way? If we have no fives, we're\\ngoing to have 900 tens. So that's going to be the\\npoint 900 tens, 0 fives. So all the combinations of\\nf's and t's that satisfy this are going to be on this\\nline right over there. And I'll just draw a dotted line\\njust because it's easier for me to draw it straight. So that represents all the\\nf's and t's that satisfy the first constraint. Obviously, there's\\na bunch of them, so we don't know\\nwhich is the one that is actually what the troll has. But lucky for us, we have\\na second constraint-- this one right over here. So let's do the same thing. In this constraint, what\\nhappens if we have no tens? If tens are 0, then we\\nhave 5f is equal to 5,500. Let me do a little\\ntable here, because this is a little bit more involved. So for the second\\nequation, tens and fives. If I have no tens, I have\\n5f is equal to 5,500, f will be 1,100. I must have 1,100 fives. If I have no fives,\\nthen this is 0, and I have 10t is\\nequal to 5,500, that means I have 550 tens. So let's plot both\\nat those point. t equals 0, f is 11. That's right about there. So that is 0. 1,100 is on the line that\\nrepresents this equation. And that when f is 0, t is 550. So let's see, this is about--\\nthis would be 6, 7, 8, 9, so 550 is going to\\nbe right over here. So that is the\\npoint 550 comma 0. And all of these\\npoints-- let me try to draw a straight line again. I could do a better\\njob than that. So all of these points\\nare the points-- let me try one more time. We want to get this right. We don't want to get pushed\\ninto the water by the troll. So there you go. That looks pretty good. So every point on this blue line\\nrepresents an ft combination that satisfies the\\nsecond constraint. So what is an f and t, or\\nnumber of fives and number of tens that satisfy\\nboth constraints? Well, it would be\\na point that is sitting on both of the lines. And what is a point that is\\nsitting on both of the lines? Well, that's where\\nthey intersect. This point right over here\\nis clearly on the blue line and is clearly on\\nthe yellow line. And what we can do is, if\\nwe drew this graph really, really precisely, we could\\nsee how many fives that is and how many tens that is. And if you look at it, if\\nyou look at very precisely, and actually I encourage you\\nto graph it very precisely and come up with how many fives\\nand how many tens that is. Well, when we do it right over\\nhere, I'm going to eyeball it. If we look at it\\nright over here, it looks like we\\nhave about 700 fives, and it looks like we\\nhave about 200 tens. And this is based on\\nmy really rough graph. But let's see if that worked. 700 plus 200 is equal to 900. And if I have 700 fives--\\nlet me write this down. 5 times 700 is going to be\\nthe value of the fives, which is $3,500. And then 10 plus 10 times\\n200, which is $2,000, $2,000 is the value of the 10s. And if you add up\\nthe two values, you indeed get to $ 5,500 So this looks right. And so we can tell\\nthe troll-- Troll! I know! I know how many $5\\nand $10 bills you. You have 700 $5 bills, and\\nyou have 200 $10 bills. The troll is\\nimpressed, and he lets you cross the bridge to be the\\nhero or heroine of this fantasy adventure. \"),\n",

So this first one tells us\\nSanjay's dog weighs five times as much as his cat. So how much does his dog weigh? So his dog weighs d, so we\\nknow d is going to be equal to five times as much as his cat weighs. So his cat weighs c, so d is\\ngoing to be equal to five times as much as his cat weighs. So that's one linear\\nequation using d and c. And so what's another one? Well, then we are told his dog\\nis also 20 kilograms heavier than his cat.

       "  \"- [Instructor] In this video, we're going to get a little bit of practice setting up\\nsystems of linear equations based on a word problem. We're not actually going\\nto end up solving it. You can do that if you\\nlike just for kicks. But really we're going to\\njust focus on setting it up. So here we're told Lauren uses\\na blend of dark roast beans and light roast beans to\\nmake coffee at her cafe. She needs 80 kilograms of beans\\nin total for her next order. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and someone wants to spend $220 total. Let D be the number of kilograms of dark roast beans she buys and L be the number of kilograms of light roast beans she buys. All right, so based on this information that we've been given, see\\nif you can pause this video and set up a system of equations. And it's going to have two equations with two unknowns, D and L,\\nthat in theory we could solve to figure out the right\\nnumber of kilograms of dark roast beans and light roast beans that Karen should use. So pause this video and\\ntry to work that out. All right, now let's do it together. And what I'm going to do\\nis I'm going to underline. So let's see, we know\\nthat D is dark roast beans and the L is the number of\\nkilograms of light roast beans. And then they tell us here, they say she needs 80\\nkilograms of beans in total. So what we could say is,\\nhey, the number of kilograms of dark roast beans plus\\nthe number of kilograms of light roast beans needs\\nto be equal to 80 kilograms. So the number of kilograms\\nof dark roast beans plus the number of kilograms\\nof light roast beans. (laughs) I'm having trouble\\nsaying light roast beans. Well, this, what I just underlined here, it says needs to be 80 kilograms in total. So that needs to be 80. So this number of kilograms plus this number of kilograms\\nis going to be equal to your total number of kilograms. All right, so I have one\\nequation with two unknowns. Let's see if we can get another one. So next, they say dark roast\\nbeans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she wants to spend $220 total. So what I just underlined\\nin this aquamarine color we can set up another equation with. And if you haven't already set\\nup your system of equations, see if you can now do that. See if you can set up\\nthis second equation. Pause the video. All right, well, the way to think about it is we just have\\nto have an expression for how much did she\\nspend on dark roast beans, how much did she spend\\non light roast beans, and then we need to\\nadd those two together, and that needs to be equal to $220 'cause that's how much she\\nwants to spend in total. So how much does she\\nspend on dark roast beans? Well, it's going to be\\nthe number of kilograms of dark roast beans that she buys, and it says that it cost $3 per kilogram, so we're gonna multiply it by three. $3 per kilogram times\\nthe number of kilograms of dark roast beans. This is how much she\\nspends on dark roast beans. And so how much is she going\\nto spend on light roast beans? Well, she buys L kilograms\\nof light roast beans. They told us that there. And they cost $2 per kilogram, so $2 per kilogram times\\nthe number of kilograms. This is how much she spends\\non light roast beans. So you add how much she\\nspends on dark roast to how much she spends on light roast, and so this is going to be $220 in total. And there you have it. We have our two equations\\nwith two unknowns, and so now we could go and solve it, but you can do that outside of this video. But the whole point of\\nthis video is to understand how to construct these\\nbased on the constraints, based on the information\\nthat we see in this. So typically when you're\\ntrying to set these up, there's often a sentence or two that will focus on one equation. So this first one is\\nsaying, hey, the kilograms, let's add those up for the\\ntotal number of kilograms. And then there's another\\nsentence or two that'll focus on, in this case, some other equation. In this case, it's the price. So the price of the dark\\nplus the price of the light is going to be equal to the\\ntotal amount she wants to spend. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're told\\nthat Lauren uses a blend of dark roast beans and light roast beans to make coffee at her cafe. She needs 80 kilograms of beans\\nin total for her next order. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she wants to spend $220 in total. And they tell us here's a graph that shows a system of\\nequations for this scenario where x is the number of kilograms of dark roast beans she buys and y is the number of kilograms of light roast beans she buys. All right, let me scroll down\\nso we can take a look at this. And so sure enough, so this blue line, and I'll write it out in blue, this x is the number of\\nkilograms of dark roast beans, y is the number of kilograms\\nof light roast beans, and she wants to buy a\\ntotal of 80 kilograms. That's what they told us up here. We can go back to look at that. She needs, I'll underline this in blue. She needs 80 kilograms of beans. So that constraint that\\nthe sum of the kilograms of dark and light is equal to 80, that's represented by this equation. And if we were to graph it, that is this blue line right over here. And then this other constraint, three x, well, the dark roast beans\\ncost $3 per kilogram, so three x is how much\\nshe spends on dark roast. Two y is how much she\\nspends on light roast 'cause it's $2 per kilogram. And 220 is the amount\\nthat she spends in total. And they tell us that up here. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she wants to spend $220. So this equation is\\nanother way of expressing what I just underlined up here in green. And the green line shows all of the x y combinations that\\nwould match these constraints. And so now let's do something interesting. They've labeled some points\\nhere, point C, D, F, and E. And we're gonna think about what do each of these points represent? So for example, this point\\nC that is on the green line, but it sits above the blue line, what does this tell us? What does this point C represent? Pause this video and think about it. Well, if we're on the green line, that means that the amount\\nthat she spends on dark roast plus the amount that she spends\\non light roast is adding up to exactly $220. So she's definitely spending $220 at C, but how many total kilograms is she using? Well, the fact that for this given x, we're sitting above the line, that means that she's not\\nusing exactly 80 kilograms. And we can see that over here. She's using, looks like\\n10 kilograms of dark, and it looks like something\\nlike 95 kilograms of light. If you were to add those\\ntwo points together, it looks like she's using\\nsomething closer to 105 kilograms. So point C is a situation where she is spending exactly $220, but she's using more than 80 kilograms 'cause it's not meeting\\nthis second constraint. It's sitting above that line. Now let's think about point D. What does that represent? Pause the video and\\ntry to figure that out. Well, because we sit on the blue line, that means that we are\\nmeeting this constraint that the kilograms of\\ndark and light combined is equal to 80 kilograms. So she's using exactly 80 kilograms here, but what about her spending? Well, because this point\\nlies below the green line, that tells us that we are spending less than $220. And we could even try it out. Three times 20 plus two times 60 is what? 60 plus 120 is $180. And so this is a point where\\nwe're meeting this constraint, but we're not meeting this constraint. We're underspending right over here. Now, what about point F? Well, point F sits below\\nboth of these lines. So pause your video and\\nthink about what that means. Well, if we're sitting\\nbelow both of these lines, that means that neither\\nare we spending $220, nor are we using 80 kilograms. And you can see that if you\\nactually look at the numbers. You don't have to do this, but this is just to make\\nyou feel good about it. It looks like she is\\nusing 30 kilograms of dark and 30 kilograms of light,\\nso in total she is using, so this is a situation where she's using 60\\nkilograms in total, not 80. And so that's why we're not\\nsitting on this blue line. And if you look at how\\nmuch she's spending, she has 30 kilograms of each, so three times 30 plus two times 30, that's going to be 90 plus 60. That's also less than 220, and so that's why we see this\\npoint is below these lines. And then last but not least,\\nwhat does point E represent? Well, point E sits on both of these lines, so that means that it meets\\nboth of these constraints. This is a situation where\\nshe is spending exactly $220, and the total number of\\nkilograms she's using of dark and light is exactly 80. And so if we wanted to\\nsay, hey, what combination of dark and light would she need in order to meet both\\nconstraints, E represents that, the intersection of these two lines. \"),\n",

       "  \"Just as you were\\nsolving the potato chip conundrum in the last video,\\nthe king's favorite magical bird comes flying along and starts\\nwhispering into the king's ear. And this makes you a\\nlittle bit self-conscious, a little bit\\ninsecure, so you tell the king, what is the\\nbird talking about. And the king says,\\nwell, the bird says that he thinks that there's\\nanother way to do the problem. And you're not used to\\ntaking advice from birds. And so being a\\nlittle bit defensive, you say, well, if the bird\\nthinks he knows so much, let him do this problem. And so the bird whispers\\na little bit more in the king's ear and\\nsays, OK, well I'll have to do the writing\\nbecause the bird does not have any hands, or at least\\ncan't manipulate chalk. And so the bird continues to\\nwhisper in the king's ear. And the king\\ntranslates and says, well, the bird says, let's\\nuse one of these equations to solve for a variable. So let's say, let's us this\\nblue equation right over here to solve for a variable. And that's essentially\\ngoing to be a constraint of one variable\\nin terms of another. So let's see if we can do that. So here, if we want\\nto solve for m, we could subtract 400\\nw from both sides. And we would have 100 m. If we subtract 400w from the\\nleft, this 400w goes away. If we subtract 400w\\nfrom the right, we have is equal to\\nnegative 400w plus 1,100. So what got us from\\nhere to here is just subtracting 400w\\nfrom both sides. And then if we want\\nto solve for m, we just divide\\nboth sides by 100. So we just divide all\\nof the terms by 100. And then we get m is equal to\\nnegative 400 divided by 100, is negative 4w. 1,100 divided by 100 is 11. Plus 11. So now we've constrained\\nm in terms of w. This is what the\\nbird is saying, using the king as his translator. Why don't we take\\nthis constraint and substitute it back for\\nm in the first equation? And then we will have one\\nequation with one unknown. And so the king starts to\\nwrite at the bird's direction. 200, so he's looking at\\nthat first equation now, he says 200. Instead of putting\\nan m there, the bird says well, by the\\nsecond constraint, m is equal to\\nnegative 4w plus 11. So instead of writing an\\nm, we substitute for m the expression\\nnegative 4w plus 11. And then we have the rest of it,\\nplus 300w, is equal to 1,200. So just to be clear,\\neverywhere we saw an m, we replaced it with\\nthis right over here, in that first equation. So the first thing, you\\nstart to scratch your head. And you say, is this a\\nlegitimate thing to do. Will I get the same\\nanswer as I got when I solved the same\\nproblem with elimination? And I want you to sit and\\nthink about that for a second. But then the bird starts\\nwhispering in the king's ear. And the king just progresses to\\njust work through the algebra. This is one equation\\nwith one unknown now. So the first step would\\nbe to distribute the 200. So 200 times negative\\n4w is negative 800w. 200 times 11 is 2,200. Plus 2,200. And then we have the plus 300w. Plus 300w is equal\\nto positive 1,200. Now we just need to solve for w. We first might want to\\ngroup this negative 800w with this 300w. Negative 800 of something\\nplus 300 of something is going to be negative 500w. And then we still have this\\nplus 2,200 is equal to 1,200. Now to solve for w, we'd want to\\nsubtract 2,200 from both sides. So subtract 2,200,\\nsubtract 2,200. On the left-hand\\nside, you're left just with the negative 500w. And on the right-hand side, you\\nare left with negative 1,000. This is starting to\\nlook interesting, because if we divide both\\nsides by negative 500, we get w is equal to 2, which\\nis the exact same answer that we got when we tried to figure\\nout how many bags of chips each woman would eat on average. When we tried to solve\\nit with elimination, we got the exact right answer. So at least for this example,\\nit seems like the substitution method that this bird came\\nup with worked just as well as the elimination method\\nthat you had originally done the first time you wanted\\nto figure out the potato chip conundrum. And if now, you actually\\nwanted to figure out how many chips\\nthe men would eat, well, you could do\\nexactly the same thing you did the last time. You know one of the variables. You can substitute it back\\ninto one of the equations and then solve for m. And you could try that yourself\\nto verify that you actually will get the same\\nvalue for m as well. And in fact, this would\\nprobably be the easiest equation to substitute into,\\nbecause it explicitly solves for m already. \"),\n",

       "  \"So that it's less likely that we get shown up by talking birds in the future, we've set a little bit of exercise for solving systems of equations with substitution. And so this is the first exercise or the first problem that they give us. -3x-4y=-2 and y=2x-5 So let me get out my little scratch pad and let me rewrite the problem. So this is -3x-4y=-2 and then they tell us y=2x-5. So, what's neat about this is that they've already solved the second equation. They've already made it explicitly solved for y which makes it very easy to substitute for. We can take this constraint, the constraint on y in terms of x and substitute it for y in this first blue equation and then solve for x. So let's try it out. So this first blue equation would then become -3x-4 but instead of putting a y there the second constraint tells us that y needs to be equal to 2x-5. So it's 4(2x-5) and all of that is going to be equal to -2. So now we get just one equation with one unknown. and now we just have to solve for x. So, let's see if we can do that. So, it's -3x and then this part right over here we have a -4, be careful, we have a -4 we want to distribute. We are going to multiply -4*2x which is -8x and -4*-5 is positive 20 and thats going to equal -2. And now we can combine all the x terms so -3x-8x, that's going to be -11x and then we have -11x+20=-2. Now to solve for x, we'll subtract 20 from both sides to get rid of the 20 on the left hand side. On the left hand side, we're just left with the -11x and then on the right hand side we are left with -22. Now we can divide both sides by -11. And we are left with x is equal to 22 divided by 11 is 2, and the negatives cancel out. x = 2. So we are not quite done yet. We've done, I guess you can say the hard part, we have solved for x but now we have to solve for y. We could take this x value to either one of these equations and solve for y. But this second one has already explicitly solved for y so let's use that one, so it says y = 2 times and instead of x, we now know that the x value where these two intersect, you could view it that way is going to be equal to 2, so 2 * 2 - 5 let's figure out the corresponding y value. So you get y=2(2)-5 and y = 4 - 5 so y = -1. And you can verify that it'll work in this top equation If y = -1 and x=2, this top equation becomes -3(2) which is -6-4(-1) which would be plus 4. And -6+4 is indeed -2. So it satisfies both of these equations and now we can type it in to verify that we got it right, although, we know that we did, so x=2 and y=-1. So, let's type it in... x=2 and y=-1. Excellent, now we're much less likely to be embarassed by talking birds. \"),\n",

       "  \"After you cross the troll's\\nbridge and you save the prince or princess, you return them\\nback to their father, the King. And he's so excited that you\\nreturned their son or daughter to him that he wants to\\nthrow a brunch in your honor. But he has a little\\nbit of a conundrum in throwing the brunch. He wants to figure out how\\nmany cupcakes should he order? He doesn't want to\\nwaste any, but he wants to make sure that\\neveryone has enough to eat. And you say, well\\nwhat's the problem here? And he says, well I know\\nadults eat a different number of cupcakes than children eat. And I know that in my\\nkingdom, an adult will always eat the same amount\\nand a child will always eat the same amount. And so you say, King, well what\\ninformation can you give me? I might be able to help\\nyou out a little bit. You're feeling very confident\\nafter this troll situation. And he says, well I know at the\\nlast party we had 500 adults and we had 200\\nchildren, and combined they ate 2,900 cupcakes. And you say, OK,\\nthat's interesting. But I think I'll need a\\nlittle bit more information. Have you thrown\\nparties before then? And the king says,\\nof course I have. I like to throw parties. Well what happened at\\nthe party before that? And he says, well there\\nwe also had 500 adults and we had 300 children. And you say, well\\nhow many cupcakes were eaten at that party? And he says, well we know\\nit was 3,100 cupcakes. And so you get a\\ntingling feeling that a little bit of algebra\\nmight apply over here. And you say, well let me see. What do we need to figure out? We need to figure out the\\nnumber of cupcakes on average that an adult will eat. So number of cupcakes\\nfor an adult. And we also need to\\nfigure out the number of cupcakes for a child. So these are the\\ntwo things that we need to figure out\\nbecause then we can know how many adults\\nand children are coming to the next branch that are\\nbeing held in your honor and get the exact right\\nnumber of cupcakes. So those are things you're\\ntrying to figure out. And we don't know\\nwhat those things are. Let's define some variables\\nthat represent those things. Well let's do a for adults. Let's let a equal the\\nnumber of cupcakes that, on average,\\neach adult eats. And let's do c for children. So c is the number of cupcakes\\nfor a child on average. So given that\\ninformation, let's see how we can represent what the\\nKing has told us algebraically. So let's think about this\\norange information first. How could we represent\\nthis algebraically? Well let's think about\\nhow many cupcakes the adults ate at that party. You had 500 adults, and\\non average, each of them exactly a cupcakes. So the total number of\\ncupcakes that the adults ate were 500 times a. How many did the children eat? Well same logic. You had 200 children and\\nthey each ate c cupcakes. So 200 times c is the\\ntotal number of cupcakes that the children ate. Well how much did\\nthey eat in total? Well it's the total\\nnumber that the adults ate plus the total number\\nthat the children ate which is 2,900 cupcakes. So let's do that and apply that\\nsame logic to the blue party right over here, this\\nblue information. How can we represent\\nthis algebraically? Well once again, how many total\\ncupcakes did the adults eat? Well, you had 500\\nadults and they each ate a cupcakes, which\\nis an unknown right now. And then what\\nabout the children? Well you had 300 children\\nand they each ate c cupcakes. And so if you add\\nup all the cupcakes that the adults ate plus all the\\ncupcakes that the children ate, you get to 3,100 cupcakes. So this is starting\\nto look interesting. I have two equations. I have a system of two\\nequations with two unknowns. And you know from your\\nexperience with the troll that you should be\\nable to solve this. You could solve it graphically\\nlike you did in the past, but now you feel\\nthat there could be another tool in your\\ntool kit which is really just an application of the\\nalgebra that you already know. So think a little bit about\\nhow you might do this. So let's rewrite this first\\nequation right over here. So we have 500a plus 200c\\nis equal to 2,900 cupcakes. Now, it would be good if we\\ncould get rid of this 500a somehow. Well you might say, well\\nlet me just subtract 500a. So you might say, oh, I\\njust want to subtract 500a. But if you subtracted 500a\\nfrom the left hand side, you'd also have to subtract\\n500a from the right hand side. And so the a wouldn't\\njust disappear. It would just end up\\non the right hand side, and you would still\\nhave one equation with two unknowns which\\nisn't too helpful. But you see something\\ninteresting. You're like, well\\nthis is a 500a here. What if I subtracted\\na 500a and this 300c? So if I subtracted\\nthe 500a and the 300c from the left hand side. And you're like, well\\nwhy is that useful? You're going to do the same\\nthing on the right hand side and then you're going to have\\nan a and a c on the right hand. And you just say, hold on,\\nhold on one second here. Hold on, I guess you're\\ntalking to yourself. Hold on one second. I'm subtracting the left\\nhand side of this equation, but this left hand side\\nis the exact same thing as this right hand side. So here I could\\nsubtract 500a and 300c, and I could do 500a and\\nsubtract 300c over here. But we know that\\nsubtracting 500a and 300c, that's the exact same\\nthing as subtracting 3,100. Let me make it clear. This is 500a minus 300c\\nis the exact same thing as subtracting 500a plus 300c. And we know that 500a plus\\n300c is exactly 3,100. This is 3,100. This is what the second\\ninformation gave us. So instead of subtracting\\n500a and minus 300c, we can just subtract 3,100. So let me do that. This is exciting. So let me clear that out. So let's clear that out. And so here, instead\\nof doing this, I can subtract the exact same\\nvalue, which we know is 3,100, subtract 3,100. So looking at it\\nthis way, it looks like we're subtracting\\nthis bottom equation from the top equation, but\\nwe're really just subtracting the same thing from both sides. This is just very\\nbasic algebra here. But if we do that,\\nlet's see what happens. So on the left hand side, 500a\\nminus 500a, those cancel out. 200c minus 300c, that\\ngives us negative 100c. And on the right hand\\nside, 2,900 minus 3,100 is negative 200. Well now we have one\\nequation with one unknown, and we know how to solve this. We can divide both\\nsides by negative 100. These cancel out. And then over here, you\\nend up with a positive 2. So c is equal to positive 2. So we've solved one\\nof the unknowns, the each child on\\naverage drinks two cups. So c is equal to 2. So how can we figure\\nout what a is? Well now we can take\\nthis information and go back into either one\\nof these and figure out what a has to be. So let's go back into the\\norange one right over here and figure out what a has to be. So we had 500a plus 200c, but\\nwe know what c is, c is 2. So 200 times 2 is\\nequal to 2,900. And now we just\\nhave to solve for a, one equation with one unknown. So we have 500a,\\n200 times 2 is 400, plus 400 is equal to 2,900. We can subtract 400 from\\nboth sides of this equation. Let me do that. Subtracting 400, and we are\\nleft with this cancels out. And on the left hand\\nside, we have 500a. This is very exciting. We're in the home stretch. On the right hand\\nside, you have 2,500. 500a equals 2,500. We can divide both\\nsides by 500, and we are left with 2,500\\ndivided by 500 is just 5. So you have a is equal\\nto 5 and you're done. You have solved the\\nKing's conundrum. Each child on average drinks\\n2 cups of water-- sorry, not cups of water. I don't know where\\nI got that from. Each child 2 cupcakes and each\\nadult will eat 5 cupcakes. a is equal to 5. And so based on how many\\nadults and children are coming to the brunch in\\nyour honor, you now know exactly the\\nnumber of cupcakes that the King needs to order. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're asked\\nwhich of these strategies would eliminate a variable in the system of equations? Choose all answers that apply. So this first one says add the equations. So pause this video. Would adding the equations\\neliminate a variable in this system? All right, now let's do it together. So if we add these equations, we have, on the left hand side, we have five x plus five x, which is going to be 10 x, and then you have negative\\nthree y plus four y which is just a positive\\none y or just plus y is equal to negative three plus six, which is just going to be\\nequal to positive three. We haven't eliminated any variables, so choice A, I could rule out. That did not eliminate a variable. Let me cross it out and not check it. Subtract the bottom equation from the top. Well when we subtract\\nthe bottom from the top, five x minus five x, that's going to be zero x's,\\nso I won't even write it down, and we've already seen\\nwe've eliminated an x so I'm already feeling\\ngood about choice B, but then we can see negative\\nthree y minus four y is negative seven y. Negative three minus six is\\ngoing to be negative nine and so choice B does\\nsuccessfully eliminate the x's. So I will select that. Choice C, multiply the\\ntop equation by two, then add the equations. Pause the video. Does that eliminate a variable? Well we're gonna multiply\\nthe top equation by two so it's going to become 10 x minus six y is equal to negative six, and you could already see if\\nyou then add the equations, 10 x plus five x, you're gonna have 15 x, that's not gonna get eliminated. Negative six y plus four\\ny is negative two y. That's not going to be eliminated, so we can rule that out, as well. Let's do another example. One, they're asking us the same question. Which of these strategies\\nwould eliminate a variable in the system of equations? The first choice says multiply\\nthe bottom equation by two, then add the equations. Pause this video, does that work? All right, so if we multiply\\nthe bottom equation by two, we are going to get, if we multiply it by two, we're gonna get two x minus\\ntwo minus four y, I should say. Two x, I'm just multiplying\\neverything by two, minus four y is equal to 10. And then if we were to add the equations. Four x plus two x is six x, so that doesn't get eliminated. Positive four y plus negative\\nfour y is equal to zero y, so the y's actually do get eliminated when you add four y to negative four y. So I like choice A and\\nI'm gonna delete this so I have space to work\\non the other choices, so I like one. What about choice B? Pause the video, does that work? Multiply the bottom equation by four, then subtract the bottom\\nequation from the top equation. All right, let's multiply\\nthe bottom equation by four. What do we get? We're going to get four x minus eight y is equal to 20, yup. We multiplied it by four and then subtract the bottom\\nequation from the top. So we would subtract four x from four x. Well that's looking good. That would eliminate the x's, so I'm feeling good about choice B. And then we could see if we\\nsubtract negative eight y from four y, well, subtracting\\na negative's the same thing as adding a positive, so that would actually get us to 12 y if we're subtracting\\nnegative eight y from four y. And then if we subtract\\n20 from negative two, we get to negative 22, but we see that four x minus four x is going to eliminate our x's, so that does definitely\\neliminate a variable, so I like choice B. Now what about choice C? Multiply the top equation by 1/2, then add the equations. Let's try that out, pause the video. All right, let's just multiply times 1/2, so the left hand side times 1/2, we distribute the one half\\nis one way to think about it. Four x times 1/2 is going to be two x plus four y times 1/2 is two y is equal to negative two times 1/2 is equal to negative one. Now and then they say add the equations. So two x plus x is going to be three x, so that's not going to eliminate the x's. Two y plus negative two y, well that's going to be no y's. So that actually will eliminate the y's, so I like this choice, as well. So actually, all three of these strategies would eliminate a variable\\nin the system of equations. This is useful to see 'cause you can see there's\\nmultiple ways to approach solving a system like\\nthis through elimination. Let's do another example. Which of these strategies\\nwould eliminate a variable in the system of equations? Same question again. So the first one, they suggest to subtract\\nthe bottom equation from the top equation. Pause this video, does that work? Well if we subtract the\\nbottom from the top, so if you subtract a negative two x, that's the same thing as adding two x, 'cause you're adding two x\\nto three x, that's five x. The x's don't get eliminated. Subtracting four y from negative\\nthree y's just gonna get us to negative seven y. The y's don't get eliminated, so I would rule this one out. Nothing's getting eliminated there. Multiply the top equation by three, multiply the bottom equation by two, then add the equations. Pause the video, does that work? All right, so if I multiply\\nthe top equation by three, I'm going to get nine x minus nine y is equal to 21, and then if I multiply the bottom by two, so this is times two, I'm going to get two times\\nnegative two is negative four x plus eight y is equal to 14, and then they say add the equations. Well if I add nine x to negative four x, that doesn't eliminate the x's. That gets me to positive five x, and if I add negative nine\\ny to a positive eight y, that also doesn't eliminate the y's. That gets me to a negative y, so choice B, I can also rule out. Once again deleting all of this so I have space to try\\nto figure out choice C. Multiply the top equation by two, multiply the bottom equation by three, then add the equation. So they're telling us to\\ndo it the other way around. Pause the video, does this work? All right, so we multiply\\nthe top equation by two and we're gonna multiply the\\nbottom equation by three. So the top equation times two is going to be six x minus six y is equal to, is equal to 14. And then with this bottom equation, when you multiply it by three, both sides, that's the only way to\\nensure that the equation is saying the same thing\\nis if you do the same thing to both sides. That's really the heart of algebra. So negative two times\\nthree is negative six x, and I already like where this is going, 'cause when I add these two, they're going to get eliminated, plus four y times three\\nis gonna be plus 12 y is going to be equal to 21. And then they say add the equations, well, you immediately see\\nwhen you add the x terms on the left hand side, they are going to cancel out. So I like choice C. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] So we have a system of two linear equations here. This first equation, X minus\\nfour Y is equal to negative 18, and the second equation,\\nnegative X plus three Y is equal to 11. Now what we're gonna do\\nis find an X and Y pair that satisfies both of these equations. That's what solving the\\nsystem actually means. As you might already have seen, there's a bunch of X and Y pairs that satisfy this first equation. In fact, if you were to graph them, they would form a line, and there's a bunch of other X and Y pairs that satisfy this other equation, the second equation, and if you were to graph them, it would form a line. And so if you find the X and\\nY pair that satisfy both, that would be the\\nintersection of the lines, so let's do that. So actually, I'm just gonna rewrite the first equation over here, so I'm gonna write X minus four Y is equal to negative 18. So, we've already seen in algebra that as long as we do the same thing to both sides of the equation, we can maintain our equality. So what if we were to add, and our goal here is to\\neliminate one of the variables so we have one equation with one unknown, so what if we were to add this negative X plus three Y\\nto the left hand side here? So negative X plus three Y, well, that looks pretty good because an X and a negative\\nX are going to cancel out, and we are going to be left with negative four Y, plus three Y. Well, that's just going to be negative Y. So by adding the left hand side of this bottom equation\\nto the left hand side of the top equation, we were able to cancel out the Xs. We had X, and we had a negative X. That was very nice for us. So what do we do on the right hand side? We've already said that we have to add the same thing to both\\nsides of an equation. We might be tempted to just say, well, if I\\nhave to add the same thing to both sides, well, maybe I have to add a negative X plus three Y to that side. But that's not going to help us much. We're gonna have negative\\n18 minus X plus three Y. We would have introduced an X on the right hand side of the equation, but what if we could add something that's equivalent to\\nnegative X plus three Y that does not introduce the X variable? Well, we know that the number 11 is equivalent to negative X plus three Y. How do we know that? Well, that second equation tells us that. So once again, all I'm doing\\nis I'm adding the same thing to both sides of that top equation. On the left, I'm expressing\\nit as negative X plus three Y, but the second equation tells us that negative X plus three Y is going to be equal to 11. It's introducing that second constraint, and so let's add 11 to\\nthe right hand side, which is, once again, I\\nknow I keep repeating it, it's the same thing as\\nnegative X plus three Y. So negative 18 plus 11 is negative seven, and since we added the\\nsame thing to both sides, the equality still holds, and we get negative Y is\\nequal to negative seven, or divide both sides by negative one or multiply both sides by negative one. So multiply both sides by negative one. We get Y is equal to seven, so we have the Y coordinate of the X, Y pair that\\nsatisfies both of these. Now how do we find the X? Well, we can just substitute\\nthis Y equals seven to either one of these. When Y equals seven, we\\nshould get the same X regardless of which equation we use. So let's use the top equation. So we know that X minus four times, instead of writing Y, I'm gonna write four times seven 'cause we're gonna figure out what is X when Y is seven? That is going to be equal to negative 18, and so let's see, negative\\nfour or four times seven. That is 28. So let's see, I could just solve for X. I could add 28 to both sides, so add 28 to both sides. On the left hand side, negative 28, positive\\n28, those cancel out. I'm just left with an X, and on the right hand side, I get negative 18 plus 28 is 10. So there you have it. I have the X, Y pair that satisfies both. X equals 10. Y equals seven. I could write it here. So I could write it as coordinates. I could write it as 10 comma seven, and notice, what I just did here, I encourage you. Substitute Y equals seven here, and you would also get X equals 10. Either way, you would\\nhave come to X equals 10, and to visualize what is going on here, let's visualize it really fast. Let me draw some coordinate axes. Whoops, I meant to draw a\\nstraighter line than that. Alright, there you go, so let's say that is our Y axis, and that is, whoops, that is our X axis, and then, let's see, the top equation is gonna\\nlook something like this. It's gonna look something like this, and then that bottom equation is gonna look something like, lemme draw a little bit nicer than that. It's going to look something like this, something like that. Lemme draw that bottom one here so you see the point of intersection, and so the point of\\nintersection right over here, that is an X, Y pair that satisfies both of these equations, and that we just saw, it happens when X is equal to 10, and Y is equal to seven. Once again, this white line, that's all the X and Y pairs that satisfy the top equation. This orange line, that's\\nall the X and Y pairs that satisfy the orange equation, and where they intersect, that point is on both lines. It satisfies both equations, and once again, take X equals 10, Y equals seven. Substitute it back into\\neither one of these, and you will see that it holds. \"),\n",

       "  \"Everyone in the kingdom is very\\nimpressed with your ability to help with the party\\nplanning, everyone except for this gentlemen\\nright over here. This is Arbegla. And he is the\\nking's top adviser, and also chief party planner. And he seems somewhat\\nthreatened by your ability to solve these otherwise\\nunsolvable problems, or at least from\\nhis point of view, because he keeps over-ordering\\nor under-ordering things like cupcakes. And he says, king, that\\ncupcake problem was easy. Ask them about the\\npotato chip issue, because we could never get\\nthe potato chips right. And so the king says,\\nArbegla, that's a good idea. We need to get the\\npotato chips right. So he comes to you\\nand says, how do we figure out, on average, how many\\npotato chips we need to order? And to do that, we\\nhave to figure out how much, on average,\\ndoes each man eat and how much each woman eats. You say, well, what\\nabout the children? The king says, in\\nour kingdom, we forbid potato\\nchips for children. You say, oh, well,\\nthat's all and good. Tell me what happened\\nat the previous parties. And so the king says, you might\\nremember, at the last party, in fact, the last two\\nparties, we had 500 adults. At the last party, 200 of\\nthem were men, and 300 of them were women. And in total, they ate\\n1,200 bags of potato chips. And you say, what about\\nthe party before that? He says, that one, we had a\\nbigger skew towards women. We only had 100 men,\\nand we have 400 women. And that time, we\\nactually had fewer bags consumed-- 1,100\\nbags of potato chips. So you say, OK, king\\nand Arbegla, this seems like a fairly\\nstraightforward thing. Let me define some variables\\nto represent our unknowns. So you go ahead\\nand you say, well, let's let m equal the number\\nof bags eaten by each man. And you could think\\nof it on average, or maybe all the\\nmen in that kingdom are completely identical. Or maybe it's the average number\\nof bags eaten by each man. And let's let w equal the number\\nof bags eaten by each woman. And so with these\\ndefinitions of our variables, let's think about\\nhow we can represent this first piece of information,\\nthis piece of information in green. Well, let's think about\\nthe total number of bags that the men ate. You had 200 men. Let me scroll over a little bit. You had 200 men, and they each\\nate m bags, m bags per man. So the men at this\\nfirst party collectively ate 200 times m bags. If m is 10 bags per man,\\nthen this would be 2,000. If m was 5 bags per man,\\nthen this would be 5,000. We don't know what m\\nis, but 200 times m is the total eaten by the men. Same logic-- total\\neaten by the women is 300 women times the number\\nof bags eaten by each woman. And so if you add the total to\\neaten by the men and the women, you get the 1,200 bags. So this is information,\\nwritten algebraically, given these variable\\ndefinitions. Now, let's do the same\\nthing with the second part of the information that they\\ngave us right over here. Let's think about how we can\\nrepresent this algebraically. Well, similar logic--\\nwhat was a total that the men ate at that party? It was 100 men times\\nm bags per man. And we're assuming that m\\nis the same across parties, that men, on average, always\\neat the same number of bags. And how many did the women\\neat at that second party? Well, you had 400 women. And on average, they\\nate w bags per woman. So this is 400 times\\nw is the total number that the women ate. You add those two together,\\nyou get the total number that all the adults ate. So this is going\\nto be 1,100 bags. So it looks pretty similar now. You have a system of two\\nequations with two unknowns. And so you try your\\nbest to solve it. But when you solve it, you\\nsee something interesting. Last time, it was\\nvery convenient. You had a, I think it was\\na 500 here, for 500 adults, and you had another 500. And so it seemed\\nlike it was pretty easy to cancel out\\none of the variables. Here it seems a little\\nbit more difficult. What's multiplying by the\\nm's, it's different here. The coefficient on the w\\nis different over here. You say, well, maybe I can\\nchange one of these equations so it makes it a little\\nbit easier to cancel out with the other equation. So what if, for example, I\\nwere to take this blue equation right over here and\\nmultiply it by negative 2? And you might say,\\nwell, Sal, why are we multiplying it by negative 2? Well, if were to multiply\\nit by negative 2, this 100m would become\\na negative 200m. And if it was a\\nnegative 200m, then that would cancel out\\nwith a positive 200m when we add the two. So let's see what happens. So let's multiply this blue\\nequation by negative 2. We're going to\\nmultiply by negative 2. Let me scroll over to\\nthe left a little bit. So what happens? Remember, when we\\nmultiply an equation, we can't just do one\\nside of the equation. We have to do the\\nentire equation in order for the equality to hold true. So negative 2 times\\n100m is negative 200m. Negative 2 times 400w-- there's\\na positive right over there. So it becomes negative 800w. And then negative 2-- now,\\nwe did the left hand side, but we also have to do\\nthe right hand side. Negative 2 times 1,100\\nis negative 2,200. So just to be\\nclear, this equation that I just wrote\\nhere essentially has the same information\\nwe just manipulated. We just changed this equation,\\nmultiplied both sides by negative 2. But it's kind of\\nthe same constraint. But what makes this\\ninteresting is, now, we can rewrite\\nthis green equation. Let me do it over\\nhere, this first one. 200m plus 300w is\\nequal to 1,200. And the whole reason why\\nI multiplied by negative 2 is, so that if I were\\nto add these two things, I might be able to get rid\\nof that variable over there. And so let's do that. Let's add the left hand sides,\\nand let's add the right hand sides. And you could literally\\nview it as, we're starting with this\\nblue equation. We're adding this\\nquantity, the left hand side of the yellow equation to\\nthe left hand side of the blue. And then 1,200 is\\nthe exact same thing that we're adding to\\nthe right hand side. We know that this\\nis equal to this. So we can add this to the\\nleft hand side and this to the right hand side. So let's see what happens. So the good thing is,\\nthe whole reason we multiplied it by negative\\n2, so that these two characters cancel out. You add those two together. You just get 0m or just 0. You have negative\\n800w plus 300w. Well, that's negative 500w. And then on the\\nright hand side, you have negative 2,200 plus 1,200. So that's negative 1,000. And now this is pretty\\nstraightforward-- one equation, one unknown,\\na fairly straightforward equation. We divide both sides by\\nthe coefficient of w, multiplying w. So divide by negative 500 on\\nthe left, divide by negative 500 on the right. And we are left with\\nw is equal to 2. On average, women ate\\ntwo bags of potato chips at these parties. We're assuming that's\\nconstant across the parties. So let's think about how\\nyou would then figure out how many bags, on\\naverage, each man ate. Well, to do that,\\nwe just go back to either one of\\nthese equations. In the last set of videos, I\\nwent to the first equation. I'll show that the second\\nequation should also work. Either one should work. So let's substitute back\\ninto the second equation. And you could either pick this\\nversion of it or this one. But I'll pick the original one. So you have 100\\ntimes m, which we're trying to figure out,\\nplus 400 times-- well, we now know that w is\\nequal to 2-- 400 times 2 is equal to 1,100. So you have 100m plus\\n800 is equal to 1,100. And now, to solve for\\nm, we could subtract 800 from both sides. And we are left with\\n100m is equal to 300. And now, divide\\nboth sides by 100. And we are left with m, which\\nis, on average, the number of bags of chips each\\nman eats is equal to 3. So you have solved\\nArbegla's problem, what he thought was a\\ndifficult problem, using the magical, mystical\\npowers of algebra. You were able to tell the king\\nin his party planning process that, on average,\\nthe men will eat three bags of potato chips each. And on average,\\nthe women will eat two bags of potato chips each. \"),\n",

       "  \"Let's solve a few more systems\\nof equations using elimination, but in these it\\nwon't be kind of a one-step elimination. We're going to have to massage\\nthe equations a little bit in order to prepare them\\nfor elimination. So let's say that we have an\\nequation, 5x minus 10y is equal to 15. And we have another equation,\\n3x minus 2y is equal to 3. And I said we want to do\\nthis using elimination. Once again, we could use\\nsubstitution, we could graph both of these lines and figure\\nout where they intersect. But we're going to\\nuse elimination. But the first thing you might\\nsay, hey, Sal, you know, with elimination, you were\\nsubtracting the left-hand side of one equation from another,\\nor adding the two, and then adding the two right-hand\\nsides. And I could do that, because it\\nwas essentially adding the same thing to both sides\\nof the equation. But here, it's not\\nobvious that that would be of any help. If we added these two left-hand\\nsides, you would get 8x minus 12y. That wouldn't eliminate\\nany variables. And on the right-hand\\nside, you would just be left with a number. And if you subtracted,\\nthat wouldn't eliminate any variables. So how is elimination\\ngoing to help here? And the answer is, we can\\nmultiply both of these equations in such a way that\\nmaybe we can get one of these terms to cancel out with\\none of the others. And you could really\\npick which term you want to cancel out. Let's say we want to cancel out\\nthe y terms. So I'll just rewrite this 5x minus\\n10y here. 5x minus 10y is equal to 15. Now, is there anything that\\nI can multiply this green equation by so that this\\nnegative 2y term becomes a term that will cancel out\\nwith the negative 10y? So I essentially want to make\\nthis negative 2y into a positive 10y. Right? Because if this is a positive\\n10y, it'll cancel out when I add the left-hand sides\\nof this equation. So what can I multiply\\nthis equation by? Well, if I multiply it by\\nnegative 5, negative 5 times negative 2 right here would\\nbe positive 10. So let's do that. Let's multiply this equation\\ntimes negative 5. So you multiply the left-hand\\nside by negative 5, and multiply the right-hand\\nside by negative 5. And what do you get? Remember, we're not\\nfundamentally changing the equation. We're not changing the\\ninformation in the equation. We're doing the same thing\\nto both sides of it. So the left-hand side of the\\nequation becomes negative 5 times 3x is negative 15x. And then negative 5 times\\nnegative 2y is plus 10y, is equal to 3 times negative\\n5 is negative 15. And now, we're ready to\\ndo our elimination. If we add this to the left-hand\\nside of the yellow equation, and we add the\\nnegative 15 to the right-hand side of the yellow equation, we\\nare adding the same thing to both sides of the equation. Because this is equal to that. So let's do that. So 5x minus 15y-- we have this\\nlittle negative sign there, we don't want to lose that--\\nthat's negative 10x. The y's cancel out. Negative 10y plus\\n10y, that's 0y. That was the whole point behind\\nmultiplying this by negative 5. Is going to be equal to--\\n15 minus 15 is 0. So negative 10x is equal to 0. Divide both sides by negative\\n10, and you get x is equal to 0. And now we can substitute back\\ninto either of these equations to figure out what y\\nmust be equal to. Let's substitute into\\nthe top equation. So we get 5 times 0, minus\\n10y, is equal to 15. Or negative 10y is\\nequal to 15. Let me write that. Negative 10y is equal to 15. Divide both sides\\nby negative 10. And we are left with\\ny is equal to 15/10, is negative 3/2. So if you were to graph it,\\nthe point of intersection would be the point\\n0, negative 3/2. And you can verify that it also\\nsatisfies this equation. The original equation over\\nhere was 3x minus 2y is equal to 3. 3 times 0, which is 0, minus 2\\ntimes negative 3/2 is, this is 0, this is positive 3. Right? These cancel out, these\\nbecome positive. Plus positive 3 is equal to 3. So this does indeed satisfy\\nboth equations. Let's do another one of these\\nwhere we have to multiply, and to massage the equations, and\\nthen we can eliminate one of the variables. Let's do another one. Let's say we have 5x plus\\n7y is equal to 15. And we have 7-- let me do\\nanother color-- 7x minus 3y is equal to 5. Now once again, if you just\\nadded or subtracted both the left-hand sides, you're\\nnot going to eliminate any variables. These aren't in any way kind of\\nhave the same coefficient or the negative of their\\ncoefficient. So let's pick a variable\\nto eliminate. Let's say we want to eliminate\\nthe x's this time. And you could literally\\npick on one of the variables or another. It doesn't matter. You can say let's eliminate the\\ny's first. But I'm going to choose to eliminate the x's\\nfirst. And so what I need to do is massage one or both of\\nthese equations in a way that these guys have the same\\ncoefficients, or their coefficients are the negatives\\nof each other, so that when I add the left-hand sides, they're\\ngoing to eliminate each other. Now, there's nothing obvious--\\nI can multiply this by a fraction to make it equal\\nto negative 5. Or I can multiply this by a\\nfraction to make it equal to negative 7. But even a more fun thing to do\\nis I can try to get both of them to be their least\\ncommon multiple. I could get both\\nof these to 35. And the way I can do it is by\\nmultiplying by each other. So I can multiply this\\ntop equation by 7. And I'm picking 7 so that\\nthis becomes a 35. And I can multiply this bottom\\nequation by negative 5. And the reason why I'm doing\\nthat is so this becomes a negative 35. Remember, my point is I want\\nto eliminate the x's. So if I make this a 35, and if\\nI make this a negative 35, then I'm going to be all set. I can add the left-hand\\nand the right-hand sides of the equations. So this top equation, when you\\nmultiply it by 7, it becomes-- let me scroll up a little bit--\\nwe multiply it by 7, it becomes 35x plus 49y is equal\\nto-- let's see, this is 70 plus 35 is equal to 105. Right? 15 and 70, plus 35,\\nis equal to 105. That's what the top\\nequation becomes. This bottom equation becomes\\nnegative 5 times 7x, is negative 35x, negative 5 times\\nnegative 3y is plus 15y. The negatives cancel out. And then 5-- this isn't a\\nminus 5-- this is times negative 5. 5 times negative 5 is equal\\nto negative 25. Now, we can start with this top\\nequation and add the same thing to both sides, where that\\nsame thing is negative 25, which is also equal\\nto this expression. So let's add the left-hand\\nsides and the right-hand sides. Because we're really adding the\\nsame thing to both sides of the equation. So the left-hand side,\\nthe x's cancel out. 35x minus 35x. That was the whole point. They cancel out, and on the\\ny's, you get 49y plus 15y, that is 64y. 64y is equal to 105 minus\\n25 is equal to 80. Divide both sides by 64, and you\\nget y is equal to 80/64. And let's see, if you divide\\nthe numerator and the denominator by 8-- actually\\nyou could probably do 16. 16 would be better. But let's do 8 first,\\njust because we know our 8 times tables. So that becomes 10/8, and then\\nyou can divide this by 2, and you get 5/4. If you divided just straight\\nup by 16, you would've gone straight to 5/4. So y is equal to 5/4. Let's figure out what x is. So we can substitute either into\\none of these equations, or into one of the original\\nequations. Let's substitute into the\\nsecond of the original equations, where we had 7x\\nminus 3y is equal to 5. That was the original version of\\nthe second equation that we later transformed into this. So we get 7x minus 3 times y,\\ntimes 5/4, is equal to 5. Or 7x minus 15/4\\nis equal to 5. Let's add 15/4-- Oh, sorry,\\nI didn't do that right. This would be 7x minus 3 times\\n4-- Oh, sorry, that was right. What am I doing? 3 times is 15/4. Is equal to 5. Let's add 15/4 to both sides. And what do we get? The left-hand side just\\nbecomes a 7x. These guys cancel out. And that's going to be\\nequal to 5, is the same thing as 20/4. 20/4 plus 15/4. Or we get that-- let me scroll\\ndown a little bit-- 7x is equal to 35/4. We can multiply both sides by\\n1/7, or we could divide both sides by 7, same thing. Let's multiply both\\nsides by 1/7. The same thing as\\ndividing by 7. So these cancel out and you're\\nleft with x is equal to-- Here, if you divide 35\\nby 7, you get 5. You divide 7 by 7, you get 1. So x is equal to 5/4 as well. So the point of intersection of\\nthis right here is both x and y are going to\\nbe equal to 5/4. So if you looked at it as a\\ngraph, it'd be 5/4 comma 5/4. And let's verify that this\\nsatisfies the top equation. And if you take 5 times\\n5/4, plus 7 times 5/4, what do you get? It should be equal to 15. So this is equal to 25/4,\\nplus-- what is this? This is plus 35/4. Which is equal to 60/4, which\\nis indeed equal to 15. So it does definitely satisfy\\nthat top equation.

       "  'so now we have a very very very interesting problem on the left hand side of the scale I have two different types of unknown masses one of these X masses and we know that they have the same identical mass, we call that identical each of them having a mass of X But then we have this other blue thing and that has a mass of Y, which isn\\'t necessarily going to be the same as the mass of X. We have two of these X\\'s and a Y.It seems like the total mass or it definitely is the case, their total mass balance it out to these 8 kg right over here. Each of these is 1kg block and balances them out. So the first question I\\'m going to ask you is, can you express this Mathematically? Can you express what we\\'re seeing here, the fact that this total mass balances out with this total mass. Can you express that mathematically? Well let\\'s just think about our total mass on this side. We have two masses of mass X so those two are gonna total at 2X, and then you have a mass of Y. So then you\\'re gonna have another Y. So the total mass on the left hand side. Alright let me re-write a little bit closer to the center. So,it doesn\\'t get too spread out. On the left hand side, I got 2X plus a mass of Y. That\\'s the total mass. The total mass on the left hand side is 2X plus Y, the total mass on the right hand side is just 8. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. It is equal to 8 And since we see that the scale is balance, this total mass must be equal to this total mass. So, we can write an equal sign there. Now my question to you is there anything we can do just based on the information that we have here to solve for either the mass X or for the mass Y. Is there anything that we can do. Well the simple answer is just with this information here, there\\'s actually very little. You might say that \"Oh well, let me take the Y from both sides\" You might take this Y block up. But if you take this Y block up you have to take away Y from this side and you don\\'t know what Y is. And if you think about it algebraically you might get rid of the Y here. Subtracting Y and you\\'re gonna subtract Y from this side too. So, you\\'re not gonna get rid of the Y. Same thing with the X\\'s, you actually don\\'t have enough information. Y depends on what X is,and X depends on what Y is. Lucky for us however,we do have some more of these blocks laying around. And what we do is we take one of these X blocks. And I stack it over here,and I also take one of the Y block and I stack it right over there. And then I keep adding all these ones until I balance these things out. So, I keep adding these ones. Obviously if I just place this, this will go down cause there\\'s nothing on that side. But I keep adding these blocks until it all balances out and I find that my scale balances once I have 5 kg on the right hand side So, once again let me ask you this information having X and Y on the left hand side and a 5kg on the right hand side And the fact that they are balance, how can we represent that mathematically? Well our total mass on the left hand side is X plus Y. And our total mass, let me right that once again a little bit closer to the center. It\\'s X plus Y on the left hand side and the right hand side I have 5 kg. I have 5kg. I have 5 kg on the right hand side. And we know that\\'s actually balance the scale. So these total masses must be equal to each other. And this information by itself, once again. There\\'s nothing I can do with it. I don\\'t know what X and Y. If Y is 4 maybe X is 1 or maybe X is 4, Y is 1. Who knows what these are. The interesting thing is we can actually use both of these information to figure out what X and Y actually is. And I\\'m giving you a few seconds to think about how we can approach this situation. Well think about it this way, we know that X plus Y is equal to 5. So if we were to get rid of an X and a Y on this side,on the left hand side of the equation. What would we have to get rid of on the right hand side of the, or if we know if we get rid of X and Y on the left hand side of the scale What would we get rid of the right hand side of the scale to take away the same mass? Well if we take away the X and Y on the left hand side, we know that an X plus Y is 5kg. So, we\\'ll just have to take 5kg from the right hand side. So, lets think about what that would do. Well then I\\'ll just have an X over here, I\\'ll just have some of these masses left over here.Then I would what X is. Now lets think about how we can represent that algebraically Essentially for taking an X and Y from the left hand side. If I\\'m taking an X and Y from the left hand side. I\\'m subtracting an X, and I\\'m subtracting an X. Actually let me think of it this way. I\\'m subtracting an X plus Y. I\\'m subtracting an X and Y on the left hand side. But then what am I gonna do on the right hand side? Well an X and a Y we know has a mass of 5. So we can subtract 5 from the right hand side. And the only way I\\'m gonna be able to do this is because of the information that we got from the second scale. So I can take away 5. So this is going to be equal to taking away 5. Taking away X and a Y is equal to taking away 5. And we know that because an X and a Y is equal to 5kg. And if we take away an X and a Y on the left hand side, what do we left with? Well this is gonna be the same thing. Let me rewrite this part. This, taking away an X and a Y is the same thing if you distribute the negative sign as taking away an X and taking away a Y. And so on the left hand side, we\\'re left with just 2X and we have taken away one of the X\\'s, we\\'re left just an X. And we had a Y and we\\'ve took away one of the Y. So we\\'re left with no Y. We see that visually, we\\'re left with just an X here. And what do we have on the right hand side? We had 8 and we know X and Y is equal to 5, so we took away 5. So to keep the scale balance. And so 8 minus 5 is going to be 3. 8 minus 5 is equal to 3 and just like that using this extra information we\\'re able to figure out that the mass of X is equal to 3. Now, one final question. We\\'re able to figure out the mass of X, can you figure out what the mass of Y is. Well we can go back to either one of these scales. Probably be simpler to go back to this one. We know that the mass of X plus the mass of Y is equal to 5. So we could say, one thing we know that X is now is equal to 3. We know that this is now a 3kg mass. We can rewrite this is 3 plus Y is equal to 5 Well now we say, we could take 3 away from both sides. if I take 3 away from the left hand side I just have to take 3 away from the right hand side to keep my scale balanced. And I\\'ll be left with the mass of Y is balance with a mass of 2 or Y is equal to 2. That\\'s an analogy of taking 3 from both sides of this equation. And on the left hand side, I\\'m just left with a Y and on the right hand side I\\'m just left with a 2. So, X is equal to 3kg and Y is equal to 2kg and what I encouraged you to do is verify that it made sense right up here. Figure out what the total mass on the left hand and the right hand or verify what the total mass right over here really was 8 to begin with. And you\\'ll see that 2Xs are gonna be 6kg plus my Y is 2kg that will balance 8kg. And 3 plus 2 was equal to 5. '),\n",

       "  '- [Voiceover] \"Vivek and Camila\\'s\\nteacher gave them a system \"of linear equations to solve. \"They each took a few steps that lead \"to the systems shown in the table below.\" So we have the teacher\\'s original system, what Vivek got after\\ndoing some operations, what Camila got after\\ndoing some operations. Which of them obtained a\\nsystem that is equivalent to the teacher\\'s system? So the first question\\nwe should ask ourselves is what does it mean to even\\nhave an equivalent system? For the sake of this\\nquestion, or for our purposes, an equivalent system is a system\\nthat has the same solution. So if there\\'s some X-Y pair that satisfies the teacher\\'s system that is the solution to the teacher\\'s system. Well Vivek\\'s system, we\\'re\\ngonna call it equivalent if it has the same solution. Similarly, if Camila\\'s\\nsystem has the same solution, then we\\'re gonna call it\\nequivalent to the teacher\\'s system. So let\\'s make some comparisons here. So first let\\'s look at Vivek. So his first equation\\nis actually unchanged from the teacher\\'s equation, is unchanged from the teacher\\'s equation, so any solution that meets\\nboth of these equations is for sure gonna meet this top equation because it\\'s literally the\\nsame as the top equation of the teacher, so that works out. Also look at the second one. The second one is definitely a\\ndifferent equation over here. We can check that it\\'s\\nnot just being multiplied by some number on both sides. To go from one to zero\\nif you were multiplying, you would have to multiply one times zero and then in order to\\nmaintain the equality, you would have to do that on both sides. But zero times this left-hand\\nside would have been zero, you would have gotten zero equals zero, so he didn\\'t just scale\\nboth sides by some number, looks like he did another operation. He probably looks like\\nhe\\'s adding or subtracting something to both sides, so let\\'s see how he could have gotten this right over here. So he took -4x plus 5y is equal to one. And it looks like from\\nthat he was able to get - 3x plus 7y is equal to zero. So let\\'s see what he had to do to do that. Let\\'s see, he would have had to, to go from -4x to -3x, he would have had to add an X, so I could just write\\nan X right over there. To go from 5y to 7y, he would have had to add 2y. So on the left-hand side,\\nhe would have to add X plus 2y. Notice we have an X plus\\n2y right over there. And on the right-hand side,\\nhe would have had to add or subtract a one, or add a negative one. Notice we see a negative\\none right over there. So what he essentially did is\\nhe added the left-hand sides of these two equations to\\nget this new left-hand side right over here, and he\\nadded the right-hand sides to get this new right-hand side. And that is a legitimate operation. This new equation that you got, this new linear equation,\\nit\\'s going to represent a different line than\\nthis one right over here, but the resulting system is\\ngoing to have the same solution. Why do we feel confident\\nthat the resulting system is going to have the same solution? Well for an X-Y pair that\\nsatisfies both of these equations, that\\'s what a solution would be, for that X-Y pair, X plus 2y is equal to negative one. So for that solution, we\\'re adding the same thing to both sides. We\\'re saying: \"Look,\\nI\\'m gonna add X plus 2y \"to the left-hand side. \"Well if I don\\'t wanna\\nchange the solution, \"I have to add the same thing\\nto the right-hand side.\" Well they\\'re telling us for\\nthe solution to this equation, X plus 2y is equal to negative one, so negative one is the\\nsame thing as X plus 2y for that solution, so\\nwe\\'re not gonna change the resulting solution of the system, so it\\'s a completely legitimate\\noperation what Vivek did is adding the left-hand sides and adding the right-hand sides to get this new second equation. That\\'s not going to change\\nthe solution of the system. In fact, that\\'s a technique we often use to eventually find the\\nsolution of a system. So now let\\'s look at Camila, or Camila. So her first equation is\\nactually the exact same equation as the teacher\\'s second equation. Now let\\'s see, her second equation, how does it relate possibly\\nto the first equation? So just looking at it offhand, it looks like it might just be, it looks like she just multiplied\\nboth sides times a number. And it looks like that\\nnumber, she clearly multiplied the right-hand side times negative eight. So times negative eight. Negative one times negative\\neight is positive eight. And it looks like she also multiplied the left-hand side by negative eight. Negative eight times X is -8X. Negative eight times 2y is -16y. So she just multiplied both\\nsides by the same value which actually doesn\\'t\\nchange the equation. This actually is going to be-- It changes it the way it looks, but it actually represents the same line. So this is definitely\\nstill an equivalent system. These are still the same constraints. You\\'re going to have the same solution. Whenever you\\'re dealing with systems, you\\'re not going to change\\nthe solution of the system as long as you either multiply\\nboth sides of an equation by a scaler, or you are adding\\nand subtracting the equations. When I say add or subtract the equations, you\\'re adding the left-hand\\nside to the left-hand side, adding the right-hand side\\nto the right-hand side like we had here, or subtracting\\nthe one from the other on the left-hand side and\\nif we subtract the bottom from the top on the left-hand and we subtract the bottom\\nfrom the top on the right-hand, it\\'s not going to change our solution. So both of them obtained a\\nsystem that is equivalent, meaning that it has the same solution as the teacher\\'s system. '),\n",

       "  \"- Scarlett and Hansol's teacher gave them a system of linear equations to solve. They each took a few steps that lead to the systems shown in the table below. So this is the teacher system. This is what Scarlett got\\nafter taking some steps. This is what Hansol got. Which of them obtained a system that is equivalent to\\nthe teacher's system? And just to remind ourselves, an equivalent system is a system that has, or at least for our purposes, is a system that has the same solution, or the same solution set. So if there is a certain xy that satisfies this system in order for Scarlett's\\nsystem to be equivalent it needs to have the same solution. So let's look at this. So Scarlett, let's see, let's see if we can match these up. So her second equation here, so this is interesting, her second equation 14x - 7y = 2 over here the teacher has an equation 14x - 7y = 7. So this is interesting because the ratio between x and y is the same, but then your constant term, the constant term is\\ngoing to be different. And I would make the claim that this alone tells you\\nthat Scarlett's system is not equivalent to the teacher. And you're saying, well,\\nhow can I say that? Well, these two equations if you were to write them into slope intercept form, you would see because the ratio between x and y, the x\\nand y terms is the same. You're going to have the same slope, but you're going to have\\ndifferent Y intercepts. In fact, we can actually solve for that. So this equation right over here we can write it as if we, let's see, if we subtract 14x from both sides you get -7y - 14, woops, -7y =, is equal to -14x + 7 and we could divide both sides by -7. You get y = 2x -1 so that's this... All I did is algebraically\\nmanipulate this. This is this line and I could even try to graph it so let's do that. So I'll draw a quick coordinate. This is just going to be very rough. Quick coordinate axis right over there, and then this line, this line would look something like this. So its y intercept is -1\\nand it has a slope of 2. So let me draw a line with a slope of, a line with a slope of 2 might look something like that. So that's this line right over here or this one right over there, and let's see. This one over here is going to be, if we do the same algebra, we're going to have - 7y = -14x + 2, or y = , I'm just\\ndividing everything by -7, 2x - 2/7 so this is going to look\\nsomething like this. Its y intercept is -2/7 so\\nit's like right over there. So this line is going\\nto look something like, I'm going to draw my best, my best attempt at drawing it, it's going to look something... Actually that's not quite right. It's going to look something like... I'll actually just start\\nit right over here. It's going to look something like, something like this. It's going to have the same slope, and obviously it goes in\\nthis direction as well. Actually, let me just draw that. So it's going to have the same slope, but at different y intercepts. That doesn't look right,\\nbut you get the idea. These two lines are parallel. So these two lines are parallel so any coordinate that satisfies this one is not going to satisfy this one. They have no points in common. They are parallel. That's the definition of parallel. Since this and this have\\nno points in common, there's no way that some solution set that satisfies this would satisfy this 'cause any xy that satisfies this can't satisfy this or vice versa. They're parallel. There are no points. These two things will never intersect. So Scarlett does not have\\nan equivalent system. Now what about Hansol? Well, we see Hansol has the same thing going on here. 5x - y, 5x - y, but then the constant term is different, -6, positive 3. So this and this also\\nrepresent parallel lines. Any xy pair that satisfies this, there's no way that it's\\ngoing to satisfy this. These two lines don't intersect. They are parallel. So Hansol's system is\\nnot equivalent either. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Sal] In a previous video, we talk about the notion of\\nequivalence with equations. And equivalence is just this notion that there's different ways of writing what our equivalent statements in algebra. And I can give some simple examples. I could say two x equals 10,\\nor I could say x equals five. These are equivalent equations. Why are they? Because an x satisfies one of them if and only if it satisfies the other. And you can verify that in both cases, x equals five is the only\\nx that satisfies both. Another set of equivalent\\nequations, you could have two x is equal to eight and x equals four. These two are equivalent equations. An x satisfies one if and only\\nif it satisfies the other. In this video, we're going\\nto extend our knowledge of equivalence to thinking\\nabout equivalent systems. And really, in your past\\nwhen you were solving systems of equations,\\nyou were doing operations assuming equivalence, but you might not have just been thinking about it that way. So let's give ourselves a system. So let's say this system tells us that there's some x y pair\\nwhere two times that x plus that y is equal to eight, and that x plus that y is equal to five. Now we can have an equivalent system if we replace either of these equations with an equivalent version. So for example, many of you when you look to try to solve this, you might say well, if this was a negative two x here, maybe I could eventually\\nadd the left side. And we'll talk about why that is an equivalence preserving operation. But in order to get a\\nnegative two out here, you'd have to multiply\\nthis entire equation times negative two. And so if you did that, if you\\nmultiplied both sides of this times negative two, times negative two, what you're going to get is negative two x minus two y is equal to negative 10. This equation and this\\nequation are equivalent. Why? Because any x y pair that\\nsatisfies one of them will satisfy the other, or\\nan x y pair satisfies one if and only if it satisfies the other. And so if I now think about the system, the system where I've\\nrewritten this second equation and my first equation is the same, this is an equivalent\\nsystem to our first system. So these, any x y pair, if an x y pair satisfies one of these systems, it's going to satisfy\\nthe other and vice versa. Now the next interesting\\nthing that you might realize, and if you were just trying to solve this, and this isn't an introductory\\nvideo in solving systems, so I'm assuming some familiarity with it, you've probably seen\\nsolving by elimination where you say okay, look,\\nif I can somehow add these, the left side to the left\\nside and the right side to the right side, these\\nx's will quote cancel out and then I'll just be left with y's. And we've done this before. You can kind of think you're\\ntrying to solve for y. But in this video, I\\nwant to think about why you end up with an equivalent system if you were to do that. And one way to think about it is what I'm going to do to create\\nan equivalent system here is I am going to keep my first equation, two x plus y is equal to eight. But then I'm gonna take my second equation and add the same thing to both sides. We know if you add or\\nsubtract the same thing to both sides of an equation, you get an equivalent equation. So I'm gonna do that over here. But it's gonna be a\\nlittle bit interesting. So if you had negative two x minus two y is equal to negative 10,\\nand what I want to do is I want to add eight to both sides. So I could do it like this. I could add eight to both sides. But remember, our system\\nis saying that both of these statements are true, that two x plus y is equal to eight and negative two x minus two\\ny is equal to negative 10. So instead of adding\\nexplicitly eight to both sides, I could add something that's equivalent to eight to both sides. And I know something that\\nis equivalent to eight based on this first equation. I could add eight, and I could do eight on the left hand side, or I\\ncould just add two x plus y. So two x plus y. Now I really want you, you\\nmight want to pause your video and say okay, how can I do this? Why is Sal saying that I'm adding the same thing to both sides? Because remember, when\\nwe're taking a system, we're assuming that both\\nof these need to be true. An x y pair satisfies one\\nequation if and only if, only if, if and only if\\nit satisfies the other. So here, we know that x, two x plus y needs to be equal to eight. So if I'm adding two x plus y to the left and I'm adding eight to the right, I'm really just adding\\neight to both sides, which is equivalence preserving. And when you do that, you\\nget, these negative two x and two x cancels out, you get negative y is equal to negative two. And so I can rewrite that second equation as negative y is equal to negative two. And I know what you're thinking. You're like wait, but I'm used to solving systems of equations. I'm used to just adding these two together and then I just have this one equation. And really, that's not super\\nmathematically rigorous because the other equation is still there. It's still a constraint. Oftentimes, you solve for one and then you quote substitute back in. But really, the both equations\\nare there the whole time. You're just rewriting\\nthem in equivalent ways. So once again, this system, this system, and this system are all equivalent. Any x y pair that\\nsatisfies one will satisfy all of them, and vice versa. And once again, we can continue to rewrite this in equivalent ways. That second equation, I can multiply both sides by negative one. That's equivalence preserving. And if I did that, then\\nI get, I haven't changed my top equation, two x\\nplus y is equal to eight. And on the second one,\\nif I multiply both sides by negative one, I get y is equal to two. Once again, these are\\nall equivalent systems. I know I'm, I sound\\nvery repetitive in this. But now, I can do another\\nthing to make this, to keep the equivalence\\nbut get a clearer idea of what that x y pair is. If we know that y is equal to two and we know that that's\\ntrue in both equations, remember, it is an and here. We're assuming there's x y, some x y pair that satisfies both. Two x plus y needs to be equal to eight and y is equal to two. Well that means up here where we see a y, we can write an equivalent system where instead of writing a y there, we could write a two because\\nwe know that y is equal to two. And so we can rewrite that top equation by substituting a two for y. So we could rewrite that as two\\nx plus two is equal to eight and y is equal to two. So this is an and right over there. It's implicitly there. And of course, we can\\nkeep going from there. I'll scroll down a little bit. I could write another\\nequivalent system to this by doing equivalence preserving operations on that top equation. What if I subtracted two from both sides of that top equation? It's still going to be\\nan equivalent equation. And so I could rewrite\\nit as, if I subtract two from both sides, I'm gonna\\nget two x is equal to six. And then that second\\nequation hasn't changed. Y is equal to two. So there's some x y pair\\nthat if it satisfies one, it satisfies the other, and vice versa. This system is equivalent to every system that I've written so far in\\nthis chain of operations, so to speak, and then of\\ncourse, this top equation, an equivalence preserving operation is to divide both sides by a non, the same nonzero value. And in this case, I could\\ndivide both sides by two. And then I would get, if\\nI divide the top by two, I would get x equals three,\\nand y is equal to two. And once again, this is a different way of thinking about it. All I'm doing is rewriting the same system in an equivalent way that just\\ngets us a little bit clearer as to what that x y pair actually is. In the past, you might've just, you know, just assumed that you can\\nadd both sides of an equation or do this type of elimination or do some type of substitution to just quote figure out the x and y. But really, you're rewriting the system. You're rewriting the\\nconstraints of the system in equivalent ways to\\nmake it more explicit what that x y pair is that satisfies both equations in the system. \"),\n",

And he\\'s starting to feel a little bit jealous \\'cause he\\'s supposed to be the wise man in the kingdom, the king\\'s closest advisor. So he steps in and says, \"okay, so if you and this bird\" \"are so smart, how about you tackle the Riddle of the Fruit Prices?\" And the king says, \"Yes, that is something that we haven\\'t been able to figure out.\" \"The fruit prices. Arbegla, tell them the riddle of the fruit prices.\" And so Arbegla says, \"Well,\" \"we wanna keep track of how much our fruit costs, but we forgot\" \"to actually log how much it costs when we went to the market but we know how much in total we spent\" \"we know much we got. We know that one week ago, when we went to\" \"the fruit market, we bought two, two, pounds of\" \"apples, we bought two pounds of apples, and one pound of bananas.\" \"one pound, I guess, of bananans, bananas. And the total cost\" \"that, time, was three dollars, so there was three dollars, three dollars\" in total cost. And then when we went the time before that we went the time before that we bought six pounds of bananas or six pounds of apples I should say Six pounds of apples. And three pounds three pounds of bananas. Ba-nanas. And the total cost at that point was fifteen dollars. So what is the cost of apples and bananas? So you look at the bird: The bird looks at you, the bird whispers into the king\\'s ear, and the king says Well the bird says we\\'ll just start defining some variables here, so we\\'ll start expressing this thing algebraically So you go about doing that. What we want to figure out is the cost of apples and the cost of bananas. Per pound. So we set some variables. So let\\'s... let a= the cost cost of apples, apple per pound. Per pound And let\\'s let b = the cost of bananas. Ba-nanas. Bananas per pound. So how could we interpret this first information right here? Two pounds of apples and a pound of bananas cost $3. So how much are the apples going to cost? Well it\\'s going to cost 2, two pounds times the cost per pound, times a, that\\'s going to be the total cost of apples in this scenarios, and what\\'s the total cost of the banana? Well it\\'s one pound times the cost per pound. So, you\\'re just going to have b, that\\'s the total cost of the bananas, cause we know we bought one the total cost of the apples and bananas are going to be 2a+b and we know what that total cost is it is, it is $3. Now let\\'s do the same thing for the other time we went to the market. Simply Six pounds of apple, the total cost is going to be six pounds times A dollars per pound and the total cost of banas is going to be well we bought three poiund of bananas. and the cost per pound is b and so the total cost of apples and bananas this scenario is going to be = to 15 is going to be = to $15 so let\\'s think about how we might want to solve it we could use elimination we could use substitution whatever we want, we might do it graphically let\\'s try it first with elimination. so the first thing I might want to do is is maybe I want to eliminate let\\'s say I want to eliminate the a variable right over here so I have two a over here, I have six a over here so if I multiply this entire right equation by -3 then this 2a would become a -6a and then it might be able to cancel out with that so let me do that let me multiply this entire equation times -3 times negative three so -3 * 2a is -6a -3 * b is -3b and then -3 * 3 is -9 is -9 and now we can essentially add the two equations or essentially add the left side of this to the left side of that or the right side of this equation to the right side of that we\\'re essentially adding the same thing to both sides of this equation because we know this is equal to that So let\\'s do that let\\'s do it So on the left hand side, 6a and 6a cancel out. But something else interesting happens, the 3b and the 3b cancels out as well. So we\\'re just left with 0 on the left hand side. And on the right hand side, what do we have? 15 - 9 = 6. So we get this bizarre statement! All of our variables have gone away And we\\'re left with this bizarre nonsensical statement that 0 = 6, which we know is definitely not the case. So what\\'s going on over here? What\\'s going on? And then, you you you say, what\\'s going on and you look at the bird \\'cause the bird seems to be the most knowledgeable person in the room or at least the most knowledgeable vertebrate in the room. And so the bird whispers into the king\\'s ear and the king says, \"Well, he says that there\\'s no solution and you should at least try to graph it to see why.\" And you say, well, the bird seems to know what he\\'s talking about So let me attempt to graph these two equations and see what\\'s going on. And so what you do is, you take each of the equation and you like, when you graph it, you like to put it in kind of the y-intercept form or slope intercept form and so you do that, so you say, well let me solve both of these for b so if you want to solve this first equation for b you just subtract 2a from both sides if you subtract 2a from both sides of this first equation you get b is = to -2a + 3. Now solve this second equation for b. So the first thing you might wanna do is subtract 6a from both sides. So you would get, you would get, I\\'ll do it right over, let me do it right over here. You would get 3b, 3b is = to -6a plus 15 and then you can divide both sides by 3 you get b is = to -2a plus, plus 5. So the second equation, let me revert back to that other shade of green, is b is = to -2a plus 5. And we haven\\'t even graphed it yet, but it looks like something interesting is going on. They both have the exact same slope when you solve in terms, when you solve for b but they seem to have different, let\\'s call them, b-intercepts let\\'s graph it to actually see what\\'s going on so let me get, draw some axes over here, let\\'s call that my b-axis and then this could be my, a axis And this first equation has a b-intercept of positive 3 so let\\'s see, one, two, three four five the first one has a b-intercept of positive three and it has a slope of negative 2 So you go down or you go to the right one you go down two. Go to the right one, you go down two. So the line looks something like this. I\\'m trying my best to draw it straight. So it looks it looks something something like that And I\\'ll just draw this green one. This green one, our b-intercept is 5 so it\\'s right over here. but we have the exact same slope the slope of -2, so it looks it looks something something like that right over there and you immediately see now that the bird was right There is no solution because these two constraints represent or can be represented by lines that don\\'t intersect. So the lines don\\'t, don\\'t intersect. In-ter-sect. They don\\'t intersect, and so the bird is right there\\'s no solution, there\\'s no x and y that can make this statement equal true! Or that can make 0 = 6, there is no possible, there is no overlap between these two things. And so something gets into your brain. You realize that Arbegla is trying to stump you. And you say, Arbegla, you have given me in-con-sistent information! This is an in-con-sistent system of equations! In. In...con...sistent. Which happens to be the word that is sometimes used to refer to a system that has no solutions, where the lines do not intersect. And there fore this information is incorrect We cannot assume that the apple or banana Either you are lying, which is possible, or you accounted for it wrong Or maybe the prices of apples and bananas actually changed between the two visits of the market. At which point the bird whispered into the King\\'s ear, and says, oh, this character isn\\'t so bad at this algebra stuff. '),\n",

       "  \"Arbegla starts to feel\\nangry and embarrassed that he was shown up by you and\\nthe bird in front of the King and so he storms\\nout of the room. And then a few seconds\\nlater he storms back in. He says, my fault. My apologies. I realize now what\\nthe mistake was. There was a slight, I guess,\\ntyping error or writing error. In the first week, when\\nthey went to the market and bought two pounds of apples\\nand one pound of bananas, it wasn't a $3 cost. It was a $5 cost. Now surely considering how smart\\nyou and this bird seem to be, you surely could figure out what\\nis the per pound cost of apples and what is the per\\npound cost of bananas. So you think for a\\nlittle bit, is there now going to be a solution? So let's break it down using\\nthe exact same variables. You say, well if a is the\\ncost of apples per pound and b is the cost of bananas,\\nthis first constraint tells us that two pounds of apples\\nare going to cost 2a, because it's b\\ndollars per pound. And one pound of\\nbananas is going to cost b dollars because\\nit's one pound times b dollars per pound is\\nnow going to cost $5. This is the corrected number. And we saw from\\nthe last scenario, this information hasn't changed. Six pounds of apples is\\ngoing to cost 6a, six pounds times a\\ndollars per pound. And three pounds of bananas is\\ngoing to cost 3b, three pounds times b dollars per pound. The total cost of the\\napples and bananas in this trip we\\nare given is $15. So once again, you\\nsay, well let me try to solve this maybe\\nthrough elimination. And once again, you say well\\nlet me cancel out the a's. I have 2a here. I have 6a here. If I multiply the 2a\\nhere by negative 3, then this will\\nbecome a negative 6a. And it might be able to cancel\\nout with all of this business. So you do that. You multiply this\\nentire equation. You can't just\\nmultiply one term. You have to multiply the entire\\nequation times negative 3 if you want the\\nequation to still hold. And so we're multiplying\\nby negative 3 so 2a times negative\\n3 is negative 6a. b times negative\\n3 is negative 3b. And then 5 times negative\\n3 is negative 15. And now something\\nfishy starts to look like it's about to happen. Because when you\\nadd the left hand side of this blue equation\\nor this purplish equation to the green one, you get 0. All of these things right\\nover here just cancel out. And on the right hand\\nside, 15 minus 15, that is also equal to 0. And you get 0 equals 0, which\\nseems a little bit better than the last time\\nyou worked through it. Last time we got 0 equals 6. But 0 equals 0 doesn't really\\ntell you anything about the x's and y's. This is true. This is absolutely true that\\n0 does definitely equals 0, but it doesn't tell you any\\ninformation about x and y. And so then the bird\\nwhispers in the King's ear, and then the King\\nsays, well the bird says you should graph\\nit to figure out what's actually going on. And so you've learned\\nthat listening to the bird actually makes a lot of sense. So you try to graph\\nthese two constraints. So let's do it the same way. We'll have a b axis. That's our b axis. And we will have our a axis. Let we mark off some markers\\nhere-- one, two, three, four, five and one, two,\\nthree, four, five. So this first equation\\nright over here, if we subtract 2a\\nfrom both sides, I'm just going to put it\\ninto slope intercept form, you get b is equal to\\nnegative 2a plus 5. All I did is subtract\\n2a from both sides. And if we were to graph\\nthat, our b-intercept when a is equal to 0,\\nb is equal to 5. So that's right over here. And our slope is negative 2. Every time you add 1 to a--\\nso if a goes from 0 to 1-- b is going to go down by 2. So go down by two, go down by 2. So this first white\\nequation looks like this if we graph the solution set. These are all of the prices\\nfor bananas and apples that meet this constraint. Now let's graph this\\nsecond equation. If we subtract 6a\\nfrom both sides, we get 3b is equal to\\nnegative 6a plus 15. And now we could divide\\nboth sides by 3, divide everything by 3. We are left with b is equal\\nto negative 2a plus 5. Well this is interesting. This looks very similar, or\\nit looks exactly the same. Our b-intercept is 5 and\\nour slope is negative 2a. So this is essentially\\nthe same line. So these are essentially\\nthe same constraints. And so you start to look at\\nit a little bit confused, and you say, OK, I see\\nwhy we got 0 equals 0. There's actually an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. You pick any x and then\\nthe corresponding y for each of these\\ncould be a solution for either of these things. So there's an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. But you start to wonder,\\nwhy is this happening? And so the bird whispers\\nagain into the King's ear and the King says,\\nwell the bird says this is because in both\\ntrips to the market the same ratio of apples\\nand bananas was bought. In the green trip\\nversus the white trip, you bought three times as many\\napples, bought three times as many bananas, and you\\nhad three times the cost. So in any situation for any\\nper pound prices of apples and bananas, if you\\nbuy exactly three times the number of apples, three\\ntimes the number bananas, and have three\\ntimes the cost, that could be true for any prices. And so this is actually\\nit's consistent. We can't say that\\nArbegla is lying to us, but it's not giving\\nus enough information. This is what we call, this\\nis a consistent system. It's consistent\\ninformation here. So let me write this down. This is consistent. And it is consistent,\\n0 equals 0. There's no shadiness\\ngoing on here. But it's not enough information. This system of\\nequations is dependent. It is dependent. And you have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. Any point this line\\nrepresents a solution. So you tell Arbegla,\\nwell, if you really want us to figure\\nthis out, you need to give us more information. And preferably buy a different\\nratio of apples to bananas. \"),\n",

       "  \"Is the system of\\nlinear equations below consistent or inconsistent? And they give us x\\nplus 2y is equal to 13 and 3x minus y is\\nequal to negative 11. So to answer this\\nquestion, we need to know what it means to be\\nconsistent or inconsistent. So a consistent\\nsystem of equations. has at least one solution. And an inconsistent system of\\nequations, as you can imagine, has no solutions. So if we think about\\nit graphically, what would the graph of a\\nconsistent system look like? Let me just draw a\\nreally rough graph. So that's my x-axis,\\nand that is my y-axis. So if I have just two\\ndifferent lines that intersect, that would be consistent. So that's one line, and\\nthen that's another line. They clearly have\\nthat one solution where they both\\nintersect, so that would be a consistent system. Another consistent\\nsystem would be if they're the same\\nline, because then they would intersect at\\na ton of points, actually at an infinite\\nnumber of points. So let's say one of the\\nlines looks like that. And then the other line is\\nactually the exact same line. So it's exactly\\nright on top of it. So those two intersect at\\nevery point along those lines, so that also would\\nbe consistent. An inconsistent system\\nwould have no solutions. So let me again draw my axes. Let me once again draw my axes. It will have no solutions. And so the only way\\nthat you're going to have two lines\\nin two dimensions have no solutions is if\\nthey don't intersect, or if they are parallel. So one line could\\nlook like this. And then the other line\\nwould have the same slope, but it would be shifted over. It would have a\\ndifferent y-intercept, so it would look like this. So that's what an inconsistent\\nsystem would look like. You have parallel lines. This right here is inconsistent. So what we could do is\\njust do a rough graph of both of these lines\\nand see if they intersect. Another way to do it is,\\nyou could look at the slope. And if they have the same slope\\nand different y-intercepts, then you'd also have\\nan inconsistent system. But let's just graph them. So let me draw my x-axis\\nand let me draw my y-axis. So this is x and then this is y. And then there's a couple\\nof ways we could do it. The easiest way is really\\njust find two points on each of these that satisfy\\neach of these equations, and that's enough\\nto define a line. So for this first one, let's\\njust make a little table of x's and y's. When x is 0, you have\\n2y is equal to 13, or y is equal to 13/2, which\\nis the same thing as 6 and 1/2. So when x is 0, y is 6 and 1/2. I'll just put it\\nright over here. So this is 0 comma 13/2. And then let's just see\\nwhat happens when y is 0. When y is 0, then\\n2 times y is 0. You have x equaling 13. x equals 13. So we have the point 13 comma 0. So this is 0, 6 and\\n1/2, so 13 comma 0 would be right about there. We're just trying to\\napproximate-- 13 comma 0. And so this line right\\nup here, this equation can be represented by this line. Let me try my best to draw it. It would look\\nsomething like that. Now let's worry about this one. Let's worry about that one. So once again, let's make a\\nlittle table, x's and y's. I'm really just looking for\\ntwo points on this graph. So when x is equal to\\n0, 3 times 0 is just 0. So you get negative y\\nis equal to negative 11, or you get y is equal to 11. So you have the point 0, 11, so\\nthat's maybe right over there. 0 comma 11 is on that line. And then when y is 0,\\nyou have 3x minus 0 is equal to negative 11, or\\n3x is equal to negative 11. Or if you divide\\nboth sides by 3, you get x is equal\\nto negative 11/3. And this is the exact same\\nthing as negative 3 and 2/3. So when y is 0, you have x\\nbeing negative 3 and 2/3. So maybe this is about\\n6, so negative 3 and 2/3 would be right about here. So this is the point\\nnegative 11/3 comma 0. And so the second equation will\\nlook like something like this. Will look something like that. Now clearly-- and I might have\\nnot been completely precise when I did this hand-drawn\\ngraph-- clearly these two guys intersect. They intersect right over here. And to answer\\ntheir question, you don't even have to find the\\npoint that they intersect at. We just have to\\nsee, very clearly, that these two lines intersect. So this is a consistent\\nsystem of equations. It has one solution. You just have to have at least\\none in order to be consistent. So once again, consistent\\nsystem of equations. \"),\n",

       "  \"Is the system of\\nlinear equations below dependent or independent? And they give us two\\nequations right here. And before I tackle\\nthis specific problem, let's just do a little\\nbit a review of what dependent or independent means. And actually, I'll compare that\\nto consistent and inconsistent. So just to start\\noff with, if we're dealing with systems of linear\\nequations in two dimensions, there's only three possibilities\\nthat the lines or the equations can have relative to each other. So let me draw the\\nthree possibilities. So let me draw three\\ncoordinate axes. So that's my first\\nx-axis and y-axis. Let me draw another one. That is x and that is y. Let me draw one\\nmore, because there's only three possibilities\\nin two dimensions. x and y if we're dealing\\nwith linear equations. So you can have the situation\\nwhere the lines just intersect in one point. Let me do this. So you could have\\none line like that and maybe the other line\\ndoes something like that and they intersect at one point. You could have the\\nsituation where the two lines are parallel. So you could have a situation--\\nactually let me draw it over here-- where you have one\\nline that goes like that and the other line has the\\nsame slope but it's shifted. It has a different y-intercept,\\nso maybe it looks like this. And you have no points\\nof intersection. And then you could\\nhave the situation where they're actually the same\\nline, so that both lines have the same slope and\\nthe same y-intercept. So really they\\nare the same line. They intersect on an\\ninfinite number of points. Every point on\\neither of those lines is also a point\\non the other line. So just to give you a little\\nbit of the terminology here, and we learned this in the\\nlast video, this type of system where they don't intersect,\\nwhere you have no solutions, this is an inconsistent system. And by definition, or\\nI guess just taking the opposite of\\ninconsistent, both of these would be considered consistent. But then within consistent,\\nthere's obviously a difference. Here we only have one solution. These are two different lines\\nthat intersect in one place. And here they're essentially\\nthe same exact line. And so we differentiate\\nbetween these two scenarios by calling this one\\nover here independent and this one over\\nhere dependent. So independent-- both lines\\nare doing their own thing. They're not dependent\\non each other. They're not the same line. They will intersect\\nat one place. Dependent-- they're\\nthe exact same line. Any point that satisfies one\\nline will satisfy the other. Any points that\\nsatisfies one equation will satisfy the other. So with that said, let's see if\\nthis system of linear equations right here is dependent\\nor independent. So they're kind of\\nhaving us assume that it's going\\nto be consistent, that we're going to\\nintersect in one place or going to intersect in an\\ninfinite number of places. And the easiest way to\\ndo this-- we already have this second equation here. It's already in\\nslope-intercept form. We know the slope is negative\\n2, the y-intercept is 8. Let's put this first equation\\nup here in slope-intercept form and see if it has a different\\nslope or a different intercept. Or maybe it's the same line. So we have 4x plus\\n2y is equal to 16. We can subtract 4x\\nfrom both sides. What we want to do is isolate\\nthe y on the left hand side. So let's subtract\\n4x from both sides. The left hand side-- we\\nare just left with a 2y. And then the right hand side,\\nwe have a negative 4x plus 16. I just wrote the negative\\n4 in front of the 16, just so that we have it in the\\ntraditional slope-intercept form. And now we can divide both\\nsides of this equation by 2, so that we can isolate\\nthe y on the left hand side. Divide both sides by 2. We are left with y is equal\\nto negative 4 divided by 2 is negative 2x plus\\n16 over 2 plus 8. So all I did is algebraically\\nmanipulate this top equation up here. And when I did that, when\\nI solved essentially for y, I got this right\\nover here, which is the exact same thing\\nas the second equation. We have the exact same slope,\\nnegative 2, negative 2, and we have the exact\\nsame y-intercept, 8 and 8. If I were to graph these\\nequations-- that's my x-axis, and that is my y-axis-- both\\nof them have a y-intercept at 8 and then have a\\nslope of negative 2. So they look\\nsomething-- I'm just drawing an approximation of it--\\nbut they would look something like that. So maybe this is the graph\\nof this equation right here, this first equation. And then the second equation\\nwill be the exact same graph. It has the exact\\nsame y-intercept and the exact same slope. So clearly these two\\nlines are dependent. They have an infinite\\nnumber of points that are common to both of them,\\nbecause they're the same line. \"),\n",

       "  \"We're told to look at the\\ncoordinate grid above. I put it on the side here. Identify one system\\nof two lines that has a single solution. Then identify one system\\nof two lines that does not have a solution. So let's do the first part\\nfirst. So a single solution. And they say identify one\\nsystem, but we can see here there's actually going to\\nbe two systems that have a single solution. And when we talk about a single\\nsolution, we're talking about a single x and y value\\nthat will satisfy both equations in the system. So if we look right here at the\\npoints of intersection, this point right there, that\\nsatisfies this equation y is equal to 0.1x plus 1. And it also satisfies, well,\\nthis blue line, but the graph that that line represents,\\ny is equal to 4x plus 10. So this dot right here, that\\npoint represents a solution to both of these. Or I guess another way to think\\nabout it, it represents an x and y value that satisfy\\nboth of these constraints. So one system that has one\\nsolution is the system that has y is equal to 0.1x plus 1,\\nand then this blue line right here, which is y is equal\\nto 4x plus 10. Now, they only want us to\\nidentify one system of two lines that has a single\\nsolution. We've already done that. But just so you see it, there's\\nactually another system here. So this is one system right\\nhere, or another system would be the green line and\\nthis red line. This point of intersection right\\nhere, once again, that represents an x and y value\\nthat satisfies both the equation y is equal to 0.1x plus\\n1, and this point right here satisfies the equation\\ny is equal to 4x minus 6. So if you look at this system,\\nthere's one solution, because there's one point of\\nintersection of these two equations or these two lines,\\nand this system also has one solution because it has one\\npoint of intersection. Now, the second part of the\\nproblem, they say identify one system of two lines that does\\nnot have a single solution or does not have a solution,\\nso no solution. So in order for there to be no\\nsolution, that means that the two constraints don't overlap,\\nthat there's no point that is common to both equations or\\nthere's no pair of x, y values that's common to\\nboth equations. And that's the case of the two\\nparallel lines here, this blue line and this green line. Because they never intersect,\\nthere's no coordinate on the coordinate plane that satisfies\\nboth equations. So there's no x and y\\nthat satisfy both. So the second part of the\\nquestion, a system that has no solution is y is equal to 4x\\nplus 10, and then the other one is y is equal\\nto 4x minus 6. And notice, they have the exact\\nsame slope, and they're two different lines, they have\\ndifferent intercepts, so they never, ever intersect,\\nand that's why they have no solutions. \"),\n",

       "  \"So that we don't get stumped\\nby the Arbeglas in our life and especially when we don't\\nhave talking birds to help us, we should be able to\\nidentify when things get a little bit weird with\\nour systems of equations. When we have scenarios that have\\nan infinite number of solutions or that have no\\nsolutions at all. And just as a little bit of a\\nreview of what could happen, these are the-- think\\nabout the three scenarios. You have the first\\nscenario which is kind of where we started off,\\nwhere you have two systems that just intersect in one place. And then you have\\nessentially one solution. So if you were to\\ngraphically represent it you have one solution right\\nover there, one solution. And this means that the two\\nconstraints are consistent and the two constraints are\\nindependent of each other. They're not the exact same line,\\nconsistent and independent. Then you have the other scenario\\nwhere they're consistent, they intersect,but they're\\nessentially the same line. They intersect everywhere. So this is one of the\\nconstraints for one of the equations,\\nand the other one if you look at it,\\nif you graph it, it is actually the\\nexact same one. So here you have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. It's consistent, you\\ndo have solutions here, but they're dependent equations. It's a dependent system. And then the last\\nscenario, and this is when you're dealing\\nin two dimensions, the last scenario is where\\nyour two constraints just don't intersect with each other. One might look like\\nthis, and then the other might look like this. They have the exact\\nsame slope but they have different intercepts. So this there is no solution,\\nthey never intersect. And we call this an\\ninconsistent system. And if you wanted to think\\nabout what would happen just think about what's\\ngoing on here. Here you have different slopes. And if you think about\\nit, two different lines with different\\nslopes are definitely going to intersect\\nin exactly one place. Here they have the same\\nslope and same y-intercept, so you have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. Here you have the same slope\\nbut different y-intercepts, and you get no solutions. So the times when\\nyou're solving systems where things are going\\nto get a little bit weird are when you have\\nthe same slope. And if you think about it,\\nwhat defines the slope, and I encourage you to test this\\nout with different equations, is when you have-- if you\\nhave your x's and y's, or you have your a's and b's or\\nyou have your variables on the same side of\\nan equation, where they have the same ratio\\nwith respect to each other. So with that, kind of\\nkeeping that in mind, let's see if we can think\\nabout what types of solutions we might find. So let's take this down. So they say determine\\nhow many solutions exist for the\\nsystem of equations. So you have 10x minus\\n2y is equal to 4, and 10x minus 2y is equal to 16. So just based on what we\\njust talked about the x's and the y's are on the\\nsame side of the equation and the ratio is\\n10 to negative 2. Same ratio. So something strange is\\ngoing to happen here. But when we have the\\nsame kind of combination of x's and y's in the first one\\nwe get 4, and on the second one we get 16. So that seems a\\nlittle bit bizarre. Another way to\\nthink about it, we have the same number of\\nx's, the same number of y's but we got a different number\\non the right hand side. So if you were to simplify\\nthis, and we could even look at the hints\\nto see what it says, you'll see that\\nyou're going to end up with the same slope but\\ndifferent y-intercepts. So we convert both the slope\\nintercept form right over here and you see one, the blue one\\nis y is equal to 5x minus 2, and the green one is y\\nis equal to 5x minus 8. Same slope, same ratio\\nbetween the x's and the Y's, but you have different\\nvalues right over here. You have different y-intercepts. So here you have no solutions. That is this scenario right over\\nhere if you were to graph it. So no solutions,\\ncheck our answer. Let's go to the next question. So let's look at this\\none right over here. So we have negative 5 times\\nx and negative 1 times y. We have 4 times x and 1 times y. So it looks like the\\nratio if then we're looking at the x's and y's\\nalways on the left hand side right over here, it looks like\\nthe ratios of x's and y's are different. You have essentially\\n5 x's for every one y, or you could say negative 5\\nx's for every negative 1 y, and here you have 4\\nx's for every 1 y. So this is fundamentally\\na different ratio. So right off the bat\\nyou could say well these are going to intersect\\nin exactly one place. If you were to put this\\ninto slope intercept form, you will see that they\\nhave different slopes. So you could say\\nthis has one solution and you can check your answer. And you could look at the\\nsolution just to verify. And I encourage you to do this. So you see the blue one if you\\nput in the slope intercept form negative 5x plus 10 and\\nyou take the green one into slope intercept\\nform negative 4x minus 8. So different slopes,\\nthey're definitely going to intersect\\nin exactly one place. You're going to\\nhave one solution. Let's try another one. So here we have 2x plus\\ny is equal to negative 3. And this is pretty\\nclear, you have 2x plus y is equal\\nto negative 3. These are the exact\\nsame equations. So it's consistent information,\\nthere's definitely solutions. But there's an infinite number\\nof solutions right over here. This is a dependent system. So there are infinite\\nnumber of solutions here and we can check our answer. Let's do one more because that\\nwas a little bit too easy. OK so this is interesting\\nright over here, we have it in different forms. 2x plus y is equal\\nto negative 4, y is equal to\\nnegative 2x minus 4. So let's take this\\nfirst blue equation and put it into\\nslope intercept form. If we did that you would\\nget, if you just subtract 2x from both sides you get y is\\nequal to negative 2x minus 4, which is the exact same thing as\\nthis equation right over here. So once again they're\\nthe exact same equation. You have an infinite\\nnumber of solutions. Check our answer, and you can\\nlook at the solution right here. You convert the blue\\none into slope intercept and you get the exact\\nsame thing as what you saw in the green one. \"),\n",

algebraically\\xa0\\nso let's try to actually just solve\\xa0\\xa0 the system and see what we get so the\\xa0\\nfirst equation I'm going to leave that\\xa0\\xa0 unchanged 5x minus 9y is equal to\\xa0\\nis equal to is 16 now this second\\xa0\\xa0 equation right over here let's say I\\xa0\\nwant to cancel out the X terms so let me\\xa0\\xa0 multiply the second equation by negative\\xa0\\none so I have a negative 5x that I can\\xa0\\xa0 cancel out with the 5x so if I multiply\\xa0\\nthe second equation by negative one I'm\\xa0\\xa0 going to have negative 5x plus 9y plus\\xa0\\n9 Y is equal to negative 36 negative 36\\xa0\\xa0 now what I'm going to do is I'm going\\xa0\\nto add the left side of the equations\\xa0\\xa0 and the right sides of the equations to\\xa0\\nget a new equation so 5x minus 5x well\\xa0\\xa0 that's going to be 0 negative 9y plus 9y\\xa0\\nwell that's going to be 0 again I don't\\xa0\\xa0 even have to write it it's just going\\xa0\\nto be 0 on the left-hand side and on\\xa0\\xa0 the right-hand side I'm going to have\\xa0\\n16 minus 36 so negative 20 so now I'm\\xa0\\xa0 left with the somewhat bizarre-looking\\xa0\\nequation that says that 0 is equal to\\xa0\\xa0 negative 20 now one way you might say\\xa0\\nwell how does this make any sense and\\xa0\\xa0 the way to think about it is well are\\xa0\\nthere any X Y values 4 which is 0 is\\xa0\\xa0 going to be equal to negative 20 well no\\xa0\\n0 is never going to be equal to negative\\xa0\\xa0 20 and so it doesn't matter what X Y\\xa0\\nvalues you can never find an X well X or\\xa0\\xa0 XY pair that's going to make 0 equal to\\xa0\\nnegative 20 in fact the X's and Y's have\\xa0\\xa0 disappeared from this equation there's\\xa0\\nno way that this is going to be true so\\xa0\\xa0 we have no we have no solutions now if\\xa0\\nyou were to plot these if you were to\\xa0\\xa0 plot each of these lines you would see\\xa0\\nthat they are parallel lines and that's\\xa0\\xa0 why they have the same slope different\\xa0\\ny-intercepts and that's why we have no\\xa0\\xa0 solutions they don't intersect let's do\\xa0\\nanother one of these this is this is fun\\xa0\\xa0 all right how many solutions does the\\xa0\\nfollowing system of linear equations\\xa0\\xa0 have so let's do the same thing I'm\\xa0\\ngoing to keep the first equation the\\xa0\\xa0 same negative 6x plus 4y is equal to 2\\xa0\\nand the second equation let me just see\\xa0\\xa0 if I can cancel out the X term so if I\\xa0\\nhave a negative 6x if I multiply this by\\xa0\\xa0 2 I'm going to have a positive 6x so I\\xa0\\ncan let's see I'm going to multiply this\\xa0\\xa0 whole equation both sides of it by 2 so\\xa0\\nI'm going to have 6x 3 x times 2 is 6x\\xa0\\xa0 negative 2y times 2 is negative 4y and\\xa0\\nthat is going to be equal to negative\\xa0\\xa0 2 now let's do the same thing let's\\xa0\\nadd the left sides and let's add the\\xa0\\xa0 right sides so negative 6x plus 6x well\\xa0\\nthat's going to be 0 4y minus 4y that's\\xa0\\xa0 0 we just have a 0 on the left-hand\\xa0\\nside now on the right-hand side we\\xa0\\xa0 have 2 plus negative 2 well that's 0 so\\xa0\\nthis is a little bit different it still\\xa0\\xa0 looks a little bit bizarre 0 equals\\xa0\\n0 last time we had 0 is equal to we\\xa0\\xa0 add what 0 is equal to negative 20 now\\xa0\\nwe have 0 equals 0 so one way to think\\xa0\\xa0 about it is even though the X's and\\xa0\\nY's are no longer in this equation\\xa0\\xa0 okay well what XY pairs is it going to\\xa0\\nbe true for is that it's going to make\\xa0\\xa0 it true that 0 is equal to 0 well this\\xa0\\nis going to be true no matter what x and\\xa0\\xa0 y are in fact x and y are not involved\\xa0\\nin this equation anymore 0 is always\\xa0\\xa0 going to be equal to 0 so this is going\\xa0\\nto have an infinitely this is going to\\xa0\\xa0 have infinitely many solutions here and\\xa0\\nthat's because these are the same lines\\xa0\\xa0 they just look a little bit different\\xa0\\nalgebraically but if you scale one of\\xa0\\xa0 them in the right way in fact if you\\xa0\\njust multiply both sides of this one\\xa0\\xa0 the second one by negative 2 you're\\xa0\\ngoing to get the top one and so they\\xa0\\xa0 actually represent the exact same\\xa0\\nlines you have an infinitely many\\xa0\\xa0 solutions all right when trying to\\xa0\\nfind the solution to the following\\xa0\\xa0 system of linear equations Yvonne takes\\xa0\\nseveral correct steps that lead to the\\xa0\\xa0 equation negative 5 is equal to 20 how\\xa0\\nmany solutions is the system of linear\\xa0\\xa0 equations have I don't even have to\\xa0\\nlook at the system right over here\\xa0\\xa0 the fact that she got the statement\\xa0\\nthat can never be true negative 5 is\\xa0\\xa0 never going to be equal to 20 tells\\xa0\\nus that she has no those solutions\\xa0\\xa0 and once again if you were to plot\\xa0\\nthese graphically you would see that\\xa0\\xa0 these are parallel lines that's why they\\xa0\\nhave no solutions they never intersect\\xa0\\xa0 there's no XY pair that satisfies both\\xa0\\nof these constraints let's do a let's\\xa0\\xa0 do a couple more of these when trying\\xa0\\nto find the solution to the following\\xa0\\xa0 system of linear equations Alba's take\\xa0\\nseveral correct steps that lead to the\\xa0\\xa0 equation 5y is equal to negative 5 and\\xa0\\nsay how many solutions does this system\\xa0\\xa0 of linear equations have well 5y equals\\xa0\\nnegative 5 we could divide both sides\\xa0\\xa0 by 5 and we get Y is equal to negative\\xa0\\n1 and then if you substitute back in Y\\xa0\\xa0 is equal to negative 1 if you did it\\xa0\\nin this first equation if Y is equal\\xa0\\xa0 to negative 1 all of this becomes\\xa0\\npositive 2 you can subtract 2 from\\xa0\\xa0 both sides and you get 5x is equal to\\xa0\\n4 or you'd get what X is equal to 4/5\\xa0\\xa0 or if you put negative 1 over here you\\xa0\\nwould get 5x minus 3 is equal to 1 you\\xa0\\xa0 could add 3 to both sides and you get\\xa0\\n5x equals 4 again X is equal to 4/5 so\\xa0\\xa0 you have exactly one solution you\\xa0\\nwould have X is equal to 4/5 y is\\xa0\\xa0 equal to negative 1 let's do one more\\xa0\\nwhen trying to find the solution of the\\xa0\\xa0 following system of linear

Well, let's see if we can\\nset this up as an equation. So let's figure out what\\nour unknown is first. Well, our unknown is\\nhow old he is right now. I'm just arbitrarily using x. We always like to use x. But I could've really\\nset it to be anything. But let's say x is equal\\nto how old he is right now. How old-- not how hold. How old he is now. Now, what do we know about how\\nold he will be in 40 years? Well, he's going to be\\nhow old he is now plus 40. So let me write that down. So in 40 years Imran is\\ngoing to be x plus 40, plus this 40 right over here. But they give us another\\npiece of information. This by itself isn't\\nenough to figure out how old he is right now. But they tell us\\nin 40 years, Imran will be 11 times as\\nold as he is right now. So that's saying that this\\nquantity right over here, x plus 40, is going\\nto be 11 times x. In 40 years, he's\\ngoing to be 11 times as old as he is right now. So this is going to be times 11. You take x, multiply\\nit times 11, you're going to get how old\\nhe's going to be in 40 years. So let's write that\\ndown as an equation. You take x, multiply\\nit by 11, so 11 times as old as he is\\nright now is how old he is going to be in 40 years. And we have set up a nice\\nlittle, tidy linear equation now. So we just have to solve for x. So let's get all the x's\\non the left-hand side. We have more x's here than\\non the right-hand side. So we avoid negative numbers,\\nlet's stick all the x's here. So if I want to get rid of\\nthis x on the right hand side, I'd want to subtract an x. But obviously, I can't\\njust do it to the right. Otherwise, the equality\\nwon't be true anymore. I need to do it on\\nthe left as well. And so I am left with--\\nif I have 11 of something and I take away 1 of them, I'm\\nleft with 10 of that something. So I'm left with 10 times x is\\nequal to-- well, these x's, x minus x is just 0. That was the whole point. It's going to be equal to 40. And you could do this in\\nyour head at this point, but let's just\\nsolve it formally. So if we want a 1\\ncoefficient here, we'd want to divide\\nby 10, but we've got to do that to both sides. And so we are left with-- and\\nwe could have our drum roll now. We are left with x is\\nequal to 4 years old. x is equal to 4. So our answer to the question,\\nhow old is Imran right now? He is 4 years old. And let's verify this. If he's 4 years old\\nright now, in 40 years he's going to be 44 years old. And 44 years old is indeed 11\\ntimes older than 4 years old.

       "  \"Let's do some more of these\\nclassic age word problems. So we're told that William\\nis 4 times as old as Ben. 12 years ago, William was\\n7 times as old as Ben. How old is Ben now? Once again, it's\\na good idea to try to do this on your own first,\\nand then I'll work through it. What's the unknown here? Well, the unknown here\\nis how old is Ben now. So let's set a variable equal\\nto that, and we do x or y. But since Ben starts with\\na b, let's use b for Ben. So let's let b equal Ben's\\ncurrent age, Ben's age now. Let's see how all of\\nthis other information relates to Ben's current\\nage, and then maybe we can set up some equation\\nand then solve for things. I'll do it a little bit\\nmore structured in this one. You could have done many\\nof the problems we've been working on in this way. Let's think about Ben, and\\nthen let's think about William. I'll do William in blue here. So let's think about William. And then there's two points\\nin time we're talking about. We're talking about\\nnow, today, and we're going to talk\\nabout 12 years ago. Over here, let's call that now. This will be our now\\ncolumn, and then this will be our 12 years ago. Let's see what we\\ncan fill in here. What is Ben's age now? Well, we just defined\\nthat as the variable b. That's the unknown. That's what we\\nhave to figure out. So let's just stick that there. That's just going to be b. Well, what's Ben's\\nage 12 years ago? So maybe we want to\\nexpress it in terms of b. If he's b now, 12 years\\nago, he was just b minus 12. Fair enough. Now what is William's age today? Well, this first sentence\\ngave us the information. William is 4 times\\nas old as Ben. And we can assume that\\nthey're talking about today, is 4 times as old as Ben. So if Ben is b, William\\nis going to be 4b. And so how old was\\nWilliam 12 years ago? Well, if he's 4b right\\nnow, 12 years ago, he'll just be 12 less than that. So he's 4b now. 12 years ago, he\\nwas 4b minus 12. So that's kind of interesting. But we haven't quite yet made\\nuse of the second statement. This is William 12 years ago. 12 years ago, William was\\n7 times as old as Ben. So 12 years ago, this number\\nis going to be 7 times this number. Or another way to think\\nabout, take this number and multiply it by 7, and\\nyou're going to get this number. 12 years ago, Ben's age\\nis 1/7 of William's age, or William's age is\\n7 times Ben's age. So let's see if we can set\\nthat up as an equation. We can have-- let me\\nwrite this down-- 7 times Ben's age 12 years\\nago, b minus 12, is going to be equal\\nto William's age. And it seems like we've\\ndone the hard part. We've set up the equation. Now we just use a little\\nbit of our algebraic tools to solve for b. So let's do that. The first thing we\\nmight want to do, we could distribute\\nthe 7, so 7 times b, 7 times, essentially,\\na negative 12. We have 7b minus 7\\ntimes 12-- let's see. That's 84-- is going to\\nbe equal to 4b minus 12. This whole expression\\nis literally 7 times Ben's age 12 years ago. Now what can we\\ndo to solve this? Well, we can subtract 4b from\\nboth sides, so let's do that. I could do two steps\\nat the same time. Well, actually, let's\\njust keep it simple. I'm going to subtract\\n4b from both sides. That goes away. On the right-hand side,\\nI have a negative 12. On the left-hand side, I am\\nleft with 7b minus 4b is 3b. And then I still\\nhave a minus 84. Well, I want to get rid of\\nthis negative 84, this minus 84 on the left-hand side. So let's add 84 to both sides. On the left-hand side,\\nI'm just left with 3b. And on the right-hand side,\\nI have negative 12 plus 84, or 84 minus 12, which is 72. Now if I want to\\nsolve for b, I just have to divide both sides\\nof that equation by 3. And so I am left\\nwith b is equal to-- and now we have our\\ndrum roll-- 72/3. And you might be able\\nto do that in your head. It would be 24, I believe. You could work it out on\\npaper if you have trouble. Let's just do it real quick. 72, 3 goes into 7 two times. You get a 2 times 3 is 6,\\nsubtract, you bring down the 2, 3 goes into 12 four times. So b is equal to 24. Going back to our question,\\nwhat is Ben's age now? It is 24. And let's verify that\\nthis is actually the case. They're telling us that William\\nis 4 times as old as Ben. So what is William's\\ncurrent age? Well, 4 times 24 is 96,\\nso William is a senior. We should call him Mr. William. He is 96 years old. Maybe he's Ben's grandfather\\nor great-grandfather. Then they say 12 years ago,\\nWilliam-- well, 12 years ago, William was 84 years old. So he was 84 years old. They say that's 7\\ntimes as old as Ben. Well, 12 years ago, if\\nhe's 24 now, Ben was 12. And indeed, 84 is 7 times\\n12, so it all worked out. \"),\n",

And what I am curious\\nabout in this video is how many years will it\\ntake-- and let me write this down-- how many\\nyears will it take for Arman to be three\\ntimes as old as Diya? So that's the\\nquestion right there, and I encourage you to try to\\ntake a shot at this yourself. So let's think about\\nthis a little bit. We're asking how many\\nyears will it take. That's what we don't know. That's what we're curious about. How many years will\\nit take for Arman to be three times\\nas old as Diya? So let's set some variable--\\nlet's say, y for years. Let's say y is equal\\nto years it will take. So given that, can we\\nnow set up an equation, given this information,\\nto figure out how many years it will take\\nfor Arman to be three times as old as Diya? Well, let's think about how\\nold Arman will be in y years. How old will he be? Let me write here. In y years, Arman is\\ngoing to be how old? Arman is going to be--\\nwell, he's 18 right now-- and in y years, he's\\ngoing to be y years older. So in y years, Arman is\\ngoing to be 18 plus y. And what about Diya? How old will she be in y years? Well, she's 2 now,\\nand in y years, she will just be 2 plus y. So what we're curious about,\\nnow that we know this, is how many years will it\\ntake for this quantity, for this expression, to be\\nthree times this quantity? So we're really curious. We want to solve for\\ny such that 18 plus y is going to be equal\\nto 3 times 2 plus y. Notice, this is\\nArman in y years. This is Diya in y years. And we're saying that what\\nArman's going to be in y years is three times what Diya\\nis going to be in y years. So we've set up our equation. Now we can just solve it. So let's take this step by step. So the left hand\\nside-- and maybe I'll do this in a new\\ncolor, just so I don't have to keep switching--\\nso on the left hand side, I still have 18 plus y. And on the right hand side,\\nI can distribute this 3. So 3 times 2 is 6. 3 times y is 3y. 6 plus 3y. And then it's always nice\\nto get all of our constants on one side of the equation,\\nall of our variables on the other side\\nof the equation. So we have a 3y over here. We have more y's on the right\\nhand side than the left hand side. So let's get rid of the\\ny's on the left hand side. You could do it\\neither way, but you'd end up with negative numbers. So let's subtract\\na y from each side. And we are left with, on\\nthe left hand side, 18. And on the right hand side\\nyou have 6 plus 3 y's. Take away one of those y's. You're going to be\\nleft with 2 y's. Now we can get rid of\\nthe constant term here. So we will subtract\\n6 from both sides. 18 minus 6 is 12. The whole reason why we\\nsubtracted 6 from the right was to get rid of this, 6\\nminus 6 is 0, so you have 12 is equal to 2y. Two times the number of\\nyears it will take is 12, and you could probably\\nsolve this in your head. But if we just want a\\none-coefficient year, we would divide\\nby 2 on the right. Whatever we do to one\\nside of an equation, we have to do it\\non the other side. Otherwise, the equation will\\nnot still be an equation. So we're left with y is equal\\nto 6, or y is equal to 6. So going back to the\\nquestion, how many years will it take for Arman to be\\nthree times as old as Diya? Well, it's going\\nto take six years. Now, I want you to verify this. Think about it. Is this actually true? Well, in six years, how\\nold is Arman going to be? He's going to be 18 plus 6. We now know that\\nthis thing is 6. So in six years,\\nArman is going to be 18 plus 6, which\\nis 24 years old. How old is Diya going to be? Well, she's going to be 2\\nplus 6, which is 8 years old. And lo and behold, 24 is,\\nindeed, three times as old as 8. In 6 years-- Arman\\nis 24, Diya is 8-- Arman is three times as\\nold as Diya, and we are done. \"),\n",

He immediately got on his school bus and traveled at an average speed of 60 kilometers per hour\\nuntil he got to school. The total distance from his home to school is 35 kilometers, and the entire trip took one and a half hours. How many kilometers did Yochanan cover by walking, and how many kilometers did he cover by travelling\\non the bus? It's fascinating. So I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about on your own. Alright, so let's just\\ndefine some variables here. How many kilometers did\\nhe cover by walking? Let's call this W and how many kilometers did he cover by travelling on the bus? Let's call that, Let's call that B and so what do we know? We know that the kilometers and I can actually even\\ndraw it just to make sure that we're visualizing this thing, right? So this right over here is\\nhis home, that's his home and then he is going to\\ntravel and see they tell us, they tell us that it is\\n35 kilometers to school so this is his school right over here. I'll draw a bigger\\nbuilding, that's his school, and we know that this\\ndistance is 35, 35 kilometers and we also know that it\\ntook one and a half hours. One and a half hours, now he traveled at different rates for\\ndifferent distances. So he traveled some\\ndistance to the school bus so this is, or to the bus stop, so that's the bus stop, right over there, and we're seeing this\\ndistance to the bus stop, that's how much he covered by walking. So this right over here, this\\ndistance, right over here, that is W and the rest of the distance, he covered by the bus, so\\nthe rest of this distance, all of this distance right over there, that is going to be B. So what do we know? We know the distance covered by walking plus the distance covered by bus is going to be 35 kilometers,\\n35 kilometers here, this is the entire, that\\nis the entire distance from home to school, so\\nwe know that W plus B, W plus B, plus B is\\nequal to 35 kilometers, is equal to 35 kilometers\\nand just with one equation, we're not going to be able to\\nfigure out what W and B are but we have another constraint. We know the total amount of time. So the total amount of time is going to be one and half hours, so we'll\\njust write that over here. This is going to be 1.5, so\\nwhat's the time traveled by, what's the time he walks? Let me write this over here, time time walking, we'll that's going to be the distance walking\\ndivided by the rate walking. So the distance walking is W kilometers W kilometers divided by his rate, the distance divided by your rate is gonna give you your time, so let's see, his rate is five kilometers per hour, five kilometers per\\nhour and so you're gonna have kilometers cancel kilometers and if you divide by or\\nif you have one over hours in the denominator, that's\\ngoing to be the same thing, this is gonna be W over five\\nhours, so the units work out. So his time walking is W over five, W over five and by that same logic, his time on the bus is\\ngoing to be the distance on the bus divided by,\\ndivided by the average speed of the school bus, so\\nthis is going to be 60. This is all going to be in hours and now we can solve\\nthis system of equations. We have two linear\\nequations with two unknowns. We should be able to find W and B that satisfy both of these. Now what's an easy thing to do? Let's see, if I can multiply\\nthis second equation by negative five, and I'm gonna, this is going to be a negative W here so it'll cancel out with this W up there. So let's do that, let's\\nmultiply the second equation by, I'm just gonna\\nswitch to one color here, so this top equation is going\\nto be W plus B is equal to 35. This bottom equation,\\nif I multiply both sides by negative five, so both\\nsides by negative five, I'm going to multiply both\\nsides by negative five I'm going to get negative\\nfive times W over five is negative W, negative\\nfive times B over 60. Let's see, it's gonna be,\\nit's going to be negative five over 60, that's negative\\n1/12, so this is negative B over 12 and then it is\\ngoing to be equal to 1.5 times negative five is\\nnegative 7.5, negative 7.5. Now we can just add the left and right hand sides of these two equations. Now let me, I can do\\nthis a little bit neater, let me actually delete, let me make these line up a little bit better\\nso that we, delete that, make this, so this first\\nequation was, whoops, this first equation was\\nW plus B is equal to 35 now they line up better and now we can add the left hand sides of these equations and the right hand sides,\\nso the left hand sides, the W's cancel out. That's what we wanted. Now B minus B over 12 or\\nB minus the twelfth of B, well that's going to be 11/12B, 11/12B is equal to, let's see, 35 minus 7.5, see 35 minus seven would be 28 and then another\\nhalf this would be 27.5. 27.5 and since I'm dealing\\nwith a fraction here, let me write this as a fraction so this is the same thing as 55 over two. Let's me just write it this way. This is the same thing as 55 over two. Now to solve for B, I\\njust have to multiply both sides times this reciprocal. I'll switch colors just\\nto ease the monotony. So multiply both sides by\\n12 over 11, 12 over 11, what we get, these cancel out, what we get is that B, so I'll do this in this color, B is equal to, let's see, I\\nhave a 12 in the numerator two in the denominator so I can make that a six and a one,\\nthen I have a 55 and 11, I can divide both by 11, so\\nit's gonna be five and a one. So it's five times six, B is equal to 30 and B was in kilometers so\\nif he travels 30 kilometers, 30 kilometers by bus, B\\nis equal to 30 kilometers, and the amount that he walks,\\nwell, we can figure that out. If this is 30, well the amount that he walks is going to be five. This is going to be five kilometers, W, let me write this, W is\\nequal to five kilometers. He walks five kilometers and then he goes by the bus 30 kilometers. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] A factory has\\nmachines that produce toys, which are then packed by\\nthe factory's workers. One day, each machine produced 14 toys and each worker packed two toys, so that a total of 40\\ntoys remained unpacked. Additionally, the number of\\nworkers that day was eight less than seven times the number of machines. How many machines and workers were there? I encourage you to pause the video. This is a good little problem over here. All right, so let's define some variables. So let's say M is equal to the number of machines, and let's say that W is equal to the number of workers. Those seem like reasonable variables. So what does the first sentence tell us? It tells us one day each\\nmachine produced 14 toys. So if each machine produced 14 toys, what is the total number of toys that are going to be produced? Well, the total number\\nof toys that are going to be produced is going to\\nbe the number per machine times the number of machines. So this is 14M toys produced. So this is what is produced.\\nProduced, right over there. And then how many toys\\nare going to be packed? Well, if each worker packed two toys, they tell us there, each\\nworker packed two toys, so the total number that's\\ngoing to be packed is going to be two toys per worker\\ntimes the number of workers. So that right over there, that's\\nthe number of toys packed. And then they tell us the\\nnumber of toys that remain, the total that remains unpacked. So the total that remains\\nunpacked, we know that that is 40. Let me do that in a neutral color. So 40, for 40, so that we could view the 40\\nas produced, but not packed. Produced, not packed. That's the number, the\\ntotal the remain unpacked. Well, how do we relate produced and packed to the produced that are not packed? Well, if we take the\\ntotal that were produced, we subtract out the\\nnumber that were packed, we're gonna be left with\\nthe total that are unpacked. So just like that, we're able to set up a linear\\nrelationship between M and W. Well, just one isn't enough\\nto solve for M and W, but we have another relationship. They say, additionally, the\\nnumber of workers that day, so the number of workers that day. I could say W. I'll write it over here. W, the number of workers that day, was eight less than seven\\ntimes the number of machines. Or you could say it was equal\\nto seven times the number of machines minus eight. That would be eight less\\nthan seven times the number of machines. 7M minus eight. And now we have two\\nequations with two unknowns. If things work out well, we might be able to actually solve for W and M. So there is a bunch of ways to do it. Since this equation already\\nhas W explicitly solved for, we can do some substitution here. We can take this W and\\nsubstitute it in for this W. Or, actually I should say,\\nwe could take 7M minus eight and substitute it in for this W, since the M and W, the\\npair that we wanna find, need to satisfy both equations. And so we are going to get, we're going to get 14M minus, minus two, minus two times, let me do that in a, so minus two times, and instead of a W, I can write the 7M minus eight. So 7M minus eight, and we get that equals 40, is equal to 40, so we get, now it's just a little bit of algebra. 14M and then, let's see, I'll do everything in a neutral color now. So negative two times 7M is negative 14M, and then negative two times negative eight is plus 16, and then that's going to be equal to 40. Now, 14M minus 14M, that's\\njust going to be zero, and we're left that 16 is equal to 40. Well, that's never going to be true. 16 is never going to be equal to 40. Doesn't matter what M and W are. In fact, M and W have been\\neliminated from this equation. This is impossible. This right over here is impossible, for 16 to be equal to 40, and because of that, there\\nare no solutions to this. There's no M and W pair that matches the constraints they gave us, so there is no solution. No solution. I'll put that in a little square there. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Farmer Jan\\nis a vegetable farmer who divides his field\\nbetween broccoli crops and spinach crops. Last year, he grew six\\ntons of broccoli per acre, so six tons of broccoli per acre, and nine tons of spinach, nine tons of spinach per acre, for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. This year, he grew two\\ntons of broccoli per acre, so this year, he grew two\\ntons of broccoli per acre, and three tons of spinach per acre, and three tons of spinach per acre, for a total of 31 tons of vegetables. How many acres of broccoli\\ncrops and how many acres of spinach crops does Farmer Jan have? So let's think about this. So let's say that the number\\nof acres of broccoli crops, let's call that B, and let's say the acres of spinach crops, acres of spinach crops, let's call that S. So how much broccoli is he going to grow in, I guess you could say, last year? Last year, how much broccoli did he grow? And let me just write this\\ndown. This is last year. Last year. And they tell us, last\\nyear he grew six tons of broccoli per acre. So if he grew six tons\\nof broccoli per acre, and he has B acres, well, that means he grew six tons per acre times B acres. So he grew 6B tons of broccoli last year. And by the same logic,\\nhe grew how much spinach? Well, nine tons of spinach\\nper acre times S acres. So 9S tons of spinach, and then the total is 93 tons, so for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 93. So now let's think about this year. And in general, when you\\ntackle these, just think about, well, set the variables in general to what they're asking for, and then, how can you use the information\\nthat they're giving us? So this year, how much\\nbroccoli would he have grown? Well, he grew two tons\\nof broccoli per acre, so he grew two tons per acre. He has the same number of\\nacres. We can assume that. So two tons per acre times B acres is gonna be 2B tons of broccoli. And by that same logic, it's going to be, he grew three tons of spinach per acre. Well, he has S acres. Each of those acres,\\nhe's growing three tons of spinach per acre, so it's\\ngoing to be 3S tons of spinach. And they tell us what that total is. That total is, for a total\\nof 31 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 31. And so now we have a\\nsystem of two equations with two unknowns, that we\\ncan use to solve for B and S. So let's see. What do we\\nwanna solve for first? Well, what we could do, let\\nme rewrite the top equation. So we have 6B plus, plus 9S is equal to 93, is equal to 93. And the second equation, we'll let's try to eliminate the Bs. So let's multiply the second\\nequation by negative three. I'm gonna multiply the left\\nhand side by negative three, and I'm gonna multiply the right hand side by negative three. What am I going to get? Negative three times 2B is negative 6B. That was the whole point by multiplying it by negative three. Negative three times 3S is negative 9S, negative 9S. And then, negative three times 31 is going to be negative 93. So what do we get if we\\nnow add the two sides of these equations? So on the left hand side,\\n6B minus 6B, that's zero. 9S minus 9S, that's zero.\\nWe're gonna get just zero. On the right hand side we get 93 minus 93. Well, that's still just going to be zero. So we have this situation\\nwhere we get zero equals zero, which is going to be true\\nno matter what X and Y are, and so this is a system\\nwith an infinite number of solutions. So this has infinite, infinite number of solutions. So one way we could think about it is, these two constraints, they're not giving us enough information. There's an infinite number\\nof B and S combinations that would satisfy these equations, so they're not giving\\nus enough information to say exactly what B and S are. So there is not enough, not enough info! Put an exclamation mark there. \"),\n",

They tell us that the weight\\nof 3 televisions and 5 DVD players is 62.5 pounds, and the\\nweight of 3 televisions and 2 DVD players-- so they're\\ngiving us different combinations-- is 52 pounds. Create a system of\\nequations that represents this situation. Then solve it to find out how\\nmuch each television and DVD player weighs. Well, the two pieces of\\ninformation they gave us in each of these statements can be\\nconverted into an equation. The first one is is that the\\nweight of 3 televisions and 5 DVD players is 62.5 pounds. Then they told us that the\\nweight of 3 televisions and 2 DVD players is 52 pounds. So we can translate these\\ndirectly into equations. If we let t to be the weight of\\na television, and d to be the weight of a DVD player, this\\nfirst statement up here says that 3 times the weight\\nof a television, or 3 televisions, plus 5 times the\\nweight of a DVD player, is going to be equal\\nto 62.5 pounds. That's exactly what this first\\nstatement is telling us. The second statement, the weight\\nof 3 televisions and 2 DVD players, so if I have 3\\ntelevisions and 2 DVD players, so the weight of 3 televisions\\nplus the weight of 2 DVD players, they're telling us\\nthat that is 52 pounds. And so now we've set up the\\nsystem of equations. We've done the first part,\\nto create a system that represents the situation. Now we need to solve it. Now, one thing that's especially\\ntempting when you have two systems, and both of\\nthem have something where, you know, you have a 3t here and\\nyou have a 3t here, what we can do is we can multiply one of\\nthe systems by some factor, so that if we were to add this\\nequation to that equation, we would get one of the terms\\nto cancel out. And that's what we're going\\nto do right here. And you can do this, you can\\ndo this business of adding equations to each other, because\\nremember, when we learned this at the beginning of\\nalgebra, anything you do to one side of an equation, if\\nI add 5 to one side of an equation, I have to add 5 to\\nanother side of the equation. So if I add this business to\\nthis side of the equation, if I add this blue stuff to the\\nleft side of the equation, I can add this 52 to the\\nright-hand side, because this is saying that 52 is the same\\nthing as this thing over here. This thing is also 52. So if we're adding this to the\\nleft-hand side, we're actually adding 52 to it. We're just writing it\\na different way. Now, before we do that, what I\\nwant to do is multiply the second, blue equation\\nby negative 1. And I want to multiply\\nit by negative 1. So negative 3t plus-- I could\\nwrite negative 2d is equal to negative 52. So I haven't changed the\\ninformation in this equation. I just multiplied everything\\nby negative 1. The reason why I did that is\\nbecause now if I add these two equations, these 3t terms\\nare going to cancel out. So let's do that. Let's add these two equations. And remember, all we're doing is\\nwe're adding the same thing to both sides of this\\ntop equation. We're adding essentially\\nnegative 52 now, now that we've multiplied everything\\nby a negative 1. This negative 3t plus negative\\n2d is the same thing as negative 52. So let's add this left-hand\\nside over here. The 3t and the negative\\n3t will cancel out. That was the whole point. 5d plus negative 2d is 3d. So you have a 3d is equal to\\n62.5 plus negative 52, or 62.5 minus 52 is 10.5. And now we can divide both sides\\nof this equation by 3. And you get d is equal\\nto 10.5 divided by 3. So let's figure out\\nwhat that is. 3 goes into 10.5-- it goes\\ninto 10 three times. 3 times 3 is 9. Subtract. Get 1. Bring down the 5. Of course, you have your decimal\\npoint right here. 3 goes into 15 five times. 5 times 3 is 15. You've got to subtract,\\nand you get a 0. So it goes exactly 3.5 times. So the weight of a DVD player--\\nthat's what d represents-- is 3.5 pounds. Now we can substitute back into\\none of these equations up here to figure out the weight\\nof a television. We can just use that\\ntop equation. So you get 3t plus 5 times the\\nweight of a DVD player, which we just figured out is 3.5. Remember, we're just looking for\\nvalues that satisfy both of these equations. So 5 times 3.5-- needs\\nto be equal to 62.5. So you get 3t plus-- what\\nis this going to be? This is going to be 15\\nplus 2.5, right? 5 times 0.5 is 2.5,\\n5 times 3 is 15. So it's 17.5, is\\nequal to 62.5. Now we can subtract 17.5 from\\nboth sides of this equation. And what do we get? The left-hand side is\\njust going to be 3t. This cancels out, that was\\nthe whole point of it. 3t is going to be equal\\nto-- let's see. The 0.5 minus 0.5,\\nthat cancels out. So this is the same thing\\nas 62 minus 17. 62 minus 7 would be 55. And so we're going to\\nsubtract another 10. So it's going to be 45. So this is going to\\nbe equal to 45. Now you can divide both sides\\nof this equation by 3. And we get t is equal to 15. So we've solved our system. The weight of a DVD player is\\n3.5 pounds, and the weight of a television is 15 pounds. And we're done. \"),\n",

Can we solve for the price\\nof an apple and an orange using this information\\nin a system of linear equations\\nin two variables? If yes, what is the solution? If no, what is the\\nreason we cannot? So we're trying to figure\\nout the price of an apple and the price of an orange. So I would use a for apple, but\\nI don't like using o for orange because o looks too\\nmuch like a zero. So I'll just say x for apples. Let's let x equal\\nthe price of apples. And let's let y equal\\nthe price of oranges. So let's describe what\\nhappened to the person in line in front of us. They bought 5 apples. So how much did they\\nspend on apples? Well, they bought 5 apples\\ntimes x dollars per apple, so they spent 5x dollars\\non their 5 apples. And they bought 4 oranges. They bought 4 oranges\\ntimes y dollars per orange. So they spent 4y on oranges. So the total amount that\\nthey spent is 5x plus 4y. And they tell us\\nthat this is $10. This is equal to $10. Now, you get in line,\\nand you buy 5 apples. So you buy 5 apples, just\\nlike the guy in front of you. And you paid x\\ndollars per apple. So you're going to pay 5 apples\\ntimes the price per apple. This is the amount that\\nyou spend on apples. And then you buy 5 oranges. So you're going to pay 5 oranges\\ntimes the price per orange, which is y. So this is how much\\nyou spend on oranges. This is how much you spend on\\napples and oranges, the sum. And they tell us\\nthat this is $11. So can we solve\\nfor an x and a y? And it looks like we can. And a big giveaway\\nright over here is the ratio between the x's and\\nthe y's in these two equations are different. So we're getting some\\ninformation here. If the ratios were\\nexactly the same, if this was 5x plus\\n4y right over here, and we got a different number,\\nthen we would be in trouble. Because we bought\\nthe same combination, but we got a different price. But the good thing is is that\\nwe have a different combination here. So let's see if we\\ncan work it out. Now, the most obvious\\nthing that jumps out at me is that I have a 5x here, and\\nI have a 5x right over here. So if I could subtract\\nthis 5x from that 5x, then I would cancel\\nout all of the x terms. So what I'm going\\nto do is I'm going to multiply this bottom\\nequation by negative 1. So it becomes negative\\n5x plus negative 5y is equal to negative 11. And then I'm going\\nto essentially add both of these equations. And I could do that\\nbecause I'm doing the same thing to both sides. I already know that this\\nthing is equal to this thing. So I'm just adding those\\nthings to either side. So on the left hand\\nside, I have 5x minus 5x. Well, those cancel out. And then I have 4y minus 5y. Well, that's negative y. And that's going to be\\nequal to 10 minus 11, which is negative 1. And then if we multiply\\nboth sides of this times negative 1, or divide\\nboth sides by negative 1, we're going to get\\ny is equal to 1. So just like that, we\\nwere able to figure out the price of oranges. It's $1 per orange. So this is equal to 1. Now let's figure out\\nthe price of apples. So we can go back into\\neither 1 of these equations. I'll go back into this first 1. So 5 times-- so let's go to the\\nperson in line in front of us. They bought 5 apples\\nat x dollars per apple, plus 4 oranges at $1 per orange,\\nand they spent a total of $10. So this of course is just 4. Let's subtract 4\\nfrom both sides, and we get-- well, 4 times 1\\nminus 4, that just cancels out. We're just going to be left\\nwith 5x on the left hand side. And on the right hand\\nside, we have 10 minus 4, which is equal to 6. And we can just divide both\\nsides by 6 now in order to solve for x. Oh, sorry. We can divide both sides by\\n5 in order to solve for x. It's late in the day. Brain isn't working. Dividing by 6 wouldn't\\nhave done anything. We would have gotten 5/6x. We just want to get an x here. So dividing both sides by 5, we\\nget x is equal to 6/5 dollars. Or you could say that\\nx is equal to 6/5, which is the same\\nthing as 1 and 1/5, which is the same\\nthing as $1.20. So it's $1 per orange,\\nand $1.20 per apple.

So let\\'s define\\nsome variables here. Let\\'s let n equal the\\nnumber of nickels. Maybe I\\'ll write \"let\" here. Let\\'s let q be equal to\\nthe number of quarters. So how many total\\ncoins do we have? We\\'\\', it\\'s going to be\\nthe number of nickels plus the number of quarters. So we have the nickels\\nplus the quarters need to be equal to--\\nwell, it tells us we have 16 total coins. So if we add up the\\ntotal number of nickels plus the number of\\nquarters, we have 16 coins. So that\\'s one\\nequation right there. And then how much\\ntotal money do we have? Well, however many\\nnickels we have, we can multiply that\\ntimes 0.05, and that\\'ll tell us how much money\\nwe have in nickels. So 0.05 times the nickels\\nplus the amount of money we have in quarters. Well, that\\'ll just be $0.25\\nper quarter, or 0.25 of $1. So let me write 0.25 times\\nthe number of quarters. For example, if I had 4\\nquarters and no nickels, I\\'d have 4 times\\n$0.25 which is $1. And no money due to nickels. So it\\'s however may\\nnickels times $0.05 plus however many\\nquarters times $0.25. That\\'s the total\\namount of money I have. And her piggy bank\\ntells me that is $2.00. That is equal to $2.00. So we have two equations\\nwith two unknowns. We can solve for n and q. And let\\'s do it by substitution. So the easiest thing that\\nwe could do here, let\\'s solve for q over here. So if n plus q is\\nequal to 16, we could subtract n from both\\nsides of this equation. So if n plus q is equal\\nto 16, if we subtract n from both sides, we get\\nq is equal to 16 minus n. So all I did is I rewrote\\nthis first constraint right over there. So since this first\\nconstraint is telling us that q, the number\\nof quarters, must be 16 minus the\\nnumber of nickels, in the second constraint,\\nevery place that we see a q, every place\\nwe see quarters, we can replace it\\nwith 16 minus n. So let\\'s do that. So the second constraint when\\nwe make the substitution becomes 0.05n plus 0.25. Instead of q, I\\'m going\\nto write 16 minus n. That\\'s what the first constraint\\ntells us. q must be 16 minus n. That is going to\\nbe equal to $2.00. We\\'re solving this\\nsystem by substitution. Now let\\'s see if I\\ncan simplify this. So we have 0.05n plus-- let\\'s\\ndistribute the 0.25 times the 16 and the 0.25\\ntimes the negative n. 0.25 times 16, that\\'s the\\nsame thing as 1/4 times 16. That\\'s just going to be 4. And then 0.25 times\\nnegative n is minus 0.25n. And that is going to\\nbe equal to $2.00. Let me scroll down a little bit. I\\'ll scroll down a little bit. See we have 0.05n minus 0.25n. So if I have 0.05 minus 0.25,\\nlet me combine these terms. So if I have 0.05 of something,\\nand I\\'m going to subtract from that 0.25 of that something,\\nthat\\'ll give me negative 0.20 of that something. If I combine these two terms,\\nI get negative 0.20 or negative 0.2n. And then of course,\\nI have the plus 4. Plus 4 is equal to $2.00, or we\\ncould even just write 2 there. Now, we can isolate the\\nn on the left-hand side by subtracting 4\\nfrom both sides. So let\\'s subtract\\n4 from both sides. And we are left with, on the\\nleft-hand side, negative-- I could just write that is\\nnegative 0.20n is equal to 2 minus 4 is negative 2. And then we could divide\\nboth sides by negative 0.2. Or I could write negative\\n0.20, the same thing. We\\'re not going to go too deep\\ninto the significance in all that. We\\'re assuming that we\\nhave infinite precision on everything. So negative 2 divided\\nby negative 0.2, these guys cancel out,\\nand we are left with n is equal to-- the\\nnegatives cancel out. 2 divided by 0.2 is\\njust going to be 10. n is equal to 10. And then we know that q\\nis equal to 16 minus n from the first constraint. q is equal to 16 minus n, which\\nis 10, which is going to be 6. So Zoey put in 10 nickels. I want to do that in\\na different color. She put in 10 nickels and\\n6 quarters in the bank. And we can verify it. So clearly she has 16 coins. So that part makes sense. 10 nickels, 6 quarters,\\nthat\\'s 16 coins. That makes sense. And we could also verify that\\nit\\'s the right amount of money. 10 nickels are going to be\\n$0.50, 10 times $0.05 each. So it\\'s going to be $0.50. And then 6 quarters\\nis going to be $1.50. So it\\'s going to be $1.50. So the total amount of money she\\nhas is $0.50 plus $1.50 which is $2.00. So it all works out. '),\n",

Let's take this first\\nequation that described local and multiply it by two. So let's just\\nmultiply it by two. So we're going to\\nmultiply both sides, otherwise equality\\nwon't hold anymore. So we would get 2x plus 2y is\\nequal to 2 times 5.30 is 10 euro 60. Now, something very\\ninteresting is going on here. If the local had bought twice\\nas many cups of coffee and twice as many croissants, he\\nwould have paid 10.60. And that would have been\\nthe exact amount of coffee and croissants you\\ngot and you paid 14. So it looks pretty\\nclear that you got charged a different amount. You got the tourist rate for\\nthe cup of coffee and croissant, while he got the local rate. And we can verify that\\nthere's no x and y that's going to satisfy this. And even logically\\nit makes sense here. 2x plus 2y is 14. Here, 2x plus 2y is 10 euro 60. And we could even show\\nthat mathematically this doesn't make sense. So if we were to subtract this\\nbottom equation from this top, so essentially you could\\nimagine multiplying the entire bottom\\nequation times negative 1. So let's multiply the entire\\nbottom equation by negative 1 and then we add\\nthese two equations. Remember all we're\\ndoing is we're starting with say this\\nequation, and we're adding the same\\nthing to both sides. We're going to add\\nthis to this side. And we already know that\\nnegative 10.60 is the same thing as this, we're\\ngoing to add to that side. So on the left hand side,\\nthis cancels with this, this cancels with this,\\nwe're left with 0. And on the right hand side,\\n14 minus 10.60 will get you to 3.40. And there's no x and y that\\nyou can think of that can all of a sudden make 0 equal 3.40. So there is no solution. And the only\\nexplanation over here is that the local was\\ncharged a cheaper rate. \"),\n",

       "  \"Determine whether the\\nordered pairs 3 comma 5 and 1 comma negative 7 are solutions\\nto the inequality 5x minus 3y is greater than or equal to 25. So again, let me just try\\neach of these ordered pairs. We could try what happens\\nwhen x is equal to 3 and y is equal to 5\\nin this inequality and see if it satisfies it. And then we could try\\nit for 1 and negative 7. So let's do that first. Let's do it first for 3 and 5. So when x is 3, y is 5. Let's see if this\\nactually gets satisfied. So we get 5 times 3. Let me color code it. So this is 5-- I didn't want to\\ndo it in that color-- 5 times 3 minus 3 times 5. Let's see if this is\\ngreater than or equal to 25. So 5 times 3 is 15. And then from that, we're\\ngoing to subtract 15, and let's see if that is\\ngreater than or equal to 25. Put that question mark\\nthere because we don't know. And 15 minus 15, that is 0. So we get the expression 0 is\\ngreater than or equal to 25. This is not true. 0 is less than 25. So this is not true. This is not true. So this ordered pair is not\\na solution to the inequality. So this is not a solution. You put in x is\\n3, y is 5, you get 0 is greater than\\nor equal to 25, which is absolutely not true. Now let's try it with\\n1 and negative 7. So we have 5 times 1\\nminus 3 times negative 7 needs to be greater\\nthan or equal to 25. 5 times 1 is 5, and then\\nminus 3 times negative 7 is negative 21. So it becomes minus\\nnegative 21 is to be greater than\\nor equal to 25. This is the same thing as\\n5 plus 21-- subtracting a negative same thing as\\nadding the positive-- is greater than or equal to 25. And 5 plus 21 is 26 is indeed\\ngreater than or equal to 25. So this works out. So this is a solution. And just to see if\\nwe can visualize this a little bit better, I'm\\ngoing to graph this inequality. I'm not going to show you\\nexactly how I do it this time, but I'm going to show you\\nwhere these points lie relative to this solution. So we have 5-- let me\\ndo this is a new color. So we have 5x-- that's\\nnot a new color. Having trouble\\nswitching colors today. We have 5x minus 3y is\\ngreater than or equal to 25. Let me write this\\ninequality in kind of our slope-intercept form. So this would be the same thing. If we subtract 5x\\nfrom both sides, we get negative\\n3y is greater than or equal to negative 5x plus 25. I just subtracted\\n5x from both sides. So that gets eliminated, and you\\nhave a negative 5x over here. Now let's divide both\\nsides of this equation, or I should say this\\ninequality, by negative 3. And when you divide both\\nsides of an inequality by a negative number, multiply\\nor divide by a negative number, it swaps the inequality. So if you divide both\\nsides by negative 3, you get y is less than or\\nequal to negative 5 divided by negative 3 is 5 over 3x. And then 25 divided by\\nnegative 3 is minus 25/3. So this is now the\\nexpression or the inequality, y is less than or equal\\nto 5/3 x minus 25/3. So if I wanted to\\ngraph this-- I'll try to draw a relatively\\nrough graph here, but really just so that\\nwe can visualize this. So our y-intercept\\nis negative 25/3. That's the same thing\\nas negative 8 and 1/3. So that's 1, 2,\\n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and a little bit more than 8. So our y-intercept is\\nnegative 8 and 1/3 like that. And it has a slope of 5/3. So that means for every 3 it\\ngoes to the right, it rises 5. So it goes 1, 2, 3, it rises 5. So the line is going to\\nlook something like this. I'm drawing a very\\nrough version of it. So the line will look something\\nlike that, this line over here. That's if it was a y is\\nequal to 5/3 x minus 25/3. But here we have an inequality. It's y is less than or equal to. So for any x, the y's that\\nsatisfy it are the y's that equals 5/3 x minus 25/3--\\nthat would be on the line, so it would be\\nthat point there-- and all the y's less than it. So the solution is this\\nwhole area right over here. Since it's less than or equal\\nto, we can include the line. The equal to allows us\\nto include the line, and the less than tells us we're\\ngoing to go below the line. And we can verify\\nthat by looking at these two points over here. We saw that 3 comma 5 is\\nnot part of the solution. So 3 comma 5 is 1, 2--\\nit's right about there and then up 5. So 3 comma 5 is\\nright above here. It's in this region\\nabove the line, and notice not part\\nof the solution. And then 1 comma negative 7 is\\ngoing to be right over here. It's almost on the line. So 1 comma negative 7 is\\ngoing to be right over there. But it is, at least,\\nwithin this solution area. So hopefully that gives\\nyou a little bit more sense of how to visualize\\nthese things. And we'll cover this in more\\ndetail in future videos. \"),\n",

In order for two comma five to be a solution of this system, it just has to satisfy both inequalities. So, lets just try it out. So when X is equal to two and Y is equal to five, it has to satify both of these. So lets try it with the first one. So if we assume X is two and Y is five, we would get an inequality that says that five is greater than or equal to two times two plus one. X is two; Y is five. This gives us five is greater than or equal to two times two is four plus one is five. Y is greater than or equal to five. That's true! Five is equal to five. So that equal part of the greater than or equal saves us. That definitely satisfies the first inequality. Lets see the second one. X needs to be greater than one. So in two comma five, X is two.

On our xy coordinate plane, we\\nwant to show all the x and y points that satisfy this\\ncondition right here. So a good starting point might\\nbe to break up this less than or equal to, because we\\nknow how to graph y is equal to 4x plus 3. So this thing is the same thing\\nas y could be less than 4x plus 3, or y could be\\nequal to 4x plus 3. That's what less than\\nor equal means. It could be less\\nthan or equal. And the reason why I did that on\\nthis first example problem is because we know how\\nto graph that. So let's graph that. Try to draw a little bit\\nneater than that. So that is-- no, that's\\nnot good. So that is my vertical\\naxis, my y-axis. This is my x-axis,\\nright there. And then we know the\\ny-intercept, the y-intercept is 3. So the point 0, 3-- 1, 2,\\n3-- is on the line. And we know we have\\na slope of 4. Which means if we go 1 in the\\nx-direction, we're going to go up 4 in the y. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So it's going to\\nbe right here. And that's enough\\nto draw a line. We could even go back\\nin the x-direction. If we go 1 back in the\\nx-direction, we're going to go down 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. So that's also going to be\\na point on the line. So my best attempt at drawing\\nthis line is going to look something like-- this\\nis the hardest part. It's going to look something\\nlike that. That is a line. It should be straight. I think you get the idea. That right there is the graph\\nof y is equal to 4x plus 3. So let's think about what it\\nmeans to be less than. So all of these points\\nsatisfy this inequality, but we have more. This is just these\\npoints over here. What about all these where\\ny ix less than 4x plus 3? So let's think about\\nwhat this means. Let's pick up some\\nvalues for x. When x is equal to 0,\\nwhat does this say? When x is equal to 0, then that\\nmeans y is going to be less than 0 plus 3.\\ny is less than 3. When x is equal to negative 1,\\nwhat is this telling us? 4 times negative 1 is negative\\n4, plus 3 is negative 1. y would be less than negative 1. When x is equal to 1, what\\nis this telling us? 4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7. So y is going to\\nbe less than 7. So let's at least try\\nto plot these. So when x is equal to-- let's\\nplot this one first. When x is equal to 0, y is less than 3. So it's all of these points\\nhere-- that I'm shading in in green-- satisfy that\\nright there. If I were to look at this one\\nover here, when x is negative 1, y is less than negative 1. So y has to be all of these\\npoints down here. When x is equal to 1,\\ny is less than 7. So it's all of these\\npoints down here. And in general, you take any\\npoint x-- let's say you take this point x right there. If you evaluate 4x plus 3,\\nyou're going to get the point on the line. That is that x times 4 plus 3. Now the y's that satisfy it,\\nit could be equal to that point on the line, or it\\ncould be less than. So it's going to go\\nbelow the line. So if you were to do this for\\nall the possible x's, you would not only get all the\\npoints on this line which we've drawn, you would get all\\nthe points below the line. So now we have graphed\\nthis inequality. It's essentially this line, 4x\\nplus 3, with all of the area below it shaded. Now, if this was just a less\\nthan, not less than or equal sign, we would not include\\nthe actual line. And the convention to do that is\\nto actually make the line a dashed line. This is the situation if we were\\ndealing with just less than 4x plus 3. Because in that situation, this\\nwouldn't apply, and we would just have that. So the line itself wouldn't have\\nsatisfied it, just the area below it. Let's do one like that. So let's say we have y is\\ngreater than negative x over 2 minus 6. So a good way to start-- the\\nway I like to start these problems-- is to just graph\\nthis equation right here. So let me just graph-- just for\\nfun-- let me graph y is equal to-- this is the same\\nthing as negative 1/2 minus 6. So if we were to graph it, that\\nis my vertical axis, that is my horizontal axis. And our y-intercept\\nis negative 6. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that's my y-intercept. And my slope is negative 1/2. Oh, that should be an x there,\\nnegative 1/2 x minus 6. So my slope is negative 1/2,\\nwhich means when I go 2 to the right, I go down 1. So if I go 2 to the right,\\nI'm going to go down 1. If I go 2 to the left, if\\nI go negative 2, I'm going to go up 1. So negative 2, up 1. So my line is going\\nto look like this. My line is going to\\nlook like that. That's my best attempt\\nat drawing the line. So that's the line\\nof y is equal to negative 1/2 x minus 6. Now, our inequality is not\\ngreater than or equal, it's just greater than negative x\\nover 2 minus 6, or greater than negative 1/2 x minus 6. So using the same logic as\\nbefore, for any x-- so if you take any x, let's say that's\\nour particular x we want to pick-- if you evaluate negative\\nx over 2 minus 6, you're going to get that\\npoint right there. You're going to get the\\npoint on the line. But the y's that satisfy this\\ninequality are the y's greater than that. So it's going to be not that\\npoint-- in fact, you draw an open circle there-- because you\\ncan't include the point of negative 1/2 x minus 6. But it's going to be all the\\ny's greater than that. That'd be true for any x. You take this x. You evaluate negative 1/2 or\\nnegative x over 2 minus 6, you're going to get this\\npoint over here. The y's that satisfy it are\\nall the y's above that. So all of the y's that satisfy\\nthis equation, or all of the coordinates that satisfy this\\nequation, is this entire area above the line. And we're not going to\\ninclude the line. So the convention is to make\\nthis line into a dashed line. And let me draw-- I'm trying\\nmy best to turn it into a dashed line. I'll just erase sections of\\nthe line, and hopefully it will look dashed to you. So I'm turning that solid line\\ninto a dashed line to show that it's just a boundary, but\\nit's not included in the coordinates that satisfy\\nour inequality. The coordinates that satisfy our\\nequality are all of this yellow stuff that I'm shading\\nabove the line. Anyway, hopefully you\\nfound that helpful. \"),\n",

And then it has a\\nslope of negative 1. We could write this as y is\\nequal to negative 1x plus 5. That's a little bit\\nmore traditional. So once again, y-intercept at 5. And it has a slope\\nof negative 1. Or another way to think\\nabout it, when y is 0, x will be equal to 5. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So every time we move\\nto the right one, we go down one because we\\nhave a negative 1 slope. So it will look like this. And once again, I want\\nto do a dotted line because we are-- so\\nthat is our dotted line. And I'm doing a\\ndotted line because it says y is less than 5 minus x. If it was y is\\nequal to 5 minus x, I would have included the line. If it was y is less than\\nor equal to 5 minus x, I also would have\\nmade this line solid.

If x is 0, y is 1, and\\nthe slope is 2. If we move forward in the\\nx-direction 1, we move up 2. If we move forward 2, we'll\\nmove up 4, just like that. So this graph is going to look\\nsomething like this. Let me graph a couple more\\npoints here just so that I make sure that I'm drawing\\nit reasonably accurately. So it would look something\\nlike this. That's the graph of y is\\nequal to 2x plus 1. Now, for y is greater than or\\nequal, or if it's equal or greater than, so we have to put\\nall the region above this. For any x, 2x plus 1 will be\\nright on the line, but all the y's greater than that\\nare also valid. So the solution set of that\\nfirst equation is all of this area up here, all of the area\\nabove the line, including the line, because it's greater\\nthan or equal to. So that's the first inequality\\nright there. Now let's do the second\\ninequality. The second inequality is y\\nis less than 2x minus 5. So if we were to graph 2x minus\\n5, and something already might jump out at you\\nthat these two are parallel to each other. They have the same slope. So 2x minus 5, the y-intercept\\nis negative 5. x is 0, y is negative 1, negative 2, negative\\n3, negative 4, negative 5. Slope is 2 again. And this is only less than,\\nstrictly less than, so we're not going to actually\\ninclude the line. The slope is 2, so it will\\nlook something like that. It has the exact same slope\\nas this other line. So I could draw a bit of a\\ndotted line here if you like, and we're not going to include\\nthe dotted line because we're strictly less than. So the solution set for this\\nsecond inequality is going to be all of the area\\nbelow the line. For any x, this is 2x minus 5,\\nand we care about the y's that are less than that. So let me shade that in. So before we even get to this\\nlast inequality, in order for there to be something that\\nsatisfies both of these inequalities, it has to be in\\nboth of their solution sets. But as you can see, their\\nsolutions sets are completely non-overlapping. There's no point on the x, y\\nplane that is in both of these solution sets. They're separated by this kind\\nof no-man's land between these two parallel lines. So there is actually\\nno solution set. It's actually the null set. There's the empty set. Maybe we could put an empty set\\nlike that, two brackets with nothing in it. There's no solution set\\nor the solution set of the system is empty. We could do the x is\\ngreater than 1. This is x is equal to 1, so\\nwe put a dotted line there because we don't want\\ninclude that. So it would be all\\nof this stuff. But once again, there's nothing\\nthat satisfies all three of these. This area right here satisfies\\nthe bottom two. This area up here satisfies\\nthe last one and the first one. But there's nothing that\\nsatisfies both these top two. Empty set. \"),\n",

Ezra has a total of 11 liters\\nof water for these plants. In the following inequality, S represents the number\\nof sunflower plants and L represents the number of lily plants Ezra can water. See if this makes sense. So it looks like... So the number of sunflower plants is S and he would have to use\\n7/10 of a liter per plant. So this first term right over here, this is how much water used to water the sunflower plants and then the second term is how much water used to water the lily plants cause he needs half a liter\\nfor each of the L lily plants. And he has a total of 11 liters. So the sum right over here has to be less than or equal to 11. Alright. Ezra waters 10 lily plants. So that's L is equal to 10. How many sunflower plants\\ncan he water at most with the remaining amount of water? Well let's think about this a little bit. We have 0.7, 0.7 times the number of\\nsunflower plants he waters. Plus, plus... So we're gonna assume L is equal to 10. He waters 10 lily plants and each of them, he\\ngives half a liter to. So 0.5, 0.5 x 10 is going to be 5. So it's gonna be five liters,\\nwatering the 10 lily plants and this has to be less\\nthan or equal to 11. So we can try to isolate\\nthe S on the left hand side. So let's, let's do that.\\nThe number of sunflowers. So we could first subtract\\nfive from both sides. Subtract five from both sides. and we are going to be left with... We are going to be left\\nwith on the left hand side, we're gonna just have 0.7 x S So this expression is\\nthe total amount of water he's gonna spend on the sunflower plants has to be less than or equal to 11- 5 is equal to six. And so now, we can\\ndivide both sides by 0.7 And we're gonna have to\\nchange the inequality because we are diving by\\na positive number, 0.7 So we're gonna get S... S is less than or equal to 6 ÷ 0.7 or we could even write this as... we could write this as, well... This is 6 divided by 0.7 Let me write everything as a fraction. This is the same thing as 6 ÷ 7/10 which is equal to six times 10 over seven which is equal to 60/7 which is equal to what is this? 8 4/7 so S has to be less than\\neight and four sevenths. Now assuming that he's only, we're only thinking in\\nterms of whole plants... (mumbles) integer numbers but actually\\nwhole numbers of plants and so, if S has to be less than 8 4/7, how many sunflower plants can he water at most with the\\nremaining amount of water? Well, we'll say that he had, most he can water eight plants. We're gonna assume that he can't water just a fraction of a plant. He either waters something or he doesn't. So he's gonna water eight, he is gonna water eight plants. Cause that's the largest whole number that is less than 8 4/7. That satisfies...

The exact same number of\\ncomments for each cat video and the exact same number\\nfor each dog video.

So he wants to get over 9000 comments and we see that right over here. He wants to get over 9000 comments. So this we could view as a number of comments that he actually gets. Since we have some number times C, we can assume that, well C, well we know that C is\\na number of cat videos and so the number times C, that\\'s the number of comments that he gets from cat videos. And on a per cat video bases, he\\'s going to get 750 comments. Because if I say, \"Hey, look. \"I have C cat videos and on each of them, \"I have exactly 750 comments.\" Well, I\\'m gonna have 750 times C comments on all of my cat videos combined.

Well, if the total from\\ndog videos is 450 D, then we see he\\'s getting\\n450 comments per dog video. 450 comments per video times\\nthe number of dog videos gets the total comments from dog videos. So he gets 450 comments per dog video. \"Can Goku achieve this goal\\nby uploading eight cat videos \"and seven dog videos?\" So let\\'s think about this. Eight cat videos, seven dog videos.

Well, we just have to evaluate this. What is this going to be? Let\\'s see. 700 times eight is 5600. It\\'s going to be 5600 plus another 50 times eight is 400. So 5600 plus 400 is 60 hundred or 6000. So this is 6000 right over here. So that would be, if he\\nhas eight cat videos, he gets 750 comments per video so he\\'s going to have a\\ntotal of 6000 comments on all of the eight cat videos combined. And then 450 times seven, let\\'s see, 400 times seven is 2800 plus another 30, plus another 350, that\\'s going to be, what? 3150, is that right? Let\\'s see, that would be, let me show you to this right, 2800 plus 400 times seven is 2800. 50 times seven is 350. Yep, I think that is right. It all, all works out, 3150.

He wants to buy at least 15\\nitems with this card. Set up a system of inequalities\\nthat represents this scenario and identify the\\nrange of possible purchases using a graph. And that's why we have some\\ngraph paper over here. So let's define some\\nvariables. Let's let s equal the number\\nof songs he buys. And then let's let g equal the\\nnumber of games that he buys. Now if we look at this\\nconstraint right here, he wants to buy at least 15\\nitems with this card. So the total number of items are\\ngoing to be the number of songs plus the number\\nof games. And that has to be\\nat least 15. So it has to be greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So that's what that constraint\\ntells us right there. And then the other constraint is\\nthe gift card is worth $25. So the amount that he spends on\\nsongs plus the amount that he spends on games has to be\\nless than or equal to 25. So the amount that he spends on\\nsongs are going to be the number of songs he buys times\\nthe cost per song. Times $0.89 times-- so I will\\nsay 0.89-- times s. That's how much he spends on\\nsongs plus the cost per game, which is $1.99 times the\\nnumber of games. This is going to be the total\\namount that he spends. And that has to be less\\nthan or equal to 25. Now if we want to graph these,\\nwe first have to define the axes, so let me do\\nthat right here. And we only care about the first\\nquadrant because we only care about positive values for\\nthe number of songs and the number of games. We don't talk about scenarios\\nwhere he buys a negative number of songs or games. So just the positive quadrant\\nright here. Let me draw the axes. So let's make the vertical axis\\nthat I'm drawing right here, let's make that the\\nvertical axis and let's call that the song axis. So that's the number\\nof songs he buys. Let me make sure you\\ncan see that. That is the song axis. And then let's make this, this\\nhorizontal, that's going to be the number of games he buys. Let's bold it in. And just to make sure that we\\ncan fit on this page-- because I have a feeling we're going\\nto get to reasonably large numbers-- let's make each of\\nthese boxes equal to 2. So this would be 4, 8, 12, 16,\\n20, so on and so forth. And this would be 4-- this\\nobviously would be 0-- 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and so on. So let's see if we can graph\\nthese two constraints. Well, this first constraint, s\\nplus g is going to be greater than or equal to 15. The easiest way to think about\\nthis-- or the easiest way to graph this is to really think\\nabout the intercepts. If g is 0, what is s? Well, s plus 0 has to be greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So if g is 0, s is going to be\\ngreater than or equal to 15. Let me put it this way. So if I'm going to graph\\nthis one right here. If g is 0, s is greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So g is 0, s, 15, let's see,\\nthis is 12, 14, 15 is right over there. And s is going to be all of the\\nvalues equivalent to that or greater than for\\ng equal to 0. If s is equal to 0, g is greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So if s is equal to 0, g is\\ngreater than or equal to 15. So g is greater than\\nor equal to 15. So the boundary line, s plus g\\nis equal to 15, we would just have to connect these\\ntwo dots. Let me try my best to\\nconnect these dots. So it would look something\\nlike this. This is always the\\nhardest part. Let me see how well I can\\nconnect these two dots. Nope. Let me see. I should get a line\\ntool for this. So that's pretty good. So that's the line s plus\\ng is equal to 15. And we talk about the values\\ngreater than 15, we're going to go above the line. And you saw that when g is equal\\nto 0, s is greater than or equal to 15. It's all of these\\nvalues up here. And when s was 0, g was greater\\nthan or equal to 15. So this constraint right\\nhere is all of this. All of this area\\nsatisfies this. All of this area-- if you pick\\nany coordinate here, it represents-- and really you\\nshould think about the integer coordinates, because we're not\\ngoing to buy parts of games. But if you think about all of\\nthe integer coordinates here, they represent combinations of\\ns and g, where you're buying at least 15 games. For example here, you're buying\\n8 games and 16 songs. That's 24. So you're definitely meeting\\nthe first constraint. Now the second constraint. 0.89s plus 1.99g is less\\nthan or equal to 25. This is a starting point. Let's just draw the line 0.89s\\nplus 1.99 is equal to 25. And then we could think about\\nwhat region the less than would represent. Oh, 1.99g. And the easiest way to do this,\\nonce again, we could do slope y-intercept all\\nthat type of thing. But the easiest way is to\\njust find the s- and the g-intercepts. So if s is equal to 0 then we\\nhave 1.99g is equal to 25 or g is equal to-- let's get a\\ncalculator out for this. So if we take 25 divided\\nby 1.99, it is 12.56. g is equal to 12.56. So when s is 0, let\\nme plot this. When s is 0, g is 12.56. This is 12, this is 14. 12.56 is going to be right\\nthere, a little bit more than 12. That's that value there. And then let's do the same\\nthing if g is 0. So if g is equal to 0, then we\\nhave-- so this term goes away-- we have 0.89s. If we use just the equality\\nhere, the equation-- is equal to 25 or s is equal to-- get\\nthe calculator out again. So if we take 25 divided\\nby 0.89, we get-- it's equal to 28.08. Just a little over 28. So 28.08. So that is, g is 0, s is 28. So that is 2, 4, 24, 6, 8. A little over 28. So it's right over there. So this line, 0.89s plus 1.99g\\nis equal to 25 is going to go from this coordinate,\\nwhich is 0, 28. So that point right there. All the way down to\\nthe point 12.56,0. So let me see if I\\ncan draw that. It's going to go-- I'll draw\\nup one more attempt. Maybe if I start from the\\nbottom it'll be easier. That was a better attempt. Let me bold that in a little\\nbit, so you can make sure you can see it. So that line represents\\nthis right over here. Now if we're talking about the\\nless than area, what would that imply? So if we think about it, when\\ng is equal to 0, 0.89s is less than 25. So when g is equal to 0, if we\\nreally wanted the less than there, we could think\\nof it this way. It's less than instead of just\\ndoing less than or equal to. So s is less than 28.08. So it'll be the region below. When s is 0, g-- so if we think\\ns is 0, if we use this original equation, 1.99g will\\nbe less than or equal to. I use this just to plot the\\ngraph, but if we actually care about the actual inequality, we\\nget 1.99g is less than 25. g would be less than\\nor equal to 12.56. So when s is equal to 0,\\ng is less than 12.56. So the area that satisfies\\nthis second constraint is everything below this graph. Now we want the region that\\nsatisfies both constraints. So it's going to be the overlap\\nof the regions that satisfy one of the two. So the overlap is going to be\\nthis region right here. Below the orange graph and\\nabove the blue graph, including both of them. So if you pick any combination--\\nso if he buys 4 games and 14 songs,\\nthat would work. Or if he bought 2 games and\\n16 songs, that would work. So you can kind of\\nget the idea. Anything in that region-- and\\nhe can only buy integer values-- would satisfy \"),\n",

So the amount of sugar\\nthat she\\'s going to use for all of the cupcakes is going to be 35 grams per cupcake, let me write that a little bit neater, 35 grams per cupcake times\\nthe number of cupcakes.

These are all of the scenarios where she\\'s chopping\\nat least 20 vegetables, all this blue area\\nincluding the blue line. And it says, \"Inequality\\nB represents the range of all combinations she can\\nchop with her time limit.\" So, Inequality B, this is\\nall of the combinations where she is within her time limit, where she is not spending\\nany more than 540 seconds. \"What is the least number of carrots Ksenia can chop while achieving her goal?\" Well, her goal, remember she wants to chop at least 20 vegetables. So, you want to be in the blue area. You want to be in the solution set for Inequality A, which\\nwould be the blue area or on the blue line. And she wants to achieve her goal of meeting the time limit. So, she needs to also\\nbe in the solution set for Inequality B so she also has to be in the green area or on the green line. And so the overlap of the two, if she\\'s meeting both constraints, it\\'s going to be all of this area. This is the overlap of the two solution sets. So, in this overlap where is\\nthe least number of carrots. \"What is the least\\nnumber of carrots Ksenia can chop while achieving her goal.\" So, if we see here, the\\nleast number of carrots, you might tempted to\\nsay, \"Okay, 20 carrots, that is in the solution set.\" That would be 20 carrots\\nand zero broccoli heads but you can actually find a combination that has even fewer carrots. You can go all the way to this point because remember the points on the lines are also included in the solution sets, because they are solid\\nlines not dash lines. So, this point right over here, 10 carrots and 10 broccoli heads actually meets her goal. So, let me write that down. 10 carrots and 10 broccoli, 10 broccoli heads. Let me just write that, 10 broccoli heads. So, that\\'s the least amount. If you wanted to somehow figure out less than 10 carrots, in\\nany of those scenarios there\\'s no overlap. You know, if you say,\\n\"Oh, is there any way \"to do nine carrots?\" If you look over here there\\'s no overlap at c equals nine between\\nthe two solution sets. So, the minimum right over here is actually the point of intersection of these two lines. 10 carrots, 10 broccoli heads that\\'s the combination\\nthat has her chopping the minimum number of carrots while achieving, frankly, her goals, both of her goals.

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Diana the dog receives five dog biscuits for fetching each frisbee, and three dog biscuits\\nfor fetching each ball. Sounds like a pretty good deal. She plans to receive at most D dog biscuits before chasing her tail. Well, that's sounds reasonable. The inequality graph\\nbelow represents the set of all combinations where\\nDiana fetches F frisbees and fetches B balls in order to receive at most, at most, D dog biscuits 'cause at that point she\\nreasonably starts chasing her tail. According to the graph, we're gonna take a look at the graph in a second, according to the graph, what\\nis the most number of dog biscuits Diana wants to receive\\nbefore chasing her tail? In other words, what is D? So let's look at, let's\\ninterpret this graph properly. So if we look at the horizontal\\naxis right over here, that's F, that's the number of frisbees, the number of frisbees\\nshe catches, frisbees and this vertical axis,\\nthis is the number of balls, number of, number of balls that she gets and we know what the total number of biscuits are going to be. The total from catching frisbees,\\nif she catches F frisbees, she gets five biscuits per frisbee so the total from catching frisbees is 5F and if she catches, if she catches B balls or retrieves B balls so\\nif she gets those B balls, if she gets, what was it? Three? Three biscuits per ball? Yep! Three dog biscuits for fetching each ball, the total number of dog biscuits she gets for catching B balls is\\n3B and so the total number of biscuits she fetches is 5F plus 3B. This is the number of\\nbiscuits from frisbees. This is the number of biscuits from balls. Now we can see all of the\\nallowable combinations of number of frisbees\\nand number of balls here. And so for example, if she catches that point right over there, eight or retrieves eight balls and catches, well, that would be half of a frisbee, so that doesn't, that\\ndoesn't seem to make sense but if she retrieves eight\\nballs and catches one frisbee well, then, that's still\\nok, she still hasn't met her maximum number of biscuits yet. So how do we think about the\\nmaximum number of biscuits? Well, the maximum number of biscuits are any of these points when she, that are sitting on this line\\nand notice, the solutions that where all the points\\nit satisfies this inequality are all below this line\\nso she's hitting a maximum when she's on the line and an easy one might be this point right\\nover here where we see that, where we see that frisbees,\\nzero frisbees and 10 and 10 balls pretty much\\nmaximizes her number of biscuits. So if she catches 10 balls,\\nso let me write this down, so if B is equal to 10, B is equal to 10, F is zero, if F is equal to zero and B is equal to 10, well,\\nhow many is she going to catch? Or how many biscuits is she going to get? Well, she's going to get,\\nthis is gonna be zero and then three times 10 is 30, so that's gonna be 30\\nbiscuits, 30 biscuits. So this point right over\\nhere, this corresponds with 30 biscuits, 30 biscuits and you can see that any of these points along this blue line, actually\\ncorrespond to 30 biscuits. If you go over here, where F is six, let me write it here, F is equal to six and B is equal to zero so\\nspends all of her time, she's earns her biscuits purely through frisbee catching,\\nso this is a situation where F is equal to six\\nand B is equal to zero, you still have the same scenario, you still have, if F is\\nsix, five times six is 30 plus three times zero,\\nwe'll that's just gonna be once again, 30 biscuits, 30 biscuits. So her maximum, or the number of biscuits she needs before starts\\nchasing her tail is 30. So D is going to be 30 and\\nin fact, we can express this inequality as a 5F plus 3B has to be less than or equal to 30. Alright, then they ask\\nus another question. Can Diana fulfill her plan by fetching, can Diana fulfill her plan by fetching four frisbees and two balls? So let's see, four frisbees and two balls, this is right over here,\\nfour frisbees and two balls. So it's not, we're not saying that she has to maximize, that she\\nhas to get the 30 biscuits, she just cannot eat any\\nmore than 30 biscuits. So it seems like she can\\nfulfill her plan, let me see. The inequality graphed below\\nrepresents all the combinations where Diana fetches F frisbees and B balls in order to receive at\\nmost D dog biscuits. So let's see, is she fulfilling\\nher plan by fetching, well, yeah, I would say, yes. \"),\n",

And based on what that input is,\\nit will produce a given output. What is an example\\nof a function? I could have something\\nlike f of x-- and x tends to be the variable\\nmost used for an input into the function. And the name of a\\nfunction, f tends to be the most-used variable. But we'll see that you can\\nuse others-- is equal to, let's say, x squared,\\nif x is even. And let's say it is equal\\nto x plus 5, if x is odd. What would happen if we\\ninput 2 into this function? The way that we would\\ndenote inputting 2 is that we would want\\nto evaluate f of 2. This is saying, let's input\\n2 into our function f. And everywhere we\\nsee this x here, this variable-- you can kind\\nof use as a placeholder-- let's replace it with our input. So let's see. If 2 is even, do 2 squared. If 2 is odd, do 2 plus 5. Well, 2 is even, so we're\\ngoing to do 2 squared. In this case, f of 2 is\\ngoing to be 2 squared, or 4. Now what would f of 3 be? Well, once again, everywhere\\nwe see this variable, we'll replace it with our input. So f of 3, 3 squared if 3 is\\neven, 3 plus 5 if 3 is odd. Well, 3 is odd, so it's\\ngoing to be 3 plus 5. It is going to be equal to 8. You might say, OK,\\nthat's neat, Sal. This was kind of\\nan interesting way to define a function, a way to\\nkind of munch on these numbers. But I could have done this\\nwith traditional equations in some way, especially\\nif you allowed me to use the squirrelly\\nbracket thing. What can a function do that\\nmaybe my traditional toolkits might have not been\\nas expressive about? Well, you could even do\\na function like this. Let me not use f\\nand x anymore, just to show you that the notation\\nis more general than that. I could say h of a is equal to\\nthe next largest number that starts with the same\\nletter as variable a. And we're going to assume\\nthat we're dealing in English. Given that, what is\\nh of 2 going to be? Well, 2 starts with a T.\\nWhat's the next largest number that starts with a T? Well, it's going\\nto be equal to 3. Now what would h of-- I don't\\nknow, let's think about this, h of 8 be equal to? Well, 8 starts with an E.\\nThe next largest number that starts with an E-- it's\\nnot 9, 10-- it would be 11. And so now you see it's a\\nvery, very, very general tool. This h function that we just\\ndefined, we'll look at it. We'll look at the\\nletter that the number starts with in English. So it's doing this really,\\nreally, really, really wacky thing. Now not all functions\\nhave to be this wacky. In fact, you have already\\nbeen dealing with functions. You have seen things like\\ny is equal to x plus 1. This can be viewed\\nas a function. We could write this\\nas y is a function of x, which is\\nequal to x plus 1. If you give as an\\ninput-- let me write it this way-- for example,\\nwhen x is 0 we could say f of 0 is equal to, well, you take 0. You add 1. It's equal to 1. f of 2 is equal to 2. You've already done this before. You've done things\\nwhere you said, look, let me make a table of\\nx and put our y's there. When x is 0, y is 1. I'm sorry. I made a little mistake. Where f of 2 is equal to 3. And you've done this before\\nwith tables where you say, look, x and y. When x is 0, y is 1. When x is 2, y is 3. You might say, well, what\\nwas the whole point of using the function\\nnotation here to say f of x is equal to x plus 1? The whole point is to think\\nin these more general terms. For something like\\nthis, you didn't really have to introduce\\nfunction notations. But it doesn't hurt to introduce\\nfunction notations because it makes it very clear that\\nthe function takes an input, takes my x-- in this\\ndefinition it munches on it. It says, OK, x plus 1. And then it produces\\n1 more than it. So here, whatever the input\\nis, the output is 1 more than that original function. Now I know what you're asking. All right. Well, what is not\\na function then? Well, remember,\\nwe said a function is something that takes an\\ninput and produces only one possible output for\\nthat given input. For example-- and let\\nme look at a visual way of thinking about a function\\nthis time, or a relationship, I should say-- let's\\nsay that's our y-axis, and this right over\\nhere is our x-axis. Let me draw a circle\\nhere that has radius 2. So it's a circle of radius 2. This is negative 2. This is positive 2. This is negative 2. So my circle, it's\\ncentered at the origin. It has radius 2. That's my best attempt\\nat drawing the circle. Let me fill it in. So this is a circle. The equation of\\nthis circle is going to be x squared plus y squared\\nis equal to the radius squared, is equal to 2 squared,\\nor it's equal to 4. The question is, is this\\nrelationship between x and y-- here I've expressed\\nit as an equation. Here I've visually drawn all\\nof the x's and y's that satisfy this equation-- is this\\nrelationship between x and y a function? And we can see\\nvisually that it's not going to be a function. You pick a given x. Let's say x is equal to 1. There's two possible y's\\nthat are associated with it, this y up here and\\nthis y down here. We could even solve for that\\nby looking at the equation. When x is equal to 1, we\\nget 1 squared plus y squared is equal to 4. 1 plus y squared is equal to 4. Or subtracting 1 from both\\nsides, y squared is equal to 3. Or y is equal to the positive or\\nthe negative square root of 3. This right over here is the\\npositive square root of 3, and this right over here is\\nthe negative square root of 3. So this situation,\\nthis relationship where I inputted a 1\\ninto my little box here, and associated with\\nthe 1, I associate both a positive square root of\\n3 and a negative square root of 3, this is not a function. I cannot associate with my\\ninput two different outputs. I can only have one\\noutput for a given input. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] What we have\\nhere is a visual depiction of a function. And this is a depiction\\nof Y is equal to H of X. Now when a lot of people see\\nfunction notation like this they see it as somewhat\\nintimidating until you realize what it's saying. All a function is, is\\nsomething that takes an input, in this case it's taking X as\\nan input and then the function does something to it and then\\nit spits out some other value which is going to be equal to Y. So for example what is H\\nof four based on this graph that you see right over here? Pause this video and think through that. Well all H of four means\\nis when I input four into my function H what\\nY am I spitting out? Or another way to think about\\nit, when X is equal to four, what is Y equal to? Well when X is equal to four,\\nmy function spits out that Y is equal to three. We know that from this\\npoint right over here, so Y is equal to three, so H\\nof four is equal to three. Let's do another example. What is H of zero? Pause the video try to work that through. Well all this is saying is\\nif I input an X equals zero into the function what is going\\nto be the corresponding Y? Well when X equals zero we\\nsee that Y is equal to four. So it's as simple as that. Given the input what is\\ngoing to be the output? And that's what these points\\nrepresent, each of these points represent a different\\noutput for a given input. Now it's always good to keep\\nin mind one of the things that makes it a function is\\nthat for given X that you input you only get one Y. For example if we had two dots\\nhere, then all of a sudden or we have two dots for X\\nequals six, now all of a sudden we have a problem\\nfiguring out what H of six would be equal to because\\nit could be equal to one or it could be equal to three. So if we had this extra dot\\nhere, then this would no longer be a function. In order for it to be a\\nfunction for any given X, it has to output a unique\\nvalue, it can't output two possible values. Now the other way is possible. It is possible to have two\\ndifferent X's that output the same value. For example, if this was circled\\nin what would H of negative four be? Well H of negative four when\\nX is equal to negative four, you put that into our function\\nit looks like the function would output two. So H of negative four\\nwould be equal to two. But H of two is also equal\\nto we see very clearly there, when we input a two into the\\nfunction, the corresponding Y value is two as well. So it's okay for two\\ndifferent X values to map to the same Y value that works. But if you had some type of\\nan arrangement, some type of a relationship where\\nfor a given X value you had two different Y values,\\nthen that would no longer be a function. But the example they gave\\nus is a function assuming I don't modify it. \"),\n",

What's the difference between\\nan equation and a function? SALMAN KHAN: Let me think\\nabout it a little bit. So let me think. I think there's\\nprobably equations that are not functions\\nand functions that are not equations. And then there are probably\\nthings that are both. So let me think of it that way. So I'm going to draw-- if\\nthis is the world of equations right over here, so\\nthis is equations. And then over here is\\nthe world of functions. That's the world of functions. I do think there\\nis some overlap. We'll think it through\\nwhere the overlap is, the world of functions. So an equation that is not a\\nfunction that's sitting out here, a simple one would\\nbe something like x plus 3 is equal to 10. I'm not explicitly talking\\nabout inputs and outputs or relationship\\nbetween variables. I'm just stating an equivalence. The expression x plus\\n3 is equal to 10. So this, I think, traditionally\\nwould just be an equation, would not be a function. Functions essentially\\ntalk about relationships between variables. You get one or more\\ninput variables, and we'll give you only\\none output variable. I'll put value. And you can define a function. And I'll do that in a second. You could define a\\nfunction as an equation, but you can define a function\\na whole bunch of ways. You can visually\\ndefine a function, maybe as a graph-- so\\nsomething like this. And maybe I actually\\nmark off the values. So that's 1, 2, 3. Those are the\\npotential x values. And then on the\\nvertical axis, I show what the value of my\\nfunction is going to be, literally my function of x. And maybe that is 1, 2, 3. And maybe this\\nfunction is defined for all non-negative values. So this is 0 of x. And so let me just draw--\\nso this right over here, at least for what I've drawn\\nso far, defines that function. I didn't even have\\nto use an equal sign. If x is 2, at least the way\\nI drew it, y is equal to 3. You give me that input. I gave you the value\\nof only one output. So that would be a legitimate\\nfunction definition. Another function\\ndefinition would be very similar to what you\\ndo in a computer program, something like, let's say, that\\nyou input the day of the week. And if day is equal to Monday,\\nmaybe you output cereal. So that's what we're\\ngoing to eat that day. And otherwise, you\\noutput meatloaf. So this would also\\nbe a function. We only have one output. For any one day of\\nthe week, we can only tell you cereal or meatloaf. There's no days where you\\nare eating both cereal and meatloaf, which\\nsounds repulsive. And then if I were to\\nthink about something that could be an\\nequation or a function, I guess the way I think about\\nit is an equation is something that could be used\\nto define a function. So for example, we could say\\nthat y is equal to 4x minus 10. This is a potential\\ndefinition for defining y as a function of x. You give me any value of x. Then I can find the\\ncorresponding value of y. So this is at least how\\nI would think about it. \"),\n",

Now, to isolate the a here,\\njust to have an a here instead of 4a, we can divide both sides by 4. We can\\ndivide both sides by 4. So I\\'m gonna divide everything by 4. And on the left hand side, we got\\nour goal. We are left with an a is equal to -- Now\\nwhat\\'s negative 54 divided by -- What is the negative 52 divided by 4?\\nSo let\\'s think about it. 52 is 40 plus 12. 40 divided by\\n4 is 10. 12 divided by 4 is 3. So it\\'s gonna be 13. Negative 13.\\nSo it\\'s negative 13 minus 7/4 b minus 7/4 b. So given a \"b\", if you give me a \"b\", I can put\\nthat value right over here, and I can calculate what the\\ncorresponding a needs to be in order to satisfy this relationship. So if I want a formula for f of b in\\nterms of b, I can say, look, you give me a \"b\", the output of our\\nfunction, which is f of a. The output of our function is\\ngoing to be -- is going to be negative 13 minus 7/4 b, because the output of our\\nfunction needs to be an \"a\" that will satisfy -- that will satisfy this equation up here. So hopefully that helped. '),\n",

       "  \"Arjun opened up a savings account last\\nyear and put an initial sum in it. Let M of t\\ndenote the account balance M measured in dollars t days since it was opened. What does\\nthe statement M of 30 minus M of 0 equalling a hundred mean?\\nBefore I look at the choices, let's think about what this means. When you input t equals 30 into your\\nfunction, you're going to get M of 30.\\nSo let me make that clear. So if you say t is equal to 30, you input that into your\\nfunction M. You're going to get -- you're going to\\nget M of 30. So one way to think about it\\nis -- This is the account balance 30 days\\nsince it was opened. This is when t is equal to 30. This is the account balance\\nafter 30 days Let's write that down. Balance -- balance after 30 days. Now, by the same logic, this\\nright over here this is when we put t where we said t equals 0. This is the balance\\nafter 0 days, or you could say this is the initial balance. initial -- initial balance. So what they're doing -- they're taking our\\nbalance after 30 days, and from that they're subtracting the initial\\nbalance and they're saying that equal to 100. So there's a couple ways you can\\ninterpret this and I haven't even looked at these choices yet. We'll see if\\nany of these match up. You could say that your balance after 30\\ndays is a hundred dollars more than the initial balance. Or another way to think about is\\nyou added a hundred dollars in the first 30 days. Those are both legitimate ways to think\\nabout it. I'll see which of these choices are consistent with that. 30 days after it was\\nopened, the balance of Arjun's account was equal to 100. No, that's not what that's\\nsaying. This statement right over here -- the\\nbalance 30 days after opening -- this statement right over here -- this\\nwould be equivalent. This is equivalent to saying that, M of 30 -- this is the balance after 30\\ndays after it was opened -- is equal to 100. That's not what they tell us here.\\nThey tell us that the difference between the balance after 30 days and\\nthe initial balance -- that's a hundred. So we can rule that one out. Arjan had\\nthe initial amount of money in his account 30 days after he opened it. So if he had\\nthe same amount -- if he had the initial amount -- let me write this down. So had the initial\\namount of money -- the initial amount of money is M of 0. So they're saying he had the\\ninitial amount of money in his account 30 days after he opened it. Well, the amount\\nthat he had in his account 30 days after he opened it is M of 30. So these are the same amounts of money\\nthen this -- In order to be consistent with this,\\nyou would have an equation like this. M of 0, the initial amount, is equal to the amount after 30 days.\\nThat's not what they told us over here. We can rule that out. And then finally we have the choice Arjan made a profit\\nover a hundred dollars over the first 30 days since the account\\nwas opened. That seems reasonable that his balance\\nis a hundred dollars higher. The difference between -- if you take the initial\\nbalance and subtract it from his balance after 30 days, it's a hundred. And this right over here is a\\nhundred higher than his initial balance. So it makes sense that maybe he got the\\nprofit out of an interest or something else that he got in his bank account over the\\nfirst 30 days. \"),\n",

So this is saying that the number of people\\nfive hours past midnight is less than the number of people nine\\nhours past midnight at Copacabana beach. So the number of people\\nfive hours past midnight is less than the number people nine\\nhours past midnight. Let's get into these choices.

       "  '- [Voiceover] What I hope\\nto do in this video is get familiar with the notion of an interval, and also think about ways\\nthat we can show an interval, or interval notation. Right over here I have a number line. Let\\'s say I wanted to talk\\nabout the interval on the number line that goes from\\nnegative three to two. So I care about this-- Let\\nme use a different color. Let\\'s say I care about this\\ninterval right over here. I care about all the numbers\\nfrom negative three to two. So in order to be more\\nprecise, I have to be clear. Am I including negative three and two, or am I not including\\nnegative three and two, or maybe I\\'m just including one of them. So if I\\'m including\\nnegative three and two, then I would fill them in. So this right over here, I\\'m\\nfilling negative three and two in, which means that\\nnegative three and two are part of this interval. And when you include the endpoints, this is called a closed interval. Closed interval. And I just showed you how I can depict it on a number line, by actually\\nfilling in the endpoints and there\\'s multiple ways to talk about this interval mathematically. I could say that this is all of the... Let\\'s say this number line is showing different values for x. I could say these are all of the x\\'s that are between negative three and two. And notice, I have negative\\nthree is less than or equal to x so that\\'s telling us\\nthat x could be equal to, that x could be equal to negative three. And then we have x is less\\nthan or equal to positive two, so that means that x could\\nbe equal to positive two, so it is a closed interval. Another way that we could\\ndepict this closed interval is we could say, okay, we\\'re\\ntalking about the interval between, and we can use brackets because it\\'s a closed interval, negative three and two, and once again I\\'m using brackets here,\\nthese brackets tell us that we include, this\\nbracket on the left says that we include negative three,\\nand this bracket on the right says that we include\\npositive two in our interval. Sometimes you might see things written a little bit more math-y. You might see x is a member of\\nthe real numbers such that... And I could put these curly\\nbrackets around like this. These curly brackets say that we\\'re talking about a set of values, and we\\'re saying that the set of all x\\'s that are a member of the real number, so this is just fancy math notation, it\\'s a member of the real numbers. I\\'m using the Greek letter\\nepsilon right over here. It\\'s a member of the\\nreal numbers such that. This vertical line here means \"such that,\" negative three is less x is less than-- negative three is less than or equal to x, is less than or equal to two. I could also write it this way. I could write x is a\\nmember of the real numbers such that x is a member,\\nsuch that x is a member of this closed set, I\\'m\\nincluding the endpoints here. So these are all\\ndifferent ways of denoting or depicting the same interval. Let\\'s do some more examples here. So let\\'s-- Let me draw\\na number line again. So, a number line. And now let me do-- Let me\\njust do an open interval. An open interval just so that we clearly can see the difference. Let\\'s say that I want to talk about the values between negative one and four. Let me use a different color. So the values between\\nnegative one and four, but I don\\'t want to include\\nnegative one and four. So this is going to be an open interval. So I\\'m not going to include four, and I\\'m not going to include negative one. Notice I have open circles here. Over here had closed circles,\\nthe closed circles told me that I included negative three and two. Now I have open circles here,\\nso that says that I\\'m not, it\\'s all the values in\\nbetween negative one and four. Negative .999999 is going to be included, but negative one is not\\ngoing to be included. And 3.9999999 is going to be included, but four is not going to be included. So how would we-- What would be the notation for this? Well, here we could say\\nx is going to be a member of the real numbers\\nsuch that negative one-- I\\'m not going to say less than or equal to because x can\\'t be equal to negative one, so negative one is strictly less than x, is strictly less than four. Notice not less than or\\nequal, because I can\\'t be equal to four, four is not included. So that\\'s one way to say it. Another way I could write it like this. x is a member of the\\nreal numbers such that x is a member of... Now the interval is from\\nnegative one to four but I\\'m not gonna use these brackets. These brackets say, \"Hey,\\nlet me include the endpoint,\" but I\\'m not going to include them, so I\\'m going to put the\\nparentheses right over here. Parentheses. So this tells us that we\\'re\\ndealing with an open interval. This right over here,\\nlet me make it clear, this is an open interval. Now you\\'re probably\\nwondering, okay, in this case both endpoints were included,\\nit\\'s a closed interval. In this case both endpoints were excluded, it\\'s an open interval. Can you have things that\\nhave one endpoint included and one point excluded, and\\nthe answer is absolutely. Let\\'s see an example of that. I\\'ll get another number line here. Another number line. And let\\'s say that we want to-- Actually, let me do it\\nthe other way around. Let me write it first,\\nand then I\\'ll graph it. So let\\'s say we\\'re thinking\\nabout all of the x\\'s that are a member of the\\nreal numbers such that let\\'s say negative four is\\nnot included, is less than x, is less than or equal to negative one. So now negative one is included. So we\\'re not going to\\ninclude negative four. Negative four is strictly less than, not less than or equal to, so x can\\'t be equal to negative\\nfour, open circle there. But x could be equal to negative one. It has to be less than\\nor equal to negative one. It could be equal to negative one so I\\'m going to fill\\nthat in right over there. And it\\'s everything in between. If I want to write it with\\nthis notation I could write x is a member of the\\nreal numbers such that x is a member of the interval, so it\\'s going to go between\\nnegative four and negative one, but we\\'re not including negative four. We have an open circle here so I\\'m gonna put a\\nparentheses on that side, but we are including negative one. We are including negative one. So we put a bracket on that side. That right over there\\nwould be the notation. Now there\\'s other things that you could do with interval notation. You could say, well hey,\\neverything except for some values. Let me give another example. Let\\'s get another example here. Let\\'s say that we wanna talk\\nabout all the real numbers except for one. We want to include all\\nof the real numbers. All of the real numbers except for one. Except for one, so we\\'re gonna\\nexclude one right over here, open circle, but it can\\nbe any other real number. So how would we denote this? Well, we could write x is a\\nmember of the real numbers such that x does not equal one. So here I\\'m saying x can be\\na member of the real numbers but x cannot be equal to one. It can be anything else, but\\nit cannot be equal to one. And there\\'s other ways of\\ndenoting this exact same interval. You could say x is a\\nmember of the real numbers such that x is less than one, or x is greater than one. So you could write it just like that. Or you could do something interesting. This is the one that I would\\nuse, this is the shortest and it makes it very clear. You say hey, everything except for one. But you could even do something\\nfancy, like you could say x is a member of the real\\nnumbers such that x is a member of the set going from\\nnegative infinity to one, not including one, or x is a\\nmember of the set going from-- or a member of the\\ninterval going from one, not including one, all\\nthe way to positive, all the way to positive infinity. And when we\\'re talking\\nabout negative infinity or positive infinity, you\\nalways put a parentheses. And the view there is you\\ncould never include everything all the way up to infinity. It needs to be at least\\nopen at that endpoint because infinity just\\nkeeps going on and on. So you always want to put\\na parentheses if you\\'re talking about infinity\\nor negative infinity. It\\'s not really an endpoint, it keeps going on and on forever. So you use the notation for open interval, at least at that end, and\\nnotice we\\'re not including, we\\'re not including one\\neither, so if x is a member of this interval or that interval, it essentially could be\\nanything other than one. But this would have been\\nthe simplest notation to describe that. '),\n",

       "  \"Let's have a little bit of a review of what\\na function is before we talk about what it means that what the domain of a function means.\\nSo function we can view as something -- so I put a function in this box\\nhere and it takes inputs, and for a given input, it's going to\\nproduce an output which we call f of x. So, for example, let's say that\\nwe have the function -- let's say we have the function f of x is equal to 2 over x. So in this case if -- let me see -- that's my function f. If I were to input the number 3. Well, f of 3 that we're going to output -- we have, we\\nknow how to figure that out. We've defined it right over here. It's going to be\\nequal to 2 over 3. It's going to be equal to 2 over 3. So we're able, for that input, we're\\nable to find an output. If our input was pi, then we input into our function and then\\nf of pi -- when x is pi, we're going to output\\nf of pi, which is equal to 2 over pi. So we\\ncould write this as 2 over pi. We're able to find the output\\npretty easily. But I want to do something interesting. Let's attempt to input 0 into the function. If we input 0 then\\nthe function tells us what we need to output. Does this\\ndefinition tell us what we need to output? So if I attempt to put x equal 0, then this\\ndefinition would say f of 0 be 2 over 0, but 2 over 0 is\\nundefined. Rewrite this -- 2 over 0. This is undefined.\\nThis function definition does not tell us what to actually do with 0. It gives us an\\nundefined answer. So this function is not defined here.\\nIt gives a question mark. So this gets to the essence of what domain is. Domain is the set of all inputs over\\nwhich the function is defined. So the domain of this\\nfunction f would be all real numbers except for x equals 0. So we write down these, these big ideas.\\nThis is the domain -- the domain of a function -- Actually let me write that out. The domain of a function A domain of a function is the set of all inputs -- inputs over which the function is defined -- over which the function is defined,\\nor the function has defined outputs over which the function has defined outputs. So the domain for this f\\nin particular -- so the domain for this one  -- if I want\\nto say its domain, I could say, look, it's going to\\nbe the set of these curly brackets. These are kind of typical mathy set notation. I said OK\\n, it could be the set of -- I gonna put curly brackets like that. Well, x can be a\\nmember So this little symbol means a\\nmember of the real numbers. But it can't be any real number. It could be most of the real numbers except it\\ncannot be 0 because we don't know -- this definition is undefined when\\nyou put the input as 0 So x is a member of the real numbers,\\nand we write real numbers -- we write it with this kind of double stroke right over here.\\nThat's the set of all real numbers such that -- we have to put\\nthe exception. 0 is not a -- x equals to 0 is not a member of that\\ndomain -- such that x does not -- does not equal 0. Now let's make this a little bit\\nmore concrete by do some more examples So more examples we do, hopefully the clearer this will become.\\nSo let's say we have another function. Just be clear, we don't\\nalways have to use f's and x's. We could say, let's say we\\nhave g of y is equal to the square root of y minus 6. So what is the domain here? What is the set of all inputs over which this function g\\nis defined? So here we are in putting a y it to function g and we're gonna output g of y. Well it's going to be defined\\nas long as whatever we have under the radical right over here is non-negative. If this becomes a\\nnegative, our traditional principal root operator here is not defined. We need something that --\\nif this was a negative number, how would you take the principal\\nroot of a negative number? We just think this is kind of the the\\ntraditional principal root operator. So y minus 6, y minus 6 needs to be greater than or equal to 0, in order for, in order for g\\nto be defined for that input y. Or you could say add six to both sides.\\ny is to be greater than or equal 6. Or you could say g is defined for any inputs\\ny that are greater than or equal to 6. So you could say the domain here, we\\ncould say the domain here is the set of all y's that are members of\\nthe real numbers such that y, such that they're also\\ngreater than or equal, such that they're also greater than or equal to 6. So hopefully\\nthis is starting to make some sense -- You're all used to a function that is\\ndefined this way. You could even see functions that are divided fairly exotic ways. You could see a\\nfunction -- let me say h of x -- h of x could be defined as -- it literally\\ncould be defined as, well h of x is gonna be 1 if x is equal to pi and it's equal to 0 if, if, x is equal to 3. Now what's the domain\\nhere? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Well, this function is actually only\\ndefined for two input. If you, we know h of -- we know h of pi --\\nif you input pi into it we know you're gonna output 1, and\\nwe know that if you input 3 into it h of 3, when x equals 3, you're going to\\n-- you're going to -- put some commas here. You're gonna get 0.\\nBut if you input anything else, what's h of 4 going to be? Well, it hasn't defined. It's undefined.\\nWhat's h of negative 1 going to be? It hasn't defined. So the domain, the domain here, the domain of h is literally -- it's just literally\\ngoing to be the the two valid inputs that x can be are 3 and pi. These are the only valid inputs.\\nThese are the only two numbers over which this function is actually defined.\\nSo this hopefully starts to give you a flavor of why we care about to the domain.\\nIt's not all functions are defined over all real numbers. Some are defined \\nfor only a small subset of real numbers, or for some other\\nthing, or only whole numbers, or natural numbers, or positive numbers, and negative\\nnumbers. So they have exceptions. So we'll see that as we do\\nmore and more examples. \"),\n",

       "  '- As a little bit of\\na review, we know that if we have some function,\\nlet\\'s call it \"f\". We don\\'t have to call it\\n\"f\", but \"f\" is the letter most typically used for functions, that if I give it an input, a valid input, if I give it a valid input,\\nand I use the variable \"x\" for that valid input, it is\\ngoing to map that to an output. It is going to map that, or produce, given this x, it\\'s going\\nto product an output that we would call \"f(x).\" And we\\'ve already talked a little bit about the notion of a domain. A domain is the set of all of the inputs over which the function is defined. So if this the domain here,\\nif this is the domain here, and I take a value here,\\nand I put that in for x, then the function is\\ngoing to output an f(x). If I take something that\\'s\\noutside of the domain, let me do that in a different color... If I take something that\\nis outside of the domain and try to input it into this function, the function will say, \"hey, wait wait,\" \"I\\'m not defined for that thing\" \"that\\'s outside of the domain.\" Now another interesting\\nthing to think about, and that\\'s actually what\\nthe focus of this video is, okay, we know the set of\\nall of the valid inputs, that\\'s called the domain,\\nbut what about all, the set of all of the\\noutputs that the function could actually produce? And we have a name for that. That is called the range of the function. So the range. The range, and the most typical, there\\'s actually a couple\\nof definitions for range, but the most typical definition for range is \"the set of all possible outputs.\" So you give me, you input\\nsomething from the domain, it\\'s going to output\\nsomething, and by definition, because we have outputted\\nit from this function, that thing is going to be in the range, and if we take the set\\nof all of the things that the function could output, that is going to make up the range. So this right over here is\\nthe set of all possible, all possible outputs. All possible outputs. So let\\'s make that a\\nlittle bit more concrete, with an example. So let\\'s say that I have the function f(x) defined as, so once again,\\nI\\'m gonna input x\\'s, and I have my function f,\\nand I\\'m gonna output f(x). And let\\'s say this def... The function definition\\nhere, the thing that tries to figure out, \"okay, given an\\nx, what f(x) do I produce?\", the definition says \"f(x)\\nis going to be equal\" \"to whatever my input is, squared.\" Well, just as a little bit of review, we know what the domain\\nhere is going to be. The domain is the set of all valid inputs. So what are the valid inputs here? Well, I could take any real number and input into this, and I\\ncould take any real number and I can square it, there\\'s\\nnothing wrong with that, and so the domain is all real numbers. All, all real, all real numbers. But what\\'s the range? Maybe I\\'ll do that in a different color just to highlight it. What is going to be the range here, what is the set of all possible outputs? Well if you think about, actually, to help us think about, let\\nme actually draw a graph here. Of what this looks like. What this looks like. So the graph of \"f(x)\\nis equal to x squared\" is going to look something like this. So, it\\'s gonna look, it\\'s going\\nto look something like this. I\\'m obviously hand-drawing\\nit, so it\\'s not perfect. It\\'s gonna be a parabola with a, with a vertex right here at the origin. So this is the graph, this is the graph, \"y is equal to f(x),\" this\\nof course is the x-axis, this of course is the y-axis. So let\\'s think about it, what is the set of all possible outputs? Well in this case, the set\\nof all possible outputs is the set of all possible y\\'s here. Well, we see, y can take\\non any non-negative value. y could be zero, y could one,\\ny could be pi, y could be e, but y cannot be negative. So the range here is, the range... We could, well we could\\nsay it a couple of ways, we could say, \"f(x)\",\\nlet me write it this way. \"f(x) is a member of the real numbers\" \"such that, is such that\\nf(x) is greater than\" \"or equal to zero.\" We could write it that\\nway, if we wanted to write it in a less mathy notation, we could say that \"f(x) is going to be\" \"greater than or equal to zero.\" f(x) is not going to be negative, so any non-negative number, the set of all non-negative numbers, that is our range. Let\\'s do another example of this, just to make it a little bit,\\njust to make it a little bit, a little bit clearer. Let\\'s say that I had,\\nlet\\'s say that I had g(x), let\\'s say I have g(x),\\nI\\'ll do this in white, let\\'s say it\\'s equal\\nto \"x squared over x.\" So we could try to\\nsimplify g(x) a little bit, we could say, \"look, if I have x squared\" \"and I divide it by x, that\\'s gonna,\" \"that\\'s the same thing as\\ng(x) being equal to x.\" \"x squared over x\" is x,\\nbut we have to be careful. Because right over here, we have to, in our domain, x cannot be equal to zero. If x is equal to zero,\\nwe get zero over zero, we get indeterminate form. So in order for this function\\nto be the exact same function, we have to put that,\\n\\'cause it\\'s not obvious now from the definition, we have to say, \"x cannot be equal to zero.\" So g(x) is equal to x for any x as long as x is not equal to zero. Now these two function\\ndefinitions are equivalent. And we could even graph it. We could graph it, it\\'s going to look, I\\'m gonna do a quick and\\ndirty version of this graph. It\\'s gonna look something like, this. It\\'s gonna have a slope of one, but it\\'s gonna have a hole right at zero, \\'cause it\\'s not defined at zero. So it\\'s gonna look like this. So the domain here, the domain of g is going to be, \"x is a\\nmember of the real numbers\" \"such that x does not equal zero,\" and the range is actually\\ngoing to be the same thing. The range here is going to be, we could say \"f(x) is a\\nmember of the real numbers\" \"such that f(x) does not equal zero.\" \"f(x) does not equal zero.\" So the domain is all real\\nnumbers except for zero, the range is all real\\nnumbers except for zero. So the big takeaway here is\\nthe range is all the pos... The set of all possible\\noutputs of your function. The domain is the set of all valid inputs into your function. '),\n",

And then it keeps\\ngetting defined. f of x is defined for x all\\nthe way from x equals negative 6 all the\\nway to x equals 7. When x equals 7, f\\nof x is equal to 5. You can take any x value\\nbetween negative 6, including negative\\n6, and positive 7, including positive\\n7, and you just have to see-- you\\njust have to move up above that number,\\nwherever you are, to find out what the value of\\nthe function is at that point. So the domain of this\\nfunction definition? Well, f of x is\\ndefined for any x that is greater than or\\nequal to negative 6. Or we could say negative 6\\nis less than or equal to x, which is less than\\nor equal to 7. If x satisfies this\\ncondition right over here, the function is defined. So that's its domain. So let's check our answer. Let's do a few more of these. The function f of x is graphed. What is its domain? Well, exact similar argument. This function is not defined\\nfor x is negative 9, negative 8, all the way down or all the way\\nup I should say to negative 1. At negative 1, it\\nstarts getting defined. f of negative 1 is negative 5. So it's defined for negative\\n1 is less than or equal to x. And it's defined all the\\nway up to x equals 7, including x equals 7. So this right over\\nhere, negative 1 is less than or equal to x\\nis less than or equal to 7, the function is\\ndefined for any x that satisfies this double\\ninequality right over here. Let's do a few more. The function f of x is graphed. What is its range? So now, we're not\\nthinking about the x's for which this\\nfunction is defined. We're thinking about\\nthe set of y values. Where do all of the\\ny values fall into? Well, let's see. The lowest possible y value\\nor the lowest possible value of f of x that we get\\nhere looks like it's 0. The function never goes below 0. So f of x-- so 0 is less\\nthan or equal to f of x. It does equal 0 right over\\nhere. f of negative 4 is 0. And then the highest y\\nvalue or the highest value that f of x obtains in this\\nfunction definition is 8. f of 7 is 8. It never gets above 8, but it\\ndoes equal 8 right over here when x is equal to 7. So 0 is less than f of x, which\\nis less than or equal to 8. So that's its range. Let's do a few more. This is kind of fun. The function f of x is graphed. What is its domain? So once again, this function\\nis defined for negative 2. Negative 2 is less than or\\nequal to x, which is less than or equal to 5. If you give me an x anywhere\\nin between negative 2 and 5, I can look at this graph to see\\nwhere the function is defined. f of negative 2 is negative 4. f of negative 1 is negative 3. So on and so forth,\\nand I can even pick the values in\\nbetween these integers. So negative 2 is less than or\\nequal to x, which is less than or equal to 5. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're asked\\nto determine for each x-value whether it is in the domain of f or not. And they have our definition\\nof f of x up here. So pause this video and see\\nif you can work through this before we do it together. All right, so just as a bit of a review, if x is in the domain of our function, that means that if we input\\nour x into our function, when we are going to get a\\nlegitimate output f of x. But if for whatever reason\\nf isn't defined at x or it gets some kind of undefined state, well, then x would not be in the domain. So let's try these different values. Is x equal to negative\\nfive in the domain of f? Well, let's see what happens if we try to evaluate f of negative five. Well, then in the numerator,\\nwe get negative five plus five. Every place where we see an x, we replace it with a negative five. So it's negative five plus five, over negative five minus\\nthree, which is equal to in our numerator, we get zero, and in our denominator,\\nwe get negative eight. Now, at first you see the zero, and you might get a little bit worried, but it's just a zero in the numerator, so this whole thing just\\nevaluates to a zero, which is a completely legitimate output. So x equals negative\\nfive is in the domain. What about x equals zero? Is that in the domain? Pause the video. See if you can figure that out. Well, f of zero is going to be equal to in our numerator, we have zero plus five, and in our denominator,\\nwe have zero minus three. Well, that's just going to\\nget us five in the numerator and negative three in the denominator. This would just be negative 5/3. But this is a completely\\nlegitimate output. So the function is\\ndefined at x equals zero, so it's in the domain for sure. Now what about x equals three? Pause the video and\\ntry to figure that out. Well, I'll do that up here. f of three is going to be equal to what? And you might already\\nsee some warning signs as to what's going to happen\\nhere in the denominator, but I'll just evaluate the whole thing. In the numerator, we get three plus five. In the denominator, we\\nget three minus three. So this is going to be\\nequal to eight over zero. Now what is eight divided by zero? Well, we don't know. This is one of those fascinating\\nthings in mathematics. We haven't defined what happens when something is divided by zero. So three is not in the domain. The function is not defined\\nthere, not in domain. Let's do another example. Determine for each x-value whether it is in the domain of g or not. So pause this video and try to work through\\nall three of these. So first of all, when x\\nequals negative three, do we get a legitimate g of x? So let's see. g of negative three, if\\nwe try to evaluate this, that's going to be the square root of three times negative three, which is equal to the square\\nroot of negative nine. Well, with just a principle\\nsquare root like this, we don't know how to evaluate this. So this is not in the domain. What about when x equals zero? Well, g of zero is going to be equal to the square root of three times zero, which is equal to the square root of zero, which is equal to zero, so that gave us a legitimate result. So that is in the domain. Now what about g of two, or x equals two? Does that give us a legitimate g of two? Well, g of two is going to\\nbe equal to the square root of three times two, which is\\nequal to the square root of six which is a legitimate output. So x equals two is in the domain. Let's do one last example. So we're told, this h\\nof x right over here, and once again, we have\\nto figure out whether these x-values are in the domain or not. Pause this video and see if\\nyou can work through that. All right, well, let's\\njust first think about h of negative one. What's that going to be equal to? Negative one, every place we see an x, we're going to replace\\nit with a negative one, minus five, squared. Well, this is going to be\\nequal to negative six squared, negative six squared, which\\nis equal to positive 36, which is a very legitimate output, and so this is definitely in the domain. What about five? So h of five is going to be equal to five minus five squared. Now you might be getting worried 'cause you're seeing a zero here, but it's not like we're\\ntrying to divide by zero. We're just squaring zero, which is completely legitimate. So zero squared is just a zero, and so h of five is very much defined. So this is in the domain. Now what about h of 10? Well, h of 10 is going to be\\nequal to 10 minus five squared, which is equal to five\\nsquared, which is equal to 25. Once again, it's a very legitimate output. So the function is definitely\\ndefined for x equals 10, and we're done. \"),\n",
       " ('8.6.2',\n",
       "  \"- [Instructor] In this video, we're gonna do a few examples finding domains of functions. So let's say that we\\nhave the function f of x is equal to x plus five over x minus two. What is going to be the domain of this function? Pause this video and\\ntry to figure that out. All right, now let's do it together. Now the domain is the set of all x values that if we input it into this function, we're going to get a legitimate output. We're going to get a legitimate f of x. And so what's a situation\\nwhere we would not get a legitimate f of x? Well, if we input an x value that makes this denominator equal to zero, then we're going to divide by zero and that's going to be undefined. And so we could say that the domain, the domain here is all real values of x, such that x minus two does not equal zero. Now typically, people\\nwould not want to just see that such that x minus\\ntwo does not equal zero, and so we can simplify this a little bit so that we just have an\\nx on the left hand side. So if we add two to both sides of this, we would get, actually,\\nlet me just do that. Let me add two to both sides. So x minus two not equaling zero is the same thing as x not equaling two, and you could have done\\nthat in your head, as well. If you wanted to keep x\\nminus two from being zero, x just can't be equal to two, and so typically, people\\nwould say that the domain here is all real values of x such that x does not equal two. Let's do another example. Let's say that we're told that g of x is equal to the principle\\nroot of x minus seven. What's the domain in this situation? What's the domain of g of x? Pause the video and\\ntry to figure that out. Well, we could say that domain, the domain is going to\\nbe all real values of x such that, are we going to have to put any constraints on this? Well when does a principle\\nroot function break down? Well if we tried to\\nfind the principle root, the square root of a negative number, well, that would then break down, and so x minus seven, whatever we have under the radical here needs to be greater than or equal to zero, so such that x minus seven needs to be greater than or equal to zero. Now another way to say\\nthat is if we add seven to both sides of that, that would be saying that\\nx needs to be greater than or equal to seven, so let me just write it that way. So such that x is greater than or equal to seven. So all I did is I said, all right, where could this thing break down? Well, if I get x values\\nwhere this thing is negative, we're in trouble, so x needs to be greater, x minus seven, whatever we have in this, under the radical needs to be greater than or equal to zero, and so if you say that x minus seven needs to be greater than or equal to zero, you add seven to both sides. You get x needs to be greater than or equal to positive seven. Let's do one last example. Let's say we're told that h of x is equal to x minus five squared. What's the domain here? So let me write this down. The domain is all real values of x. Now are we going to have to\\nconstrain this a little bit? Well, is there anything\\nthat would cause this to not evaluate to a defined value? Well, we can square any value. To give me any real\\nnumber and if I square it, I'm gonna just get another real number, and so x minus five can\\nbe equal to anything, and so x can be equal to anything. So here, the domain is\\nall real values of x. We didn't have to constrain it in any way like we did the other two. The other two, when\\nyou deal with something in the denominator that\\ncould be equal to zero, then you've got to make\\nsure that doesn't happen 'cause that would get\\nyou an undefined value and similarly, for a radical, you can't take the\\nsquare root of a negative and so we would, once again, have to constrain on that. \"),\n",

And the inputs here, this is t and\\nit represents days and if I input t, the number of days,\\ninto the function h, it'll output the height of the plant. So let's\\nthink about it.

So t would be a member of\\nreal numbers such that it is a member of this\\n-- of this interval right over here.

Which number type is more appropriate\\nfor the domain of the function? So just to remind ourselves, what is the domain of a function? A domain is a set of all inputs over which the function is\\ndefined. So it is the set of all b's. It is the set of\\nall inputs over which p of b will produce a\\ndefined response So let's think about it. Is it integers or\\nreal numbers? So I could buy -- b could be 0 candy bars, 1 candy bars, 2 candy bars, all up to 400 candy bars. Could I -- Could I have a fractional can-- \\nCould be b 0.372 of a candy bar? Well, this is a normal candy shop. It's -- each candy bar is gonna be in its own packet. It's going to be in a discrete chunk. You're not going to be able to buy\\n0.372 of a candy bar. You can either buy a one\\nmore or none more, so you buy your 1, 2, 3 all the way up to 400.

It\\'s a vertical ladder, that\\'s one side of the ladder, this is the other side of the ladder, and it has 15 steps. Let me see if I can draw that. This is the first one, two, three, four. I\\'m gonna run out of space, I need to make \\'em closer together. It\\'s gonna be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. 15 steps. Let me make sure it\\'s even. The top and the bottom, and the distance between each of these, I guess you could say, steps,\\nor the rungs of the ladder, are half a meter. This distance right\\nover here is 0.5 meters. And it says that he\\'s on the 5th step of this vertical ladder. He\\'s on the 5th step, One, two, three, four, five. This is where he is right\\nnow. He\\'s on this 5th step. And he\\'s thinking about moving up, or down, or staying put. \"Let h of n denote the\\nheight above the ground h \"of Mason\\'s feet (measured in meters) \"after moving n steps (if Mason went \"down the ladder, n is negative.)\" All right, h of n. Denote the height above the ground after moving n steps. Make sure we understand this. If I were to say h of zero, what is that going to be? Well, h of zero means that\\nhe\\'s moved zero steps. He\\'s moved zero steps,\\nhe\\'s still going to be on this 5th step of the ladder. And so how high is he going to be? If he\\'s on the 5th step\\nof a vertical ladder... I\\'m assuming that there\\'s\\n0.5 from the ground. This is the ground right over here. He is one, two, three, four, five steps, each of \\'em is half a meter. Five times 0.5 is going to give us 2.5 meters, so h of zero is 2.5 meters. If I said h of one, that means he goes up. H of one means he goes up one step. Here, n would be equal to one. If he goes up one step, h of one, he\\'s going to half a meter higher, so it\\'s going to be equal to three meters. We could keep doing that for\\na bunch of different inputs. Let me write that, that\\'s going\\nto be equal to three meters. But anyway, that\\'s not what\\nthey\\'re asking us about. They\\'re saying, \"Which number\\ntype is more appropriate \"for the domain of the function?\" The domain, just as\\nreviewed, that\\'s the set of numbers that we could\\ninput into the function and get a valid output. And it\\'s clear here, see, we have to pick between integers or real numbers. Well, n, which is our input, that\\'s the number of\\nsteps he goes up or down. It could be positive or negative, but we\\'re not gonna talk about half steps. Then he\\'ll put his foot\\nin the air, right over. He has to take integer\\nvalued steps up or down. Or, I guess, he\\'s taking\\ninteger valued steps, if it\\'s positive it\\'s up,\\nif it\\'s negative it\\'s down, if it\\'s zero that means he\\'s staying put. If n is zero, that means he\\'s staying put. It\\'s not real numbers. He can\\'t move pi steps from where he is. He can\\'t move square root of\\ntwo steps from where he is. He can\\'t even move 0.25 steps, then he\\'d put his foot in the air. This is definitely going\\nto be about the integers, not the real numbers. This function right over\\nhere, the valid inputs, I want to be able to input an integer. In fact, it\\'s not even all integers, because he can\\'t go down\\nan arbitrary amount. In fact, he can\\'t go up an\\narbitrary amount either. The domain is going to\\nbe a subset of integers. Then they say, \"Define the\\ninterval of the domain.\" And we have these little toggles here... to define the interval of the domain. And let\\'s see, the lowest value for n, he can go as far as one, two, three, four, five steps down. In that case, n would be\\nequal to negative five. And then the highest value for n is if he takes one, two,\\nthree, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 steps up. And so that would be n is equal to 10. The interval of the domain, and actually I just copy and pasted this onto my scratch pad, n can be as low as negative\\nfive, and as high as 10, and it can include them as well, so I\\'m gonna use brackets. My domain would include negative five. If it didn\\'t include negative five, I would put a parentheses,\\nbut I could put brackets here, and I could put brackets there as well. Just for fun, let me actually input it into the actual exercise. I\\'m saying integers, and I\\'m as low, and I can go down five steps, and I can go up 10 steps, and 10 is also included in my interval. Then I can check my\\nanswer, and I got it right. '),\n",

Now, just as a\\nrefresher, a function is really just an association\\nbetween members of a set that we call the domain\\nand members of the set that we call a range. So if I take any member of\\nthe domain, let's call that x, and I give it to the\\nfunction, the function should tell me what member of\\nmy range is associated with it. So it should point\\nto some other value. This is a function. It would not be a\\nfunction if it says, well, it could point to y. Or it could point to z. Or maybe it could point\\nto e or whatever else. This would not be a function. So this right over\\nhere not a function, because it's not clear if\\nyou input x what member of the range you're\\ngoing to get. In order for it\\nto be a function, it has to be very clear. For any input into\\nthe function, you have to be very clear\\nthat you're only going to get one output. Now, with that out of\\nthe way, let's think about this function that\\nis defined graphically. So the domains,\\nthe valid inputs, are the x values where\\nthis function is defined. So for example, it tells us\\nif x is equal to negative 1-- if we assume that this\\nover here is the x-axis and this is the\\ny-axis-- it tells us, when x is equal to negative\\n1, we should output. Or y is going to be equal to 3. So one way to write\\nthat mapping is you could say, if you\\ntake negative 1 and you input it into\\nour function-- I'll put a little f box right over\\nthere-- you will get the number 3. This is our x. And this is our y. So that seems reasonable. Negative 1 very clear\\nthat you get to 3. Let's see what happens\\nwhen we go over here. If you put 2 into the function,\\nwhen x is 2, y is negative 2. Once again, when x\\nis 2 the function associates 2 for x, which\\nis a member of the domain. It's defined for 2. It's not defined for 1. We don't know what our\\nfunction is equal to at 1. So it's not defined there. So 1 isn't part of the domain. 2 is. It tells us when\\nx is 2, then y is going to be equal to negative 2. So it maps it or associates\\nit with negative 2. That doesn't seem too\\ntroublesome just yet. Now, let's look over here. Our function is also\\ndefined at x is equal to 3. Our function associates or maps\\n3 to the value y is equal to 2. That seems pretty\\nstraightforward. And then we get to x\\nis equal to 4, where it seems like this thing\\nthat could be a function is somewhat defined. It does try to\\nassociate 4 with things. But what's interesting here\\nis it tries to associate 4 with two different things. All of a sudden in this\\nthing that we think might have been a\\nfunction, but it looks like it might\\nnot be, we don't know. Do we associate 4 with 5? Or do we associate\\nit with negative 1? So this thing right over\\nhere is actually a relation. You can have one member of\\nthe domain being related to multiple members\\nof the range. But if you do have\\nthat, then you're not dealing with a function. So once again, because of\\nthis, this is not a function. It's not clear that when\\nyou input 4 into it, should you output 5? Or should you output negative 1? And sometimes there's something\\ncalled the vertical line test that tells you whether\\nsomething is a function. When it's graphically defined\\nlike this, you literally say, OK, when x is 4, if\\nI draw a vertical line, do I intersect the function\\nat two places or more? It could be two or more places. And if you do, that means that\\nthere's two or more values that are related to that\\nvalue in the domain. There's two or more\\noutputs for the input 4. And if there are two or more\\noutputs for that one input, then you're not dealing\\nwith a function. You're just dealing\\nwith a relation. A function is a special\\ncase of a relation.

And then if I were to plot the\\ndifferent names, the different people that I could put into our\\nheight function, we have-- I'll just put the first letters\\nof their names. We have Joelle, we have Nathan,\\nwe have Stewart, we have LJ, and then we have\\nTariq right there. So lets plot them. So you have Joelle, Joelle's\\nheight is 5-6, so 5-6 is right about there. Then you have Nathan. Let me do it in a\\ndifferent color. Nathan's height is 4-11. We will plot to him\\nright over there. Then you have Stewart. Stewart's height is 5-11. He is pretty close\\nto six feet. So Stewart's height-- I made him\\nlike six feet; let me make it a little lower-- is 5-11. Then you have LJ. LJ's height is 5-6. So you have two people with a\\nheight of 5-6, but that's OK, as long as for each person\\nyou only have one height. And then finally, Tariq\\nis 6 foot 1. He's the tallest guy here. Tariq is right up here\\nat 6 foot 1. So notice, for any one of the\\ninputs into our function, we only have one value, so this is\\na functional relationship. Now, you might say OK, well,\\nisn't everything a functional relationship? No! If I gave you the situation, if\\nI also wrote here-- let's say the table was like this and\\nI also wrote that Stewart is 5 foot 3 inches. If this was our table, then\\nwe would no longer have a functional relationship because\\nfor the input of Stewart, we would have\\ntwo different values. If we were to graph this, we\\nhave Stewart here at 5-11, and then all of a sudden, we would\\nalso have Stewart at 5-3. Now, this doesn't make a lot of\\nsense, so we would plot it right over here. So for Stewart, you would have\\ntwo values, and so this wouldn't be a valid functional\\nrelationship because you wouldn't know what value to give\\nif you were to take the height of Stewart. In order for this to be a\\nfunction, there can only be one value for this. You don't know in this situation\\nwhen I add this, whether it's 5-3 or 5-11. Now, this wasn't the case, so\\nthat isn't there and so we know that the height of Stewart\\nis 5-11 and this is a functional relationship. I think to some level, it might\\nbe confusing, because it's such a simple idea. Each of these values can\\nonly have one height associated with it. That's what makes\\nit a function. If you had more than one height\\nassociated with it, it would not be a function. \"),\n",

So they're saying,\\ncan the dollar amount of the order-- so can\\nthe amount of order be represented as a\\nfunction of shipping-- let me do that in\\nthat blue color costs. So if we have the shipping\\ncosts as an input, will that map to exactly--\\nfor a given input, will we get exactly one output\\nfor the amount of order? In order for this to be\\nrepresented as a function, we have to input a shipping\\ncost, a shipping cost where this relationship\\nis defined. We need to input\\na shipping cost, put it into our relationship,\\nand get exactly one dollar amount of the order in order\\nfor this to be a function. If we get multiple dollar\\namounts of the order, then the relationship, well,\\nit's still a relationship, but it's not going\\nto be a function. So let's think about it. What are the\\npossible inputs here? Well, there's only two\\npossible shipping costs. Shipping costs are\\neither going to be $4, or they're going to be $7. So let's think\\nabout what happens when we input $4 in\\nas a shipping cost. So if we input $4\\ninto our relationship, so we input $4 into our\\nlittle potential function box, so $4 into it,\\nwhat is the output? What is going to be the\\namount of the order? Well, if the shipping cost is\\n$4, the amount of the order just has to be\\nanything less than $20. So it could have been $1. It could have been $1.50. It could've been $7. It literally can take\\non any value up to $20. So it could even be $19.99. We could do a similar\\nthing if we input 7 into this relationship.

So if I input 7 into\\nthis relationship that we're trying to test\\nwhether it's a function, if 7 is the shipping costs,\\nthen the order we just know is over $20, $20 or more. So it could be $20.

       "  \"So right over here I've\\ngraphed the function y is equal to f of x. I've graphed over this interval. It looks like it's between\\n0 and some positive value. And I want to think about the\\nmaximum and minimum points on this. So we've already talked a little\\nbit about absolute maximum and absolute minimum\\npoints on an interval. And those are pretty obvious. We hit a maximum\\npoint right over here, right at the beginning\\nof our interval. It looks like when\\nx is equal to 0, this is the absolute maximum\\npoint for the interval. And the absolute minimum\\npoint for the interval happens at the other endpoint. So if this a, this is b,\\nthe absolute minimum point is f of b. And the absolute\\nmaximum point is f of a. And it looks like\\na is equal to 0. But you're probably\\nthinking, hey, there are other interesting\\npoints right over here. This point right over\\nhere, it isn't the largest. We're not taking on--\\nthis value right over here is definitely not\\nthe largest value. It is definitely not\\nthe largest value that the function takes\\non in that interval. But relative to the\\nother values around it, it seems like a\\nlittle bit of a hill. It's larger than the other ones. Locally, it looks like a\\nlittle bit of a maximum. And so that's why this\\nvalue right over here would be called-- let's\\nsay this right over here c. This is c, so this is\\nf of c-- we would call f of c is a relative\\nmaximum value. And we're saying relative\\nbecause obviously the function takes on the other values\\nthat are larger than it. But for the x values\\nnear c, f of c is larger than all of those. Similarly-- I can\\nnever say that word. Similarly, if this point\\nright over here is d, f of d looks like a relative\\nminimum point or a relative minimum value. f of d is a relative minimum\\nor a local minimum value. Once again, over\\nthe whole interval, there's definitely\\npoints that are lower. And we hit an absolute\\nminimum for the interval at x is equal to b. But this is a relative\\nminimum or a local minimum because it's lower\\nthan the-- if we look at the x values around d,\\nthe function at those values is higher than when we get to d. So let's think about,\\nit's fine for me to say, well, you're at a\\nrelative maximum if you hit a larger\\nvalue of your function than any of the\\nsurrounding values. And you're at a\\nminimum if you're at a smaller value than any\\nof the surrounding areas. But how could we write\\nthat mathematically? So here I'll just give\\nyou the definition that really is just\\na more formal way of saying what we just said. So we say that f of\\nc is a relative max, relative maximum\\nvalue, if f of c is greater than or\\nequal to f of x for all x that-- we could say in a\\ncasual way, for all x near c. So we could write it like that. But that's not too\\nrigorous because what does it mean to be near c? And so a more rigorous\\nway of saying it, for all x that's within an\\nopen interval of c minus h to c plus h, where h is\\nsome value greater than 0. So does that make sense? Well, let's look at it. So let's construct\\nan open interval. So it looks like for\\nall of the x values in-- and you just have to\\nfind one open interval. There might be many open\\nintervals where this is true. But if we construct\\nan open interval that looks something like that,\\nso this value right over here is c plus h. That value right\\nover here c minus h. And you see that\\nover that interval, the function at c,\\nf of c is definitely greater than or equal to\\nthe value of the function over any other part\\nof that open interval. And so you could\\nimagine-- I encourage you to pause the video,\\nand you could write out what the more formal definition\\nof a relative minimum point would be. Well, we would just\\nwrite-- let's take d as our relative minimum. We can say that f of d is\\na relative minimum point if f of d is less\\nthan or equal to f of x for all x in an\\ninterval, in an open interval, between d minus h and d plus\\nh for h is greater than 0. So you can find\\nan interval here. So let's say this is d plus h. This is d minus h. The function over that\\ninterval, f of d is always less than or equal to\\nany of the other values, the f's of all of these\\nother x's in that interval. And that's why we say that\\nit's a relative minimum point. So in everyday\\nlanguage, relative max-- if the function takes\\non a larger value at c than for the x values around c. And you're at a\\nrelative minimum value if the function takes\\non a lower value at d than for the\\nx values near d. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're asked to mark all the relative extremum\\npoints in the graph below. So pause the video and see\\nif you can have a go at that, just try to maybe look at the screen and, in your head see if you can\\nidentify the relative extrema. So now let's do this together. So there's two types of relative extrema. You have your relative maximum points, and you have your relative minimum points. And a relative maximum\\npoint or relative minimum, they're relatively easy\\n(laughing) to spot out visually. You will see a relative maximum point as the high point on a hill, and the hill itself\\ndoesn't even have to be the highest hill. For example the curve\\ncould go at other parts of the domain of the function, could go to higher values. It could also look like\\nthe peak of a mountain, and once again since we're talking about the relative maximum, this mountain peak doesn't\\nhave to be the highest mountain peak. There could be higher mountains, and actually each of these peaks, each of these peaks would\\nbe a relative maximum point. Now relative minima are the opposite. They would be the bottom of your valleys. So that's a relative minimum point. This right over here is\\na relative minimum point, even if there are other\\nparts of the function that are lower. Now there's also an edge\\ncase for both relative maxima and relative minima, and that's where the graph is flat. So if you have parts\\nof your function where it's just constant, these points would actually be both. For example, if this is our x-axis right over here, that's our x-axis, if this is our y-axis right over there, and if this is x equals c, if you construct an\\nopen interval around c, you notice that the value\\nof our function at c, f of c, is at least as large as the values of the function around it. And it is also at least as small as the values of the function around it, so this point would also be considered a relative minimum point. But that's an edge case that\\nyou won't encounter as often. So with that primer out of the way, let's identify the relative extrema. So first the relative maximum points. Well that's a top of a\\nhill right over there, this is the top of a hill. You might be tempted to look\\nat that point and that point, but notice, at this point right over here, if you go to the right, you have values that are higher than it. So it's really not at the top of a hill. And right over if you go to the left, you have values that are higher than it, so it's also not the top of a hill. And what about the\\nrelative minimum points? Well this one right over here\\nis a relative minimum point. This one right over here is\\na relative minimum point. And this one over here is a relative minimum point. Now let's do an example\\ndealing with absolute extrema. So here we're told to\\nmark the absolute maximum and the absolute minimum points in the graph below. So once again, pause this video and see if\\nyou can have a go at this. So you have an absolute maximum point at let's say x equals c if and only if, so I'll write iff for if and only if, f of c is greater than or equal to f of x for all the x's in\\nthe domain of the function. And you have an absolute minimum at x equals c if and only if, iff, f of c is less than or equal to f of x for all the x's over the domain. So another way to think about it is, absolute maximum point is the high point. So over here, that is the\\nabsolute maximum point. And then the absolute\\nminimum point is interesting because in this case, it would be actually one of, it would happen at one of\\nthe endpoints of our domain. So that is our absolute max, and this right over here is our absolute, absolute min. Now once again there is an edge case that you will not see too frequently. So for example, if this function did something like this, so if it went up like this, and then it just stayed flat like this, then this would no longer be an absolute maximum point. But any of these points\\nin this flat region, because they are at least\\nas high as any other points on our entire curve, any of those could be considered\\nabsolute maximum points. But we aren't dealing with\\nthat edge case in this example, and you're less likely to see that. And so in most problems, it's pretty easy to pick out. Because the absolute\\nhighest point on the curve will often be your absolute maximum, and the absolute lowest\\npoint on your curve will be your absolute minimum. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] What I\\nhope to do in this video is look at this graph y is equal to f of x and think about the intervals where this graph is positive or negative and then think about the intervals when this graph is\\nincreasing or decreasing. So first let's just think\\nabout when is this function, when is this function positive? Well positive means that the value of the function is greater than zero. It means that the value\\nof the function this means that the function is\\nsitting above the x-axis. So it's sitting above the x-axis in this place right over here that I am highlighting in\\nyellow and it is also sitting above the x-axis over here. And if we wanted to, if we wanted to write those intervals mathematically. Well let's see, let's say that this point, let's say that this point\\nright over here is x equals a. Let's say that this right\\nover here is x equals b and this right over here is x equals c. Then it's positive, it's\\npositive as long as x is between a and b. At x equals a or at x equals b the value of our function is zero but it's positive when x is between a and b, a and b or if x is greater than c. X is, we could write it\\nthere, c is less than x or we could write that\\nx is greater than c. These are the intervals when\\nour function is positive. Let me write this, f of x, f of x positive when x is in this\\ninterval or this interval or that interval. So when is f of x negative? Let me do this in another color. F of x is going to be negative. Well, it's gonna be negative\\nif x is less than a. So this is if x is less than\\na or if x is between b and c then we see that f of\\nx is below the x-axis. F of x is down here so this\\nis where it's negative. So here or, or x is between\\nb or c, x is between b and c. And I'm not saying less than or equal to because at b or c the value of\\nthe function f of b is zero, f of c is zero. That's where we are actually\\nintersecting the x-axis. So that was reasonably straightforward. Now let's ask ourselves\\na different question. When is the function\\nincreasing or decreasing? So when is f of x, f of x increasing? Well increasing, one way to\\nthink about it is every time that x is increasing then\\ny should be increasing or another way to think\\nabout it, you have a, you have a positive rate of\\nchange of y with respect to x. We could even think about it as imagine if you had a tangent line\\nat any of these points. If you had a tangent line at\\nany of these points the slope of that tangent line is\\ngoing to be positive. But the easiest way for\\nme to think about it is as you increase x you're\\ngoing to be increasing y. So where is the function increasing? Well I'm doing it in blue. So it's increasing right until we get to this point right over\\nhere, right until we get to that point over there\\nthen it starts decreasing until we get to this\\npoint right over here and then it starts increasing again. It starts, it starts increasing again. So let me make some more labels here. So let's say that this,\\nthis is x equals d and that this right over here, actually let me do that in green color, so let's say this is x equals d. Now it's not a, d, b but you\\nget the picture and let's say that this is x is equal to, x is equal to, let me redo it a little\\nbit, x is equal to e. X is equal to e. So when is this function increasing? Well it's increasing if x is\\nless than d, x is less than d and I'm not gonna say\\nless than or equal to 'cause right at x equals\\nd it looks like just for that moment the\\nslope of the tangent line looks like it would be,\\nit would be constant. We're going from increasing to decreasing so right at d we're neither\\nincreasing or decreasing. But then we're also increasing,\\nso if x is less than d or x is greater than e,\\nor x is greater than e. And where is f of x decreasing? So f of x, let me do this\\nin a different color. When is, let me pick a\\nmauve, so f of x decreasing, decreasing well it's going\\nto be right over here. It's gonna be right between d and e. Between x equals d and x equals e but not exactly at those points 'cause at both of those points you're neither increasing nor decreasing but you see right over\\nhere as x increases, as you increase your x\\nwhat's happening to your y? If you go from this point\\nand you increase your x what happened to your y? Your y has decreased. You increase your x, your y has decreased, you increase your x, y has decreased, increase x, y has decreased all the way until this point over here. So f of x is decreasing\\nfor x between d and e. So hopefully that gives\\nyou a sense of things. Notice, these aren't the same intervals. That we are, the intervals\\nwhere we're positive or negative don't perfectly coincide with when we are increasing or decreasing. So it's very important to\\nthink about these separately even though they kinda sound the same. \"),\n",

The function is graphed below The following table contains true statements. Match each statement with the feature on the graph that most closely corresponds to it So once again this is capital t as a function of lowercase t's temperature as a function of time So we see at time equals 0 the temperature is negative 3 degrees Celsius. And then as we go to 8 hours later, the temperature is at Zero degrees Celsius and then it hits a, it hits at least a relative maximum point or at least from what we see it could even be a Global Maximum point but based on what we see, it's definitely a relative maximum point 14 hours into this measurement at time equals 14 and then the temperature starts to go down again. So let's see, so in other words it is t hours after midnight, so this is this is at midnight This is going to be at 8:00 a.m.. This is going to be at noon and this is going to be at 2:00 p.m. And so on and so forth, but anyway. The feature, Y-intercept. So the y-intercept is right over here And we see when lowercase t when time is zero, zero hours after midnight the temperature in New York City is Negative 3 degrees Celsius So it was negative 3 degrees Celsius, at the beginning of the day Yeah, that's a true statement and especially if you consider the beginning of the day, the true beginning of the day is right at midnight so That's that one. The y-intercept tells us this true statement So positive or negative interval and these questions are a little bit tricky because you don't have to use It's the positive or the negative interval It doesn't have to be both, so if either the positive or negative interval helps you with one of these other two statements So let's see. It was getting warmer between 2:00 a.m.. and 2:00 p.m.. The temperature was above zero between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m. So let's see. If we're talking about positive or negative intervals, so we're not talking about increasing or decreasing We're talking about positive or negative intervals, so we have a negative interval Sorry, we have a negative interval from time equals zero to time equals eight What do I mean by negative interval is the temperature is negative. It goes, it's below zero And then from, time, from eight hours from 8 a.m. To what is this this would be noon, this would be 8 p.m.. From 8 a.m.. to 8 p.m. Or the 20th hour if you're taking in military time, so to speak. We see that our temperature is positive and then it dips down to negative again. So a positive or negative interval tells us when our temperature was above or below zero. And we can see we have this positive interval where the temperature was above zero between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m. So we're only using the positive interval this interval right over here where the function is positive? That means that the temperature was above zero degrees Celsius between 8 a.m.. and 8 p.m. So once again we don't- It's saying either the positive or the negative interval helped us make the statement. In this case it was only the positive interval helped us make this statement, and then finally we have increasing or decreasing interval. And it was getting warmer between 2 a.m.. and 2 p.m.. It was getting warmer between 2 a.m. Which is right over here. So we see that the function is increasing as t increases so does the temperature, all the way to 2 p.m. And that, right of there, is an increasing interval. So once again we're not using an increasing and a decreasing interval, we're just using the increasing interval, the decreasing interval isn't helping us to make the statement, but the increasing interval is helping us. It's letting us make the statement. It was getting warmer between 2:00 a.m.. And 2:00 p.m. From here to here or between 2:00 a.m.. and 2:00 p.m. We see that the function itself is increasing that is an increasing Increasing interval and we got it, right \"),\n",

So the height must\\nbe y because that's the thing that is a\\nfunction of something else. So this right over\\nhere is height. So our y-axis is going\\nto represent height. And it is a function of x. So x must represent\\nhorizontal distance because height is a function\\nof horizontal distance. So this right over here\\nis horizontal distance. Now, it's plotted below. Mr Theisen is standing\\nat x equals 0. So he's standing\\nright over here. This is Mr. Theisen, as I\\ndraw my best attempt to draw a little stick figure\\nversion of Mr. Theisen. That's not even an acceptable\\nstick figure right over there. So this is Mr. Theisen, and\\nhe's standing at x equals 0. And at x equals 0, he is\\nshooting a basketball. And you see from the\\nfunction right over here that where the graph\\nintersects the y-axis, that tells us that's essentially\\nthe height of the ball when x is equal 0, where it's\\nwhere Mr. Theisen is standing. And if we look at\\nthis, this looks like it's 2, 4, 6 feet high. So that's really the\\ninitial position of the ball when Mr. Theisen is\\nabout to let go of it. Then he lets go of\\nit, and the ball goes in this\\nparabolic trajectory. It increases, increases,\\nincreasing, increases. It looks like it hits a maximum\\npoint right around there, roughly. That looks like it's\\nat about 16 feet. And then it starts to go down. And right over\\nhere-- and this looks like it's about,\\nlet's see, 22, 24, 26 feet out-- it looks\\nlike it hit something. And considering that\\nsomething is 10 feet high, it's reasonable to assume\\nthat the thing that it hits is the goal. And especially\\nbecause the question states that he has deadly\\nthree-point precision, we can assume it's not\\ncrazy that he actually makes the goal. And so that's where\\nit goes into the net. And then the net forces\\nthe ball to go down at a much steeper trajectory. And this is exactly, of\\ncourse, 10 feet high, the height of the goal. Now let's see which of\\nthese interpretations are consistent with\\nthe interpretation that we just did. The ball is released\\nfrom Mr. Theisen's hand at a height of 6 feet. Well, that looks exactly right. When x is equal to 0,\\nthe ball is 6 feet. And not only is\\nthat right, but that is the significance of the\\ny-intercept of this function. The y-intercept\\nis the value of y, the height when x is equal to 0. So that is indeed\\nthe significance of the y-intercept. Let's look at\\nthese other things. Mr. Theisen is shooting the\\nbasketball from 26 feet away. Well, that's right. He's at x equals 0. The goal is at 26 feet away. But that's not the significance\\nof the y-intercept. That would be the\\nsignificance of where we saw this little point here\\nwhere the ball dropped down at a steeper angle. The rim of the basketball\\nhoop is 10 feet high. Once again, that's true.

And so in this situation, if we're going from time\\nequal one to time equal two, our change in time,\\ndelta t is equal to one and what is our change in distance? We go from distance is\\nequal to four meters, at time equals one, to distance in seven\\nmeters at time equal two and so our change in distance\\nhere is equal to three and if we wanna put our units, it's three meters for\\nevery one second in time and so our slope would be\\nour change in our vertical divided by our change in our horizontal, which would be change in\\nd, delta d over delta t, which is equal to three over one or we could just write that\\nas three meters per second and you might recognize this as a rate, if you're thinking about\\nyour change in distance over change in time,\\nthis rate right over here is going to be your speed. This is all a review of\\nwhat you've seen before and what's interesting about a line, or if we're talking\\nabout a linear function, is that your rate does\\nnot change at any point, the slope of this line\\nbetween any two points is always going to be three, but what's interesting about\\nthis function on the right is that is not true, our rate of change is constantly changing and we're going to study\\nthat in a lot more depth, when we get to differential calculus and really this video's a little bit of a foundational primer\\nfor that future state, where we learn about differential calculus and the thing to appreciate here is think about the instantaneous\\nrate of change someplace, so let's say right over there, if you ever think about\\nthe slope of a line, that just barely touches this graph, it might look something like that, the slope of a tangent line and then right over here, it looks like it's a little bit steeper and then over here, it looks\\nlike it's a little bit steeper, so it looks like your rate of change is increasing as t increases. As I mentioned, we will build the tools to later think about\\ninstantaneous rate of change, but what we can start to think about is an average rate of change, average rate of change, and the way that we think about\\nour average rate of change is we use the same tools, that\\nwe first learned in algebra, we think about slopes of secant lines, what is a secant line? Well, we talk about this in geometry, that a secant is something\\nthat intersects a curve in two points, so let's\\nsay that there's a line, that intersects at t equals\\nzero and t equals one and so let me draw that\\nline, I'll draw it in orange, so this right over here is a secant line and you could do the\\nslope of the secant line as the average rate of change from t equals zero to t equals one, well, what is that average\\nrate of change going to be? Well, the slope of our\\nsecant line is going to be our change in distance\\ndivided by our change in time, which is going to be equal to, well, our change in time is one second, one, I'll put the units here, one second and what is our change in distance? At t equals zero or d of zero is one and d of one is two, so our distance has\\nincreased by one meter, so we've gone one meter in one second or we could say that our\\naverage rate of change over that first second from t equals zero, t equals one is one meter per second, but let's think about what it is, if we're going from t equals two to t equals three. Well, once again, we can\\nlook at this secant line and we can figure out its slope, so the slope here,\\nwhich you could also use the average rate of change from t equals two to t equals three, as I already mentioned, the rate of change seems\\nto be constantly changing, but we can think about\\nthe average rate of change and so that's going to\\nbe our change in distance over our change in time, which is going to be equal\\nto when t is equal to two, our distance is equal to five, so one, two, three, four, five, so that's five right over there and when t is equal to three,\\nour distance is equal to 10, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,\\nso that is 10 right over there, so our change in time, that's\\npretty straightforward, we've just gone forward one\\nsecond, so that's one second and then our change in\\ndistance right over here, we go from five meters to\\n10 meters is five meters, so this is equal to five meters per second and so this makes it very clear, that our average rate\\nof change has changed from t equals zero, t equals one to t equals two to t equals three, our average rate of change is higher on this second interval,\\nthan on this first one and as you can imagine, something very interesting to think about is what if you were to take the slope of the secant line of\\ncloser and closer points? Well, then you would get closer and closer to approximating that\\nslope of the tangent line and that's actually what we\\nwill do when we get to calculus. \"),\n",

It's a very negative slope,\\nit gets less negative. Less negative slope is 0 here. Then it gets positive, more\\npositive, and more positive, and more positive.

So another way of asking\\nover which interval does y of x have an average\\nrate of change of negative 4 is, can you come\\nup with an interval where the slope between the\\nendpoints of the interval is negative 4?

Because the slope of\\nthis line, the line that connects the endpoints\\nof my interval, that is going to be the\\naverage rate of change over this interval.

Move one ahead in\\nthe x direction, we move down four\\nin the y direction. So the average rate of\\nchange over this interval is negative 4.

This triangle, that's the Greek letter Delta, represents change in. So change in temperature over change in time. So let's think about what this rate of temperature change is, between these different intervals. So between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.. So let me really see Change in temperature over change in time So what was our change in temperature? Our temperature went up, by 6 degrees Celsius. Let me just write it here 6 degrees Celsius. And what is our change in time? Our time went up by 3 hours, plus 3 hours. So you're going to have a change of 6 degrees Celsius, positive change of 6 degrees Celsius over a positive change, we've Gone 3 hours into the future, Over 3 hours we increased our temperature by 6 degrees or you could say it's an average rate of change of 6 divided by 3 is 2 degrees Celsius, per hour. Notice, I'm just keeping the unit's the same degrees Celsius per hour, so that's the rate of change between 6 a.m. And 9:00 a.m. Now let's ask ourselves the same question between 9:00 a.m.. and 1:00 p.m.. So our change in temperature over change in time What is our change in temperature? Well our temperature goes up from 25 to 31 degrees Celsius. That's another 6 degrees Celsius. But it's no longer 3 hours to go from 9 hours after minute to 13 hours after midnight We're now doing it over 4 hours. So Plus 4 hours.

It took it four hours to increase 6 degrees Celsius well over here it took it only 3 hours. So immediately you might recognize that this is going to be faster. If you increase 6 degrees Celsius over 3 hours that's faster than increasing 6 degrees Celsius Over 4 hours. But just to make the comparison a little bit clearer Let's actually just do the math here. 6 divided by 4 well that's going to be 1.5 1.5 degrees Celsius per hour. Here you can make the direct comparison. 2 degrees Celsius per hour is faster than 1.5 degrees Celsius per hour. So that's why we liked this choice up here \"),\n",

And her height is decreasing at faster and faster rates as we move to the right so her- her- the rate of decline of her height is quite steep as we approach ten seconds after she jumps And then we can see all of a sudden, then we can see all of a sudden her rate of decline slows down She's still declining as -as we move forward in time, but she's declining at a slower rate. And so we can say she's declining at a --- or she is --- her height is changing at a less negative rate It's -It's quite a negative rate right over here --- seems roughly a fairly negative rate but then it becomes a less negative rate right over here her height is changing at a less negative rate and it makes sense that this is when she deploys the parachute, so after 10 seconds she deploys the parachute so she jumps at 0 seconds, 10 seconds she deploys the parachute. Alright so let's see what they're asking --- actually asking us.

       "  \"Let's think about what\\nfunctions really do, and then we'll think about the idea of\\nan inverse of a function. So let's start with a pretty\\nstraightforward function. Let's say f of x is\\nequal to 2x plus 4. And so if I take f of 2, f of 2\\nis going to be equal to 2 times 2 plus 4, which is 4\\nplus 4, which is 8. I could take f of 3, which\\nis 2 times 3 plus 4, which is equal to 10. 6 plus 4. So let's think about it\\nin a little bit more of an abstract sense. So there's a set of things that\\nI can input into this function. You might already be\\nfamiliar with that notion. It's the domain. The set of all of the things\\nthat I can input into that function, that is the domain. And in that domain, 2 is\\nsitting there, you have 3 over there, pretty much you could\\ninput any real number into this function. So this is going to be all\\nreal, but we're making it a nice contained set here just\\nto help you visualize it. Now, when you apply the\\nfunction, let's think about it means to take f of 2. We're inputting a number, 2,\\nand then the function is outputting the number 8. It is mapping us from 2 to 8. So let's make another set here\\nof all of the possible values that my function can take on. And we can call that the range. There are more formal ways to\\ntalk about this, and there's a much more rigorous discussion\\nof this later on, especially in the linear algebra playlist,\\nbut this is all the different values I can take on. So if I take the number 2 from\\nour domain, I input it into the function, we're getting\\nmapped to the number 8. So let's let me draw that out. So we're going from 2 to\\nthe number 8 right there. And it's being done\\nby the function. The function is\\ndoing that mapping. That function is mapping\\nus from 2 to 8. This right here, that\\nis equal to f of 2. Same idea. You start with 3, 3 is being\\nmapped by the function to 10. It's creating an association. The function is mapping\\nus from 3 to 10. Now, this raises an\\ninteresting question. Is there a way to get back from\\n8 to the 2, or is there a way to go back from\\nthe 10 to the 3? Or is there some\\nother function? Is there some other function,\\nwe can call that the inverse of f, that'll take us back? Is there some other\\nfunction that'll take us from 10 back to 3? We'll call that the inverse\\nof f, and we'll use that as notation, and it'll take\\nus back from 10 to 3. Is there a way to do that? Will that same inverse of f,\\nwill it take us back from-- if we apply 8 to it-- will\\nthat take us back to 2? Now, all this seems very\\nabstract and difficult. What you'll find is it's\\nactually very easy to solve for this inverse of f, and I think\\nonce we solve for it, it'll make it clear what\\nI'm talking about. That the function takes you\\nfrom 2 to 8, the inverse will take us back from 8 to 2. So to think about that, let's\\njust define-- let's just say y is equal to f of x. So y is equal to f of x,\\nis equal to 2x plus 4. So I can write just y is equal\\nto 2x plus 4, and this once again, this is our function. You give me an x,\\nit'll give me a y. But we want to go the\\nother way around. We want to give you\\na y and get an x. So all we have to do is\\nsolve for x in terms of y. So let's do that. If we subtract 4 from both\\nsides of this equation-- let me switch colors-- if we subtract\\n4 from both sides of this equation, we get y minus 4 is\\nequal to 2x, and then if we divide both sides of this\\nequation by 2, we get y over 2 minus 2-- 4 divided by 2\\nis 2-- is equal to x. Or if we just want to write it\\nthat way, we can just swap the sides, we get x is equal to\\n1/2y-- same thing as y over 2-- minus 2. So what we have here is\\na function of y that gives us an x, which is\\nexactly what we wanted. We want a function of these\\nvalues that map back to an x. So we can call this-- we could\\nsay that this is equal to-- I'll do it in the same color--\\nthis is equal to f inverse as a function of y. Or let me just write it\\na little bit cleaner. We could say f inverse as a\\nfunction of y-- so we can have 10 or 8-- so now the range is\\nnow the domain for f inverse. f inverse as a function of y\\nis equal to 1/2y minus 2. So all we did is we started\\nwith our original function, y is equal to 2x plus 4, we\\nsolved for-- over here, we've solved for y in terms of x--\\nthen we just do a little bit of algebra, solve for x in terms\\nof y, and we say that that is our inverse as a function of y. Which is right over here. And then, if we, you know, you\\ncan say this is-- you could replace the y with an a, a b,\\nan x, whatever you want to do, so then we can just\\nrename the y as x. So if you put an x into this\\nfunction, you would get f inverse of x is equal\\nto 1/2x minus 2. So all you do, you solve for x,\\nand then you swap the y and the x, if you want to\\ndo it that way. That's the easiest way\\nto think about it. And one thing I want to point\\nout is what happens when you graph the function\\nand the inverse. So let me just do a\\nlittle quick and dirty graph right here. And then I'll do a bunch of\\nexamples of actually solving for inverses, but I really\\njust wanted to give you the general idea. Function takes you from the\\ndomain to the range, the inverse will take you from that\\npoint back to the original value, if it exists. So if I were to graph these--\\njust let me draw a little coordinate axis right here,\\ndraw a little bit of a coordinate axis right there. This first function, 2x plus 4,\\nits y intercept is going to be 1, 2, 3, 4, just like that, and\\nthen its slope will look like this. It has a slope of 2, so it will\\nlook something like-- its graph will look-- let me make it a\\nlittle bit neater than that-- it'll look something like that. That's what that\\nfunction looks like. What does this\\nfunction look like? What does the inverse function\\nlook like, as a function of x? Remember we solved for x,\\nand then we swapped the x and the y, essentially. We could say now that y is\\nequal to f inverse of x. So we have a y-intercept\\nof negative 2, 1, 2, and now the slope is 1/2. The slope looks like this. Let me see if I can draw it. The slope looks-- or the line\\nlooks something like that. And what's the\\nrelationship here? I mean, you know, these look\\nkind of related, it looks like they're reflected\\nabout something. It'll be a little bit more\\nclear what they're reflected about if we draw the\\nline y is equal to x. So the line y equals\\nx looks like that. I'll do it as a dotted line. And you could see, you have\\nthe function and its inverse, they're reflected about\\nthe line y is equal to x. And hopefully, that\\nmakes sense here. Because over here, on\\nthis line, let's take an easy example. Our function, when you take\\n0-- so f of 0 is equal to 4. Our function is mapping 0 to 4. The inverse function, if\\nyou take f inverse of 4, f inverse of 4 is equal to 0. Or the inverse function is\\nmapping us from 4 to 0. Which is exactly\\nwhat we expected. The function takes us from the\\nx to the y world, and then we swap it, we were swapping\\nthe x and the y. We would take the inverse. And that's why it's reflected\\naround y equals x. So this example that I just\\nshowed you right here, function takes you from 0 to 4-- maybe I\\nshould do that in the function color-- so the function takes\\nyou from 0 to 4, that's the function f of 0 is 4, you see\\nthat right there, so it goes from 0 to 4, and then\\nthe inverse takes us back from 4 to 0. So f inverse takes us\\nback from 4 to 0. You saw that right there. When you evaluate 4 here,\\n1/2 times 4 minus 2 is 0. The next couple of videos we'll\\ndo a bunch of examples so you really understand how to solve\\nthese and are able to do the exercises on our\\napplication for this. \"),\n",

You might already have experience\\nwith doing composite functions, where you say, f of f of -9 plus 1.

Notice, instead of mapping\\nfrom this thing to that thing, we\\'re now going to map\\nfrom that thing to this thing. So f inverse is going to map\\nfrom 13 to 5. It\\'s going to map from -7 to 6. It\\'s going to map from 8 to 9, and it\\'s going to map from 12 to 11. Looks like I got all of them, yep. So all I did was swap these columns. The f inverse maps from this column\\nto that column. So I just swapped them out.\\nNow it becomes a little clearer. You see it right here, f inverse of 8,\\nif you input 8 into f inverse, you get 9. Now we can use that\\nto start doing fancier things. We can evaluate something like\\nf of f inverse of 7. f of f inverse of 7. What is this going to be? Let\\'s first evaluate f inverse of 7. f inverse of 7 maps from 7 to -7. So this is going to be f\\nof this stuff in here, f inverse of 7, you see,\\nis -7. And then to evaluate the function,\\nf of -7 is going to be 7. And that makes complete sense. We mapped from f inverse of 7\\nto -7 and evaluating the function of that,\\nwent back to 7. So let\\'s do one more of these\\njust to really feel comfortable with mapping back-and-forth\\nbetween these two sets, between applying the function\\nand the inverse of the function. Let\\'s evaluate f inverse\\nof f inverse of 13. f inverse of 13. What is that going to be? I encourage you to pause the video\\nand try to figure it out. What\\'s f inverse of 13? That\\'s, looking at this table right here,\\nf inverse goes from 13 to 5. You see it over here, f went from 5 to 13,\\nso f inverse is going to go from 13 to 5. So, f inverse of 13 is going to be 5, so this is the same thing\\nas f inverse of 5. And f inverse of 5? -9.\\nSo this is going to be equal to -9. Once again, f inverse goes\\nfrom 5 to -9. So at first when you start doing\\nthese functions and inverse of functions it looks a little confusing,\\nhey, I\\'m going back and forth, but you just have to remember a function maps from one set of numbers\\nto another set of numbers. The inverse of that function\\ngoes the other way. If the function goes from 9 to 8,\\nthe inverse is going to go from 8 to 9. So one way to think about it is,\\nyou just switch these columns. Hopefully, that clarifies\\nmore things than it confuses. '),\n",

It's an interactive one\\nwhere we can move this line around and it tells us 'the graph of h(x)\\nis the green', so that's this dotted green line,\\n'the dashed line segment shown below'. So that's this. 'Drag the endpoints of the segment below\\nto graph h inverse of (x). There's a couple of ways to tackle it. Perhaps the simplest one\\nis we say, okay, look, h(x), what does h(x)\\nmap from and to? So h(x), this point\\nshows that h(x), if you input -8 into h of (x),\\nh of -8 is 1, so it's mapping from -8 to 1. Well, the inverse of that, then,\\nshould map from 1 to -8. So let's put that point on the graph,\\nand let's go on the other end. On the other end of h of x, we see that when you input 3 into h of x,\\nwhen x is equal to 3, h of x is equal to -4. So this point shows us\\nthat it's mapping from 3 to -4. So the inverse of that would map\\nfrom -4 to 3. If you input -4 it should output 3. Since we took\\nthe two end points of this line and found the inverse mapping of it, what I have just done here\\nis that I have graphed the inverse. Another way to think about the inverse is if you were to draw the line y = x, these things should be reflections\\naround the line y =x because one way to think about it is,\\nyou're swapping the xs for the ys. If you were to draw the line y = x, if you flipped it around,\\nthe line y = x, the green line, you would actually get the old line. This would flip over there\\nand this would flip over there.

       "  \"So we have f of x is equal to\\nnegative x plus 4, and f of x is graphed right here on\\nour coordinate plane. Let's try to figure out\\nwhat the inverse of f is. And to figure out the inverse,\\nwhat I like to do is I set y, I set the variable y, equal to f\\nof x, or we could write that y is equal to negative x plus 4. Right now, we've solved\\nfor y in terms of x. To solve for the inverse,\\nwe do the opposite. We solve for x in terms of y. So let's subtract 4\\nfrom both sides. You get y minus 4 is\\nequal to negative x. And then to solve for x, we can\\nmultiply both sides of this equation times negative 1. And so you get negative\\ny plus 4 is equal to x. Or just because we're always\\nused to writing the dependent variable on the left-hand side,\\nwe could rewrite this as x is equal to negative y plus 4. Or another way to write it\\nis we could say that f inverse of y is equal\\nto negative y plus 4. So this is the inverse function\\nright here, and we've written it as a function of y, but we\\ncan just rename the y as x so it's a function of x. So let's do that. So if we just rename this y as\\nx, we get f inverse of x is equal to the negative x plus 4. These two functions\\nare identical. Here, we just used y as the\\nindependent variable, or as the input variable. Here we just use x, but they\\nare identical functions. Now, just out of interest,\\nlet's graph the inverse function and see how it\\nmight relate to this one right over here. So if you look at it,\\nit actually looks fairly identical. It's a negative x plus 4. It's the exact same function. So let's see, if we have-- the\\ny-intercept is 4, it's going to be the exact same thing. The function is\\nits own inverse. So if we were to graph it,\\nwe would put it right on top of this. And so, there's a couple of\\nways to think about it. In the first inverse function\\nvideo, I talked about how a function and their inverse--\\nthey are the reflection over the line y equals x. So where's the line\\ny equals x here? Well, line y equals\\nx looks like this. And negative x plus 4 is\\nactually perpendicular to y is equal to x, so when you reflect\\nit, you're just kind of flipping it over, but it's\\ngoing to be the same line. It is its own reflection. Now, let's make sure that\\nthat actually makes sense. When we're dealing with the\\nstandard function right there, if you input a 2,\\nit gets mapped to a 2. If you input a 4, it\\ngets mapped to 0. What happens if you\\ngo the other way? If you input a 2, well, 2\\ngets mapped to 2 either way, so that makes sense. For the regular function,\\n4 gets mapped to 0. For the inverse function,\\n0 gets mapped to 4. So it actually makes\\ncomplete sense. Let's think about\\nit another way. For the regular function-- let\\nme write it explicitly down. This might be obvious to\\nyou, but just in case it's not, it might be helpful. Let's pick f of 5. f of 5 is equal to negative 1. Or we could say, the function f\\nmaps us from 5 to negative 1. Now, what does f inverse do? What's f inverse of negative 1? f inverse of negative 1 is 5. Or we could say that f maps\\nus from negative 1 to 5. So once again, if you think\\nabout kind of the sets, they're our domains and our ranges. So let's say that this is\\nthe domain of f, this is the range of f. f will take us from\\nto negative 1. That's what the\\nfunction f does. And we see that f inverse takes\\nus back from negative 1 to 5. f inverse takes us back\\nfrom negative 1 to 5, just like it's supposed to do. Let's do one more of these. So here I have g of x is equal\\nto negative 2x minus 1. So just like the last problem,\\nI like to set y equal to this. So we say y is equal to g\\nof x, which is equal to negative 2x minus 1. Now we just solve for x. y plus 1 is equal\\nto negative 2x. Just added 1 to both sides. Now we can divide both sides of\\nthis equation by negative 2, and so you get negative y over\\n2 minus 1/2 is equal to x, or we could write x is equal to\\nnegative y over 2 minus 1/2, or we could write f inverse as a\\nfunction of y is equal to negative y over 2 minus 1/2, or\\nwe can just rename y as x. And we could say that f inverse\\nof-- oh, let me careful here. That shouldn't be an f. The original function was\\ng , so let me be clear. That is g inverse of y is equal\\nto negative y over 2 minus 1/2 because we started with a\\ng of x, not an f of x. Make sure we get our\\nnotation right. Or we could just rename the y\\nand say g inverse of x is equal to negative x over 2 minus 1/2. Now, let's graph it. Its y-intercept\\nis negative 1/2. It's right over there. And it has a slope\\nof negative 1/2. Let's see, if we start at\\nnegative 1/2, if we move over to 1 in the positive direction,\\nit will go down half. If we move over 1 again, it\\nwill go down half again. If we move back-- so\\nit'll go like that. So the line, I'll try my\\nbest to draw it, will look something like that. It'll just keep going, so it'll\\nlook something like that, and it'll keep going in\\nboth directions. And now let's see if this\\nreally is a reflection over y equals x. y equals x looks\\nlike that, and you can see they are a reflection. If you reflect this guy, if you\\nreflect this blue line, it becomes this orange line. But the general idea, you\\nliterally just-- a function is originally expressed, is\\nsolved for y in terms of x. You just do some algebra. Solve for x in terms of y, and\\nthat's essentially your inverse function as a function of y,\\nbut then you can rename it as a function of x. \"),\n",

       "  \"What I want to do in this\\nvideo is familiarize ourselves with the notion of a sequence. And all a sequence is is\\nan ordered list of numbers. So for example, I could\\nhave a finite sequence-- that means I don't have an\\ninfinite number of numbers in it-- where, let's say, I\\nstart at 1 and I keep adding 3. So 1 plus 3 is 4. 4 plus 3 is 7. 7 plus 3 is 10. And let's say I only have these\\nfour terms right over here. So this one we would\\ncall a finite sequence. I could also have an\\ninfinite sequence. So an example of an\\ninfinite sequence-- let's say we start at\\n3, and we keep adding 4. So we go to 3, to 7, to 11, 15. And you don't always have\\nto add the same thing. We'll explore fancier sequences. The sequences where you\\nkeep adding the same amount, we call these\\narithmetic sequences, which we will also\\nexplore in more detail. But to show that\\nthis is infinite, to show that we keep this\\npattern going on and on and on, I'll put three dots. This just means we're going to\\nkeep going on and on and on. So we could call this\\nan infinite sequence. Now, there's a bunch\\nof different notations that seem fancy for\\ndenoting sequences. But this is all they refer to. But I want to make us\\ncomfortable with how we can denote sequences and\\nalso how we can define them. We could say that\\nthis right over here is the sequence a sub k\\nfor k is going from 1 to 4, is equal to this\\nright over here. So when we look\\nat it this way, we can look at each of these as\\nthe terms in the sequence. And this right over here\\nwould be the first term. We would call that a sub 1. This right over here\\nwould be the second term. We'd call it a sub 2. I think you get the\\npicture-- a sub 3. This right over here is a sub 4. So this just says, all of the\\na sub k's from k equals 1, from our first term, all\\nthe way to the fourth term. Now, I could also define it\\nby not explicitly writing the sequence like this. I could essentially do\\nit defining our sequence as explicitly using kind of a\\nfunction notation or something close to function notation. So the same exact\\nsequence, I could define it as a sub k from k equals 1 to\\n4, with-- instead of explicitly writing the numbers\\nhere, I could say a sub k is equal to some function of k. So let's see what happens. When k is 1, we get 1. When k is 2, we get 4. When k is 3, we get 7. So let's see. When k is 3, we added 3 twice. Let me make it clear. So this was a plus 3. This right over\\nhere was a plus 3. This right over\\nhere is a plus 3. So whatever k is,\\nwe started at 1. And we added 3 one less\\nthan the k term times. So we could say that this\\nis going to be equal to 1 plus k minus 1\\ntimes 3, or maybe I should write 3 times k\\nminus 1-- same thing. And you can verify\\nthat this works. If k is equal to 1, you're\\ngoing to get 1 minus 1 is 0. And so a sub 1 is going to be 1. If k is equal to 2, you're going\\nto have 1 plus 3, which is 4. If k is equal to 3, you\\nget 3 times 2 plus 1 is 7. So it works out. So this is one way to explicitly\\ndefine our sequence with kind of this function notation. I want to make it clear--\\nI have essentially defined a function here. If I wanted a more\\ntraditional function notation, I could have written\\na of k, where k is the term that\\nI care about. a of k is equal to 1\\nplus 3 times k minus 1. This is essentially\\na function, where an allowable input,\\nthe domain, is restricted to positive integers. Now, how would I denote this\\nbusiness right over here? Well, I could say that\\nthis is equal to-- and people tend to use a. But I could use the notation\\nb sub k or anything else. But I'll do a again-- a sub k. And here, we're going\\nfrom our first term-- so this is a sub 1,\\nthis is a sub 2-- all the way to infinity. Or we could define it-- if we\\nwanted to define it explicitly as a function-- we could write\\nthis sequence as a sub k, where k starts at the first\\nterm and goes to infinity, with a sub k is equaling--\\nso we're starting at 3. And we are adding\\n4 one less time. For the second term,\\nwe added 4 once. For the third term,\\nwe add 4 twice. For the fourth term,\\nwe add 4 three times. So we're adding 4 one less\\nthan the term that we're at. So it's going to be\\nplus 4 times k minus 1. So this is another\\nway of defining this infinite sequence. Now, in both of these\\ncases, I defined it as an explicit function. So this right over\\nhere is explicit. That's not an attractive color. Let me write this in. This is an explicit function. And so you might\\nsay, well, what's another way of defining\\nthese functions? Well, we can also define\\nit, especially something like an arithmetic sequence, we\\ncan also define it recursively. And I want to be clear-- not\\nevery sequence can be defined as either an explicit\\nfunction like this, or as a recursive function. But many can,\\nincluding this, which is an arithmetic\\nsequence, where we keep adding the same\\nquantity over and over again. So how would we do that? Well, we could also--\\nanother way of defining this first sequence,\\nwe could say a sub k, starting at k equals\\n1 and going to 4 with. And when you define a\\nsequence recursively, you want to define what your\\nfirst term is, with a sub 1 equaling 1. You can define every other term\\nin terms of the term before it. And so then we\\ncould write a sub k is equal to the previous term. So this is a sub k minus 1. So a given term is equal\\nto the previous term. Let me make it clear-- this is\\nthe previous term, plus-- in this case, we're\\nadding 3 every time. Now, how does this make sense? Well, we're defining\\nwhat a sub 1 is. And if someone says, well,\\nwhat happens when k equals 2? Well, they're saying, well, it's\\ngoing to be a sub 2 minus 1. So it's going to\\nbe a sub 1 plus 3. Well, we know a sub 1 is 1. So it's going to be\\n1 plus 3, which is 4. Well, what about a sub 3? Well, it's going to be\\na sub 2 plus 3. a sub 2, we just calculated as 4. You add 3. It's going to be 7. This is essentially\\nwhat we mentally did when I first wrote out the\\nsequence, when I said, hey, I'm just going to start with 1. And I'm just going to add 3\\nfor every successive term. So how would we do this one? Well, once again, we could\\nwrite this as a sub k. Starting at k, the\\nfirst term, going to infinity with-- our\\nfirst term, a sub 1, is going to be 3, now. And every successive\\nterm, a sub k, is going to be the previous\\nterm, a sub k minus 1, plus 4. And once again, you start at 3. And then if you want\\nthe second term, it's going to be the\\nfirst term plus 4. It's going to be 3 plus 4. You get to 7. And you keep adding 4. So both of these,\\nthis right over here is a recursive definition. We started with\\nkind of a base case. And then every term is\\ndefined in terms of the term before it or in terms\\nof the function itself, but the function for\\na different term. \"),\n",

       "  \"What I want to do in this\\nvideo is familiarize ourselves with a very common\\nclass of sequences. And this is\\narithmetic sequences. And they are usually\\npretty easy to spot. They are sequences where each\\nterm is a fixed number larger than the term before it. So my goal here is to figure\\nout which of these sequences are arithmetic sequences. And then just so that\\nwe have some practice with some of the\\nsequence notation, I want to define them\\neither as explicit functions of the term you're looking for,\\nthe index you're looking at, or as recursive definitions. So first, given that\\nan arithmetic sequence is one where each successive\\nterm is a fixed amount larger than the previous one, which of\\nthese are arithmetic sequences? Well let's look at this\\nfirst one right over here. To go from negative 5 to\\nnegative 3, we had to add 2. Then to go from negative 3 to\\nnegative 1, you have to add 2. Then to go from negative\\n1 to 1, you had to add 2. So this is clearly an\\narithmetic sequence. We're adding the same\\namount every time. And there are several ways that\\nwe could define the sequence. We could say it's a sub n. And you don't always\\nhave to use k. This time I'll use n\\nto denote our index. From n equals 1 to infinity\\nwith-- and there's two ways we could define it. We could either\\ndefine it explicitly, or we could define\\nit recursively. So if we wanted to\\ndefine it explicitly, we could write a sub n is equal\\nto whatever the first term is. In this case, our first\\nterm is negative 5. It's equal to negative\\n5 plus-- we're going to add 2 one less\\ntimes than the term we're at. So for the second\\nterm, we add 2 once. For the third term,\\nwe add 2 twice. For the fourth term,\\nfrom our base term, we added 2 three times. So we're going to add 2. We're going to add positive\\n2 one less than the index that we're looking\\nat-- n minus 1 times. So this is an\\nexplicit definition of this arithmetic sequence. If I wanted to write\\nit recursively, I could say a sub 1 is\\nequal to negative 5. And then each successive term,\\nfor a sub 2 and greater-- so I could say a sub n is equal\\nto a sub n minus 1 plus 3. Each term is equal to the\\nprevious term-- oh, not 3-- plus 2. So this is for n is\\ngreater than or equal to 2. So either of these\\nare completely legitimate ways of defining\\nthe arithmetic sequence that we have here. We can either define\\nit explicitly, or we could define\\nit recursively. Now let's look at this sequence. Is this one arithmetic? Well, we're going from 100. We add 7. 107 to 114, we're adding 7. 114 to 121, we are adding 7. So this is indeed an\\narithmetic sequence. So just to be\\nclear, this is one, and this is one right over here. And we could write that this\\nis the sequence a sub n, n going from 1 to infinity\\nof-- and we could just say a sub n, if we want\\nto define it explicitly, is equal to 100 plus\\nwe're adding 7 every time. And then each term-- the\\nsecond term we added 7 once. Third term-- we add 7 twice. So for the nth term, we're\\ngoing to add 7 n minus 1 times. So this is an explicit\\ndefinition of it, but we could also\\ndo it recursively. So just to be clear, this is\\none definition where we write it like this, or we\\ncould write a sub n, from n equals 1 to infinity. And in either case\\nI should write with. And if I want to\\ndefine it recursively, I could say a sub\\n1 is equal to 100. And then, for anything larger\\nthan 1, for any index above 1, a sub n is equal to the\\nprevious term plus 7. And so we're done. This is another\\nway of defining it. So in general, if you\\nwanted a generalizable way to spot or define an\\narithmetic sequence, you could say an\\narithmetic sequence is going to be of the form\\na sub n-- if we're talking about an infinite one--\\nfrom n equals 1 to infinity. If you want to\\ndefine it explicitly, you could say a sub n is\\nequal to some constant, which would essentially\\nthe first term. It would be some\\nconstant plus some number that your incrementing--\\nor I guess this could be a negative\\nnumber, or decrementing by-- times n minus 1. So this is one way to define\\nan arithmetic sequence. In this case, d was 2. In this case, d is 7. That's how much you're\\nadding by each time. And in this case, k is negative\\n5, and in this case, k is 100. The other way, if you\\nwanted to the right the recursive way of defining an\\narithmetic sequence generally, you could say a sub\\n1 is equal to k, and then a sub n is\\nequal to a sub n minus 1. A given term is equal\\nto the previous term plus d for n greater\\nthan or equal to 2. So once again, this is explicit. This is the recursive\\nway of defining it. And we would just\\nwrite with there. Now the last question I have\\nis is this one right over here an arithmetic sequence? Well, let's check it out. We start at 1. Then we add 2. Then we add 3. So this is an immediate\\ngiveaway that this is not an arithmetic sequence. Now we are adding 4. We're adding a different\\namount every time. So this, first of all,\\nthis is not arithmetic. This is not an\\narithmetic sequence. But how could we define\\nthis, since we're trying to define our sequences? Let's say we wanted to\\ndefine it recursively. So we could say, this is\\nequal to a sub n, where n is starting at 1 and\\nit's going to infinity, with-- we'll say our base\\ncase-- a sub 1 is equal to 1. And then for n is 2\\nor greater, a sub n is going to be equal to what? So a sub 2 is the previous\\nterm plus 2. a sub 3 is the previous\\nterm plus 3. a sub 4 is the previous term plus 4. So it's going to be the\\nprevious term plus whatever your index is. So this looks close,\\nbut notice here we're changing the amount\\nthat we're adding based on what our index is. We're adding the amount of\\nindex to the previous term. And so this is for n is\\ngreater than or equal to 2. Well for an arithmetic\\nsequence, we're adding the same\\namount regardless of what our index is. Here we're adding\\nthe index itself. So this one is not\\narithmetic, but it's an interesting\\nsequence nonetheless. \"),\n",

What is a-sub-20? And so a-sub-20 is the\\n20th term in the sequence and I encourage you to pause the video and figure out what is the 20th term? Well, we can just think\\nabout it like this. A-sub-20, we just use this\\ndefinition of the ith term. Everywhere we see an i,\\nwe would put a 20 in, so it's going to be 4 plus 3 times 20 minus 1, so once again, just to be clear, a-sub-20, where instead of a-sub-i,\\nwherever we saw an i, we put a 20, and now we can just compute\\nwhat this is going to be equal to. This is going to be equal to 4 plus 3 times 20 minus 1 is 19. 3 times 19, let's see, 3 times 19 is 57, right? It's 30 plus 27, yep. This is 57, and 4 plus 57 is equal to 61, so the 20th term in\\nthis arithmetic sequence is going to be 61. Let's do another one of these. And here, they've told us\\nthe arithmetic sequence a-sub-i is defined by the formula a-sub-1, they gave us the first term, and they say, every other term, so a-sub-i, they're defining\\nit in terms of the previous terms, so a-sub-i is going\\nto be a-sub-i minus 1 minus 2, so this is actually a\\nrecursive definition of our arithmetic sequence. Let's see what we can make of this, so a-sub-5, a-sub-5 is going to be equal to, we'll use this second line right here, a-sub-5 is going to be equal to a-sub-4 minus 2. Well, we don't know what\\na-sub-4 is just yet, so let's try to figure that out. So we could say that a-sub-4 is equal to, well if we use the second line again, it's going to be a-sub-3, minus 2. We still don't know what a-sub-3 is. I'll keep switching colors\\n'cause it looks nice. A-sub-3 is going to be equal to a-sub-3 minus 1, so a-sub-2 minus 2. We still don't know what a-sub-2 is, and so, we could write, a-sub-2 is equal to a-sub-2 minus 1, so that's a-sub-1 minus 2. Now, luckily we know what a-sub-1 is. A-sub-1 is negative 7. A-sub-1 is negative 7, so if this is negative 7, then a-sub-2 is negative 7 minus 2, which is equal to negative 9. Well that starts helping us out because if a-sub-2 is negative 9, if this is negative 9, then a-sub-3 is negative 9 minus 2, which is equal to negative 11. Well now that we know that\\na-sub-3 is negative 11, so this is negative 11, we could figure out a-sub-4 is negative 11 minus 2, which is equal to negative 13. And we're almost there. We know a-sub-4, the fourth term in this\\narithmetic sequence is negative 13, so, we can now, so if this is negative 13, a-sub-5 is going to be a-sub-4, which is negative 13 minus 2, which is equal to negative 15, so the fifth term in the sequence is negative 15. And we're all done. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We are\\ntold b of one is equal to negative seven, and b of n is equal to b of n minus one plus\\n12, and they're asking us to find the fourth term in the sequence. So what we have up here, which you could use a function definition, it's really defining\\nthe terms of a sequence. Especially if are to input\\nwhole numbers in here, it's the index on your sequence. What we really wanna do\\nis, we wanna figure out what is b of four going to be equal to? Well if we just blindly apply this, we would say all right b of four, so be of n, is equal to\\nb of n minus one plus 12, so it's gonna be b of\\nfour minus one plus 12. Well four minus one is just three, so it's going to be equal\\nto b of three plus 12. All I did is said okay, well\\nwe're not trying to figure out, or we're not immediately\\ntrying to figure out what b of one is. We're trying to figure\\nout what b of four is, so n is equal to four, so b\\nof four is going to be equal to b of four minus one,\\nor b of three, plus 12. To evaluate this, we have to\\nfigure out what b of three is, so let's write that down. That's what's fun about\\na recursive definition. You have to keep recursing\\nbackwards, so b of three. Well if n is three, that's\\ngoing to be equal to b of, now n minus one is two, b of two plus 12. We don't know what b of two\\nis, so let's keep going. We need to figure out b of two. If we use the same definition,\\nb of two is going to be equal to b of two minus one plus\\n12, so b of two minus one. That's b of one plus 12, but\\nwe don't know what b of one is, so let's figure that out. B of one is equal to, well\\nhere we can finally use this top clause, so b of one\\nis equal to negative seven. Now we can go and fill everything back in. If b of one is equal to negative\\nseven, then we know that this right over here is negative seven, and now we can figure out\\nthat b of two is equal to negative seven plus 12\\nwhich is equal to five. If b of two is equal to\\nfive, well then this is equal to five right over here,\\nand then now we know that b of three is equal to five plus 12 which is equal to 17. If we know that b of three is equal to 17, then we're ready to calculate\\nwhat b of four is going to be. B of four is now, it's b of three, which we figured out was 17 plus 12 which is equal to 29, and we are done. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] g is a function that describes an arithmetic sequence. Here are the first few\\nterms of the sequence. So let's say the first term is four, second term is 3 4/5, third term is 3 3/5, fourth term is 3 2/5. Find the values of the\\nmissing parameters A and B in the following recursive\\ndefinition of the sequence. So they say the nth term is going to be equal to A if n is equal to one and it's going to be\\nequal to g of n minus one plus B if n is greater than one. And so I encourage you to pause this video and see if you could figure out what A and B are going to be. Well, the first one to figure out, A is actually pretty straightforward. If n is equal to one, if n is equal to one, the first term when n equals one is four. So A is equal to four. So we could write this as g of n is equal to four if n is equal to one. And now let's think about the second line. The second line is interesting. It's saying it's going to be\\nequal to the previous term, g of n minus one. This means the n minus oneth term, plus B, will give you the nth term. Let's just think about what's happening with this arithmetic sequence. When I go from the first\\nterm to the second term, what have I done? Looks like I have subtracted 1/5, so minus 1/5, and then it's an arithmetic sequence so I should subtract or add\\nthe same amount to every time, and I am, I'm subtracting 1/5, and so I am subtracting 1/5. And so one way to think about it, if we were to go the other way, we could say, for example, that g of four is equal to g of three minus 1/5, minus 1/5. You see that right over here. g of three is this. You subtract 1/5, you get g of four. You see that right over there and of course I could have written this like g of four is equal to g of four minus one minus 1/5. So if you look at this way, you could see that if I'm\\ntrying to find the nth term, it's gonna be the n minus oneth term plus negative 1/5, so B is negative 1/5. Once again, if I'm trying\\nto find the fourth term, if n is equal to four, I'm not gonna use this first case 'cause this has to be for n equals one, so if n equals four, I\\nwould use the second case, so then it would be g of four minus one, it would be g of three minus 1/5. And so we could say g of n is equal to g of n minus one, so the term right before that minus 1/5 if n is greater than one. But for the sake of this problem, we see that A is equal to four and B is equal to negative 1/5. \"),\n",

       "  'So we see here in this table, that for given \"n\\'s\", when \"n\" is one, \"f\" of \"n\" is 12, when\\n\"n\" is 2, \"f\" of \"n\" is 5, and when \"n\" is three, \"f\"\\nof \"n\" is negative two, when \"n\" is four, \"f\"\\nof \"n\" is negative nine. And so one way to think about it is this function \"f\" is defining a sequence where the first term\\nof this sequence is 12. The second term of this sequence is five. The third term of this\\nsequence is negative two. The fourth term of the\\nsequence is negative nine. And it goes on, and on, and on. And you might notice that\\nit\\'s a arithmetic sequence. We start with a 12, and\\nthen the next term... What have we done? We\\'ve subtracted seven. Now to go from the second\\nto the third term... What do we do? We subtract seven. So each term is seven less\\nthan the term before it. Now with that out of the\\nway, see if you can define this function of \"n.\" If you\\ncan define it explicitly. So figure out a function definition. So I want to figure out\\n\"f\" of \"n\" is equal. I want you to figure out\\nwhat this needs to be so that if you input \"n\" here, it gives you the appropriate \"f\" of \"n.\" So let\\'s think about it a little bit. It\\'s going to be, we could think\\nof it as we\\'re starting at, The first term is going to be 12. But then, we are going to subtract seven. And what are we going to subtract seven? How many times are we\\ngoing to subtract seven? So for the first term, we\\nsubtract seven zero times. And so we just get 12. For the second term,\\nwe subtract seven once. For the third term, we subtract\\nseven twice. One, two times. For the fourth term, we\\nsubtract seven three times. So it looks like whatever term we\\'re on, we\\'re subtracting seven \"n\" minus one, we\\'re subtracting seven\\nwhatever term we\\'re on, that term minus one time. So it\\'s \"n\" minus one times. And let\\'s see if this actually works out. So \"f\" of one is going to\\nbe 12 minus seven times one minus one, that\\'s a zero. So that\\'s all just going to be 12. \"f\" of two is going to be 12 minus seven times two minus one. So it\\'s going to be 12\\nminus seven times one. We\\'re just going to subtract seven once, which is exactly the case. We started at 12, we subtract seven once. \"f\" of three, you can keep testing this. 12 minus, and we should have\\nto subtract seven twice. And we see three minus one, is two times. So we\\'re going to\\nsubtract seven two times. So this looks right on. We\\'ve defined the function explicitly. We\\'ve defined \"f\" explicitly\\nfor this sequence. Let\\'s do another example, here. So in this case, we have some function definitions already here. So you have your sequence, it\\'s kind of viewed in this table. You could view it as the\\nfirst term is negative 100. The next term is negative\\n50, next term is zero, next term is 50. And it\\'s very clear that this is also an arithmetic sequence. We\\'re starting at negative\\n100, and then, we\\'re adding 50. And then we\\'re adding 50, and then we are adding 50. So each term is 50 more\\nthan the term before it. And what I want you to\\ndo is pause the video, and think about which\\nof these definitions of the function \"f\" are correct. And it might be more than one. Alright, so let\\'s think about it. So this definition right over here, one way to think about it is by saying I\\'m going to start at negative 100. And I\\'m going to add\\n50, \"n\" minus one times. Does this make sense? Well, for the first term,\\nif we start at negative 100, we don\\'t want to add 50 at all, we want to add 50 zero\\ntimes, and it works out. Because one minus one is going to be zero. So it checks out for \"n\" equals one. Let\\'s see, for \"n\" equals two,\\nyou start at negative 100, I want to add 50 once. So this should be a one. Two minus one, yup, it\\'s a one! We\\'re adding 50. Whatever this number is, whatever \"n\" is, we\\'re adding 50 one less that number of times. So for here, we\\'re adding 50 twice. When \"n\" is four, we\\'re\\nadding 50 three times. And this one checks out. When \"n\" is four, we\\'re adding 50, four minus one, three times. Negative 100, plus 50 times three. We\\'re adding 50 three times, adding 50 one, two, three times. Well that gives you\\n50. So I like this one. Now let\\'s see about this one over here. Negative 150 plus 50 \"n.\" Alright, that\\'s one way\\nof saying, so let\\'s see If \"n\" is equal to one,\\nit\\'s going to be negative... Actually, let me draw\\na table for this one. So if we have \"n\" and we have \"f\" of \"n.\" This is going to be for this\\ncharacter right over here. So if \"n\" is one, it\\'s going\\nto negative 150, plus 50. Which is negative 100,\\nyup that checks out. When \"n\" is two, we get negative 150, plus 50 times two, which is going to be... This is 100, and there\\'s negative 150, this is going to be negative 50. When \"n\" is three, and\\nthat checks out, of course. When \"n\" is three, you get negative 150, plus 50, times three,\\nwhich is equal to zero. This checks out. This one over here is going to work. And you might say, \"Well, hey, these formulas look different.\" Well you can algebraically manipulate them to see that they\\'re the exact same thing. If you were to take this first one, it\\'s negative 100, plus,\\nlet\\'s distribute this 50, plus 50 \"n\", plus 50 \"n\", minus 50. Well, negative 100, minus\\n50, that\\'s negative 150. And then you have plus 50 \"n.\" So these are algebraically the exact same definition for our function. Now what about this one here? Negative 100 plus 50\\n\"n\", does this one work? Let\\'s see, when \"n\" is equal to one, this would be negative 100\\nplus 50, which is negative 50. Well no, this doesn\\'t work. We need to get a negative 100 here. So this one is not, not correct.

       "  \"- [Instructor] We are\\nasked what is the value of the 100th term in this sequence, and the first term is 15, then nine, then three, then negative three. So let's write it like this in a table. So if we have the term, just so we have things straight, and then we have the value, and then we have the value of the term. I'll do a nice little table here. So our first term we saw is 15. Our second term is nine. Our third term is three. I'm just really copying this down, but I'm making sure we associate\\nit with the right term. And then our fourth term, our fourth term is negative three. And they wanna ask, they want us to figure\\nout what the 100th term of this sequence is going to be. So let's see what's happening here, if we can discern some type of pattern. So we went from the first\\nterm to the second term, what happened? 15 to nine, looks like\\nwe went down by six. It's always good to\\nthink about just how much the numbers changed by. That's always the\\nsimplest type of pattern. So we went down by six, we subtracted six. Then to go from nine to three, well we subtracted six again. We subtracted six again. And then to go from\\nthree to negative three, well we, we subtracted six again. We subtracted six again. So it looks like every term, you subtract six. So the second term is going to be six less than the first term. The third term is going to be 12 minus from the first term, or six subtracted twice. So in the third term, you subtract a six twice. In the fourth term, you subtract six three times. So whatever term you're looking at, you subtract six one less\\nthan that many times. Let me write this down just so, notice when your first term, you have 15 and you don't\\nsubtract six at all, or you could say you\\nsubtract six zero times. So you could say this is 15 minus six times or let me\\nwrite it better this way, minus zero times six. That's what that first\\nterm is right there. What's the second term? This is 15, it's just we just subtracted six once, or you could say minus one times six. Or you could say plus\\none times negative six, either way, we're\\nsubtracting the six once. Now what's happening here? This is 15, this is 15 minus two times negative six, or sorry minus two times six, minus two times six. We're subtracting a six twice. What's the fourth term? This is 15 minus, we're subtracting the six\\nthree times from the 15, so minus three times six. So if you see the pattern here, when our term, when we\\nhave our fourth term, we have the term minus one right there, the fourth term we have a three, the third term we have a two, the second term we have a one. So if we had the nth term, if we just had the nth term here, what's this going to be? It's going to be 15 minus, you see it's going to\\nbe n minus one right here, right when n is four,\\nn minus one is three. When n is three, n minus one is two. When n is two, n minus one is one. When n is one, n minus one is zero. So we're going to have, this term right here is n minus one, so minus n minus one times six. So if you wanna figure out the\\n100th term of this sequence, I didn't even have to write\\nit in this general term, you could just look at this pattern. It's going to be, and I'll do it in pink, the 100th term in our sequence, I'll continue our table\\ndown, is gonna be what? It's going to be 15 minus 100 minus one, which is 99, times six, right? I just followed the pattern. One, you had a zero here,\\ntwo, you had a one here, three, you had a two here, 100, you're gonna have a 99 here. So let's just calculate what this is. What's 99 times six? So 99 times six, actually you could do this in your head. You could say that's going to be six less than 100 times six, which is 600, and six less is 594. But if you didn't wanna do it that way, you just do it the old-fashioned way. Six times nine is 54, carry the five. Nine times six or six times nine is 54. 54 plus five is 594. So this right here is 594, and then to figure out what 15, so we wanna figure out, we wanna figure out what 15 minus 594 is, and this can sometimes be confusing, but the way I always\\nprocess this in my head is I say that this is the exact same thing as the negative of 594 minus 15. And if you don't believe me, distribute out this negative sign. Negative one times 594 is negative 594, negative one times\\nnegative 15 is positive 15. So these two statements are equivalent. This is much easier for\\nmy brain to understand. So what's 594 minus 15? You should do it, we\\ncould do this in our head. 594 minus 14 would be 580, and then 580 minus one more would be 579. So that right there is 579, and then we have this negative\\nsign sitting out there. So our the 100th term in our sequence will be negative 579. \"),\n",

       "  \"- So I have a function here, h of n, and let's say that it explicitly defines the terms of a sequence. Let me make a little... Let me make a quick table here. We have n, and then we have h of n. When n is equal to one,\\nh of n is negative 31, minus seven times one minus one, which is going to be... This is just going to be zero, so it's going to be negative 31. When n is equal to two,\\nit's going to be negative 31 minus seven times two minus one, so two minus one. This is just going to be one, so it's negative 31 minus seven, which is equal to negative 38. When n is equal to three, it's gonna be negative 31 minus seven times three minus one, which is just two, so we're gonna subtract seven twice. It's gonna be negative 31 minus 14, which is equal negative 45. What do we see happening here? We're starting at negative 31, and then we keep subtracting, we keep subtracting negative seven. We keep subtracting\\nnegative seven from that. In fact we subtract negative\\nseven one less than the term... We subtract negative seven one less times than the term we're dealing with. If we're dealing with the third term we subtract negative seven twice. If we're dealing with the second term we subtract negative seven once. This is all nice, but what I want you to\\ndo now is pause the video and see if you can define\\nthis exact same sequence. The sequence here is you\\nstart at negative 31, and you keep subtracting negative seven, so negative 38, negative 45. The next one is gonna be negative 52, and you go on and on and on. You keep subtracting negative seven. Can we define this sequence in terms of a recursive function? Why don't you have a go at that. Let's try to define it in\\nterms of a recursive function. Let's just call that g of n, so g of n. In some ways a recursive\\nfunction is easier, because you can say okay look. The first term when n is equal to one, if n is equal to one,\\nlet me just write it, If n is equal to one, if n is equal to one, what's g of n gonna be? It's gonna be negative 31, negative 31. And if n, if n is greater than\\none and a whole number, so this is gonna be defined\\nfor all positive integers, and whole, and whole number, it's just going to be the previous term, so g of n minus one minus seven, minus seven. We're saying hey if we're just picking an arbitrary term we just have to look at the previous term and then subtract, and\\nthen subtract seven. It all works out nice and easy, because you keep looking at previous, previous, previous terms all the way until you\\nget to the base case, which is when n is equal to one, and you can build up back from that. You get this exact same sequence. Let's do another example, but let's go the other way around. Here we have a, we have a sequence defined recursively, and I want to create a function that defines a sequence explicitly. Let's think about this. One way to think about it, this sequence, when n is equal to one it starts at 9.6, and then every term is the previous term minus 0.1. The second term is gonna\\nbe the previous term minus 0.1, so it's gonna be 9.5. Then you're gonna go to 9.4. Then you're gonna go to 9.3. We could keep going on and on and on. If we want, we could\\nmake a little table here, and we could say this is n, this is h of n, and you see when n is equal to one, h of n is 9.6. When n is equal to two, we're now in this case over here, it's gonna h of two minus one, so it's gonna be h of one minus 0.1. It's just gonna be this minus 0.1, which is going to be 9.5. When h is three, it's gonna be h of two, h of two minus 0.1, minus 0.1. H of two is right over here. You subtract a tenth you're gonna get 9.4, exactly what we saw over here. Let's see if we can pause the video now and define this... Create a function that\\nconstructs or defines this arithmetic sequence explicitly. Here it was recursively. We wanna define it explicitly. So let's just call it, I don't know, let's just call it f of n. We can say look, it's gonna be 9.6, but we're gonna subtract, we're gonna subtract 0.1 a certain number of times depending on what term\\nwe're talking about. We're gonna subtract 0.1, but how many times are\\nwe gonna subtract it as a function of n? Let's see. If we're talking about the first term we subtract zero times. The second term we subtract one time. The third term we subtract two times. The fourth term we subtract three times. Whatever term we're talking about we subtract that term minus one times. If we're talking about the nth term, we subtracted this\\nvalue n minus one times. You can verify that this is going to work. When n is equal to one this term here is going to be zero, so this whole thing is gonna be zero. You get 9.6. When n is equal to two, two minus one, you subtract 0.1 one time. 9.6 minus 0.1 is 9.5. You could keep doing that. You could draw a table, and evaluate these if you want to. The key thing is your'e starting at 9.6 and you're subtracting 0.1 one fewer times than the\\nterm you're looking at. If you're looking at the if n is equal to, this is n is equal to four, well you're gonna subtract 0.1 three times, and you see that. Subtract 0.1 once, subtract 0.1 twice, subtract 0.1 three times. \"),\n",

       "  \"In this video I want to\\nintroduce you to the idea of a geometric sequence. And I have a ton of more\\nadvanced videos on the topic, but it's really a good place to\\nstart, just to understand what we're talking about\\nwhen someone tells you a geometric sequence. Now a good starting point is\\njust, what is a sequence? And a sequence is, you\\ncan imagine, just a progression of numbers. So for example, and this isn't\\neven a geometric series, if I just said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This is a sequence of numbers. It's not a geometric sequence,\\nbut it is a sequence. A geometric sequence is a\\nspecial progression, or a special sequence, of numbers,\\nwhere each successive number is a fixed multiple of\\nthe number before it. Let me explain what\\nI'm saying. So let's say my first number is\\n2 and then I multiply 2 by the number 3. So I multiply it\\nby 3, I get 6. And then I multiply 6 times the\\nnumber 3, and I get 18. Then I multiply 18 times the\\nnumber 3, and I get 54. And I just keep going\\nthat way. So I just keep multiplying\\nby the number 3. So I started, if we want to get\\nsome notation here, this is my first term. We'll call it a1 for\\nmy sequence. And each time I'm multiplying\\nit by a common number, and that number is often called\\nthe common ratio. So in this case, a1 is equal to\\n2, and my common ratio is equal to 3. So if someone were to tell\\nyou, hey, you've got a geometric sequence. a1 is equal to 90 and your\\ncommon ratio is equal to negative 1/3. That means that the first term\\nof your sequence is 90. The second term is negative\\n1/3 times 90. Which is what? That's negative 30, right? 1/3 times 90 is 30, and then you\\nput the negative number. Then the next number is going\\nto be 1/3 times this. So negative 1/3 times this. 1/3 times 30 is 10. The negatives cancel out,\\nso you get positive 10. Then the next number is going\\nto be 10 times negative 1/3, or negative 10/3. And then the next number is\\ngoing to be negative 10/3 times negative 1/3 so it's going\\nto be positive 10/3. And you could just keep going\\non with this sequence. So that's what people talk\\nabout when they mean a geometric sequence. I want to make one little\\ndistinction here. This always used to confuse me\\nbecause the terms are used very often in the\\nsame context. These are sequences. These are kind of a progression\\nof numbers. 2, then 6, then 18, 90, then\\nnegative 30, then 10, then negative 10/3. Then, I'm sorry, this is\\npositive 10/9, right? Negative 1/3 times negative\\n10/3, negatives cancel out. Right. 10/9. Don't want to make\\na mistake here. These are sequences. You might also see the\\nword a series. And you might even see\\na geometric series. A series, the most conventional\\nuse of the word series, means a sum\\nof a sequence. So for example, this is\\na geometric sequence. A geometric series would be 90\\nplus negative 30, plus 10, plus negative 10/3, plus 10/9. So a general way to view\\nit is that a series is the sum of a sequence. I just want to make that clear\\nbecause that used to confuse me a lot when I first learned\\nabout these things. But anyway, let's go back to\\nthe notion of a geometric sequence, and actually do a word\\nproblem that deals with one of these. So they're telling us that Anne\\ngoes bungee jumping off of a bridge above water. On the initial jump, the cord\\nstretches by 120 feet. So on a1, our initial\\njump, the cord stretches by 120 feet. We could write it this way. We could write, jump, and then\\nhow much the cord stretches. So on the initial jump,\\non jump one, the cord stretches 120 feet. Then it says, on the next\\nbounce, the stretch is 60% of the original jump, and then\\neach additional bounce stretches the rope 60% of\\nthe previous stretch. So here, the common ratio, where\\neach successive term in our sequence is going to be\\n60% of the previous term. Or it's going to be 0.6 times\\nthe previous term. So on the second jump, we're\\ngoing to start 60% of that, or 0.6 times 120. Which is equal to what? That's equal to 72. Then on the third jump, we're\\ngoing to stretch 0.6 of 72, or 0.6 times this. So it would be 0.6 times\\n0.6 times 120. Notice, over here, so on the\\nfourth jump we're going to have 0.6 times 0.6 times\\n0.6 times 120. 60% of this jump, so every\\ntime we're 60% of the previous jump. So if we wanted to make a\\ngeneral formula for this, just based on the way we've defined\\nit right here. So the stretch on the nth\\njump, what would it be? So let's see, we start at 120\\ntimes 0.6 to the what? To the n minus 1. How did I get this? Let me write this a\\nlittle bit here. So this is equal to 0.6,\\nactually let me write the 120 first. This is equal to 120\\ntimes 0.6 to the n minus 1. How did I get that? Well we're defining the first\\njump as stretching 120 feet. So when you put n is equal to 1\\nhere, you get 1 minus 1, 0. So you have 0.6 to the\\n0th power, and you've just got a 1 here. And that's exactly what happened\\non the first jump. Then on the second jump, you put\\na 2 minus 1, and notice 2 minus 1 is the first\\npower, and we have exactly one 0.6 here. So I figured it was n minus 1\\nbecause when n is 2, we have one 0.6, when n is 3, we have\\ntwo 0.6's multiplied by themselves. When n is 4, we have 0.6\\nto the third power. So whatever n is, we're taking\\n0.6 to the n minus 1 power, and of course we're multiplying\\nthat times 120. Now and the question they also\\nask us, what will be the rope stretch on the 12th bounce? And over here I'm going\\nto use the calculator. and actually let me correct\\nthis a little bit. This isn't incorrect, but\\nthey're talking about the bounce, and we could call the\\njump the zeroth bounce. Let me change that. This isn't wrong, but I think\\nthis is where they're going with the problem. So you can view the initial\\nstretch as the zeroth bounce. So instead of labeling it jump,\\nlet me label it bounce. So the initial stretch is the\\nzeroth bounce, then this would be the first bounce, the second bounce, the third bounce. And then our formula becomes\\na lot simpler. Because if you said the stretch\\non nth bounce, then the formula just becomes 0.6\\nto the n times 120, right? On the zeroth bounce, that was\\nour original stretch, you get 0.6 to the 0, that's\\n1 times 120. On the first bounce, 0.6 to\\nthe 1, one 0.6 right here. 0.6 times the previous\\nstretch, or the previous bounce. So this has it in terms of\\nbounces, which I think is what the questioner wants us to do. So what about the 12th bounce? Using this convention\\nright there. So if we do the 12th bounce,\\nlet's just get our calculator out. We're going to have 120 times\\n0.6 to the 12th power. And hopefully we'll get order\\nof operations right, because exponents take precedence over\\nmultiplication, so it'll just take the 0.6 to the\\n12th power only. And so this is equal\\nto 0.26 feet. So after your 12th bounce,\\nshe's going to be barely moving. She's going to be moving about\\n3 inches on that 12th bounce. Well, hopefully you found\\nthis helpful. And I apologize for the slight\\ndivergence here, but I actually think on some level\\nthat's instructive. Because you always have to make\\nsure that your n matches well with what your\\nresults are. So when I talked about\\nyour first jump, I said, OK this is 1. And then I had 0.6 to\\nthe zeroth power, so I did n minus 1. But then when I relabeled things\\nin terms of bounces, this was the zeroth bounce. This makes sense that this is\\n0.6 to the zeroth power. This is the first bounce,\\nso this would be 0.6 to the first power. Second bounce, 0.6 to\\nthe second power. It made our equation a\\nlittle bit simpler. Anyway, hopefully you found\\nthat Interesting. \"),\n",

And like always pause the video and see if you can come\\nup with the fifth term. Well what we have to remind ourselves is for a geometric sequence\\neach successive term is the previous term\\nmultiplied by some number. And that number we call the common ratio. So let's think about it. To go from negative 1/32,\\nthat's the first term to 1/8, what do we have to multiply by? What do we have to multiply by? Let's see. We're going to multiply, it's going to be multiplied by a negative since we went from a\\nnegative to a positive. So we're going to multiply by negative and there's going to be a one over let's see to go from a 32 to an eight, actually it's not going to be a one over. It's going to be, this is\\nfour times as large as that. It's going to be negative four. Negative 1/32 times negative\\nfour is positive 1/8. Just to make that clear. Negative 1/32 times negative four that's the same thing\\nas times negative four over one. It's going to be positive. Negative times a negative is a positive. Positive four over 32. Which is equal to 1/8. Now let's see if that holds up. So to go from 1/8 to negative 1/2 we once again would\\nmultiply by negative four. Negative four times 1/8 is negative 4/8, which is negative 1/2 and so then we multiply\\nby negative four again. So, let me make it clear. We're multiplying by\\nnegative four each time. You multiply by negative four again, you get to positive two. Because negative four over negative two, you can do it that way, is positive two. And so to get the fifth\\nterm in the sequence, we would multiply by negative four again. And so two times negative\\nfour is negative eight. Negative four is the common ratio for this geometric sequence. But just to answer the question, What is the fifth term? It is going to be negative eight. \"),\n",

A sub five is going to be... is everywhere I see an\\nI or a place with a five is going to be equal to three\\ntimes negative one fourth to the five minus one power. Well that's equal to three\\ntimes negative one fourth to the fourth power. Well that's going to be equal to... lets see, we're raising\\nit to an even power so it's going to give us a positive value since we're gonna be\\nmultiplying the negative an even number of times so\\nit's gonna be a positive value so it's gonna be three times... let's see, one to the one fourth is- oh, one to the fourth power is just one, and then four to the fourth power... let's see, four squared is 16, so four squared times four\\nsquared is four to the fourth so it's 16 times 16 is 256. 256. And once again I know\\nit's going to be positive because I'm multiplying a\\nnegative times itself four times, or I'm multiplying four\\nnegatives together, so that's going to give\\nme a positive value.

       "  \"- [Voiceover] The\\ngeometric sequence a sub i, is defined by the formula\\nwhere the first term, a sub one is equal to negative 1/8, and then every term after\\nthat is defined as being, so a sub i is going to be two\\ntimes the term before that. A sub i is two times a sub i, minus one. What is a sub four, the\\nfourth term in the sequence? Pause the video, and see\\nif you can work this out. Well there's a couple of ways\\nthat you could tackle this. One is to just directly\\nuse these formulas. We could say that a sub four, well that's going to be\\nthis case right over here. A sub four is going to be\\nequal to two times a sub three. Well, a sub three, if we\\ngo and use this formula, is going to be equal\\nto two times a sub two. Each term is equal to two\\ntimes the term before it. Then we go back to this formula again, and say a sub two is going\\nto be two times a sub one. Two times a sub one. Lucky for us, we know that\\na sub one is negative 1/8. It's going to be two times negative 1/8, which is equal to negative 1/4. Negative 1/4. So this is negative 1/4. Two times negative 1/4,\\nis equal to negative 2/4, or negative 1/2. A sub four is two times a sub three. A sub three is negative 1/2. So this is going to be\\ntwo times negative 1/2, which is going to be\\nequal to negative one. So that's one way to solve it. Another way to think about it is, look, we have our initial term. We also know our common ratio. We know each successive term is two times the term before it. So we could explicitly, this is a recursive definition\\nfor our geometric series. We could explicitly write it as a sub i is going to be equal to our\\ninitial term negative 1/8. Then we're going to multiply it by two. We're going to multiply it\\nby two, i minus one times. So we could say times two,\\nto the i minus oneth power. Let's make sure that makes sense. A sub one, based on this formula, a sub one would be negative 1/8, times two to the one minus one. Two to the zeroeth power. So that makes sense. That would be negative 1/8. Based on this formula, a sub two would be negative 1/8, times two to the two minus one. So two to the first power. We're going to take our initial term, and multiply it by two, once. Which is exactly right. A sub two is negative 1/4. So we want to find the\\nfourth term in the sequence, we could just say well,\\nusing this explicit formula, we could say a sub four,\\nis equal to negative 1/8, times two to the four, minus one. Two to the four, minus one power. So this is equal to negative 1/8, times two to the third power. This is negative 1/8 times eight. Negative 1/8 times eight,\\nwhich is equal to negative one. You might be a little bit,\\na toss up on which method you want to use, but for\\nsure this second method, right over here where we'd come\\nup with an explicit formula once we know the initial term, and we know the common ratio, this would be way easier, if\\nyou were trying to find say, the 40th term.

       "  \"- [Voiceover] So, this table here where you're given a bunch of Ns, N equals one, two, three, four, and we get the corresponding G of N. And one way to think about\\nit is that this function, G, defines a sequence where N\\nis the term of the sequence. So for example, we could\\nsay this is the same thing as the sequence where\\nthe first term is 168, second term is 84, third term is 42, and fourth term is 21,\\nand we keep going on, and on, and on. Now, let's think about what\\ntype of a sequence this is. If we think of it as starting at 168, and how do we go from 168 to 84? Well, one way, you could\\nsay we subtract at 84, but another way to think about it is you multiply it by one half. So, times one half. And then to go from 84 to 42, you multiply by one half again. Times one half. And to go from 42 to 21, you\\nmultiply by one half again. So, this right over here\\nis a geometric series. We're starting at a term\\nand every successive term is the previous term\\ntimes, it's often called the common ratio, times one half. So, how can we write G\\nof N, how can we define this explicitly in terms of N? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about how to do that. So, construct a, so,\\nif I say G of N equals, think of a function\\ndefinition that describes what we've just seen here starting at 168, and then multiplying\\nby one half every time you add a new term. Well, one way to think\\nabout it is we start at 168, and then we're gonna multiply by one half, we're gonna multiply by one\\nhalf a certain number of times. So, we could view the exponent\\nas the number of times we multiply by one half. And how many times are we\\ngonna multiply by one half? The first term, we multiply\\nby one half zero times. The second term, we multiply\\nby one half one time. Third term, we multiply\\nby one half two times. Fourth term, we multiply\\nby one half three times. So, the figure, it seems\\nlike whatever term we're on, we're multiplying by one half,\\nthat term minus one times. And you can see that this works. If N is equal to one, you're going to have one minus one, that's just gonna be zero. One half to the zero's just one. So, you're just gonna get a 168. If N is two, well, two minus one, you're gonna multiply\\nby one half one time, which you see right over here, N is three, you're gonna multiply by one half twice. Three minus two is, or,\\nthree minus one is two. You're gonna multiply by one half twice, and you see that right over there. So, this feels like a really\\nnice explicit definition for this geometric series. And you can think of it in other ways, you could write this\\nas G of N is equal to, let's see, one way you could write it, as, you could write it as 168,\\nand I'm just algebraically manipulating it over\\ntwo to the N minus one. Another way you could think about it is, well, let's use our exponent\\nproperties a little bit, we could say G of N is\\nequal to, let's see, one half to the N minus\\none, that's the same thing as one half, let me write this. It's equal to 168. Lemme do this in a different color. So, this part right over\\nhere is the same thing as one half to the N. So, times one half to\\nthe N, times one half to the negative one. One half to the negative one. Well, one half to the negative one is just two, is just two, so, this is times two. So, we could rewrite this whole thing as 168 times two is what? 336? 336, did I do that right? 160 times two would be 320, plus 16, two times eight, so yeah, 336. And then times one half to the N. Times one half to the N. So, these are equivalent statements. This one makes a little\\nbit more intuitive sense, it kinda jumps out at you,\\nyou're starting at 168 and you're multiplying by one half. Whatever term you are minus one times. But this is algebraically\\nequivalent to this, to our original one. But, can we also define\\nG of N recursively? And I encourage you to pause\\nthe video and try to do that. In a lot of ways, the recursive definition is a little bit more straight\\nforward, so let's do that. G, well, I'll make the\\nrecursive function a different, well, I got, I'll stick\\nwith G of N since it's on this table right over here. G of N is equal to, and so, let's see, if we're going to, when N equals one, if N is equal to one,\\nwe're starting at 168. 168, and if N is greater than one and a whole number, so, if N, so, we're, this is gonna be defined\\nover all positive integers, and whole number, what are we gonna do? Well, we're gonna take\\none half and multiply it times the previous term. So, it's gonna be one half\\ntimes G of N minus one. And you can verify that this works. If N is equal to one, we\\njust go right over here, it's gonna be 168. G of two is gonna be\\none half times G of one, which is, of course, 168. so, 168 times one half is 84. G of three is gonna be\\none half times G of two, which it is, G of three is\\none half times G of two. So, this is how we would define, this is the explicit\\ndefinition of this sequence, this is a recursive function\\nto define this sequence. \"),\n",

       "  \"So I have the function g\\nof x is equal to 9 times 8 to the x minus 1 power. And it's defined for\\nx being a positive-- or if x is a positive-- integer. If x is a positive integer. So we could say the\\ndomain of this function, or all the valid inputs\\nhere are positive integers. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\\non and on and on. So this is an explicitly\\ndefined function. What I now want to do is to\\nwrite a recursive definition of this exact same function. That given an x, it'll give\\nthe exact same outputs. So let's first just try\\nto understand the inputs and outputs here. So let's make a little table. Let's make a table here. And let's think\\nabout what happens when we put in various x's\\ninto this function definition. So the domain is\\npositive integers. So let's try a couple of them. 1, 2, 3, 4. And then see what the\\ncorresponding g of x is. g of x. So when x is equal\\nto 1, g of x is 9 times 8 to the\\n1 minus 1 power, 9 times 8 to the 0\\npower, or 9 times 1. So g of x is going to be just 9. When x is 2, what's\\ngoing to happen? It'll be 9 times 8\\nto the 2 minus 1. So that's the same thing as\\n9 times 8 to the 1st power. And that's just going\\nto be 9 times 8. So that is 72. Actually let me just\\nwrite it that way. Let me write it\\nas just 9 times 8. 9 times 8. Then when x is equal to\\n3, what's going on here? Well this is going\\nto be 3 minus 1 is 2. So it's going to be 8 squared. So it's going to be\\n9 times 8 squared. So we could write that\\nas 9 times 8 times 8. I think you see a little\\nbit of a pattern forming. When x is 4, this is going to be\\n8 to the 4 minus 1 power, or 9 to the 3rd power. So that's 9 times\\n8 times 8 times 8. So this gives a\\ngood clue about how we would define\\nthis recursively. Notice, if our first term,\\nwhen x equals 1 is 9, every term after that is 8\\ntimes the preceding term. Is 8 times the preceding term. 8 times the preceding term. 8 times the preceding term. So let's define that as\\na recursive function. So first define our base case. So we could say\\ng of x-- and I'll do this is a new color\\nbecause I'm overusing the red. I like the blue. g of x. Well we can define\\nour base case. It's going to be equal\\nto 9 if x is equal to 1. g of x equals 9 if x equals 1. So that took care of\\nthat right over there. And then if it\\nequals anything else it equals the previous g of x. So if we're looking at--\\nlet's go all the way down to x minus 1, and then an x. So if this entry right over\\nhere is g of x minus 1, however many times\\nyou multiply the 8s and we have a 9 in front,\\nso this is g of x minus 1. We know that g of x-- we know\\nthat this one right over here is going to be the previous\\nentry, g of x minus 1. The previous entry times 8. So we could write\\nthat right here. Times 8. So for any other\\nx other than 1, g of x is equal to the previous\\nentry-- so it's g of-- I'll do that in a blue color--\\ng of x minus 1 times 8. If x is greater than 1, or\\nx is integer greater than 1. Now let's verify that\\nthis actually works. So let's draw\\nanother table here. So once again, we're\\ngoing to have x and we're going to have g of x. But this time we're going to\\nuse this recursive definition for g of x. And the reason\\nwhy it's recursive is it's referring to itself. In its own definition, it's\\nsaying hey, g of x, well if x doesn't equal 1 it's going\\nto be g of x minus 1. It's using the function itself. But we'll see that it\\nactually does work out. So let's see... When x is equal to 1, so g\\nof 1-- well if x equals 1, it's equal to 9. It's equal to 9. So that was pretty\\nstraightforward. What happens when x equals 2? Well when x equals 2, this\\ncase doesn't apply anymore. We go down to this case. So when x is equal\\nto 2 it's going to be equivalent\\nto g of 2 minus 1. Let me write this down. It's going to be equivalent\\nto g of 2 minus 1 times 8, which is the same thing\\nas g of 1 times 8. And what's g of 1? Well g of 1 is right over here. g of 1 is 9. So this is going to\\nbe equal to 9 times 8. Exactly what we got over here. And of course this was\\nequivalent to g of 2. So let me write this. This is g of 2. Let me scroll over\\na little bit so I don't get all scrunched up. So now let's go to 3. Let's go to 3. And right now I'll\\nwrite g of 3 first. So g of 3 is equal\\nto-- we're going to this case-- it's equal\\nto g of 3 minus 1 times 8. So that's equal\\nto g of 2 times 8. Well what's g of 2? Well g of 2, we already\\nfigured out is 9 times 8. So it's equal to 9 times 8--\\nthat's g of 2-- times 8 again. And so you see we get\\nthe exact same results. So this is the recursive\\ndefinition of this function. \"),\n",

Each year thereafter, the number of leaves was 40% more than the year before. Let n be a positive integer,\\nand let f of n denote the number of leaves on\\nthe tree in Mohamed's back yard in the nth year\\nsince he started tracking it. The expression f of n defines a sequence. What kind of sequence is f of n? So, some of you might be able to think about this in your head. Each successive year we're growing by 40%, that's the same thing\\nas multiplying by 1.4. Each successive term we're multiplying or dividing by the same number. Well, that's going to be geometric. Let's make that a little\\nbit more tangible, just in case. So, let's make a little table here. So, table. So, this is n and this is f of n. So when n is equal to one, the first year, n equals\\none, there were 500 leaves. F of n is 500. Now, when n is equal to two we're going to grow by 40%, which is the same thing as multiplying by 1.4. So 500 times 1.4, let's\\ndo 40% of 500 is 200, so we're going to grow by 200, so we're going to go to 700. Then in year three, we're\\ngoing to grow by 40% of 700, which is 280, so\\nit's going to grow to 980. Notice it's definitely not\\nan arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence, we would be adding or subtracting the same amount every time, but we're not. Here, from 500 to 700, we grew by 200, and then from 700 to 980, we grew by 280. Instead, we're multiplying or dividing by the same amount each time. In this case, we're multiplying by 1.4, by 1.4 each time. So we are clearly geometric. Depending on your answer\\nto the question above, the recursive definition\\nof the sequence can have one of the following two forms. Well this is the arithmetic form, which we know isn't the case,\\nso it's going to be in the geometric form. And then they ask us, what are the values of the parameters A\\nand B for the sequence? So we have our base case\\nhere, f of n is going to be equal to A when n is equal to one. Well, we know that when n equals one, we had 500 leaves on the\\ntree so A, this A over here, is 500, so A is 500, and then if we're not in the base case for any other year, we are going to have,\\nlet's see, it's going to be the previous year, the\\nprevious year times what? It's going to be the\\nprevious year grown by 40%, to grow by 40%, you're\\ngoing to multiply by 1.4 so B is going to be 1.4. You take the previous\\nyear and you multiply by 1.4 for any other year, any year other than n equals one. So, B is equal to 1.4, and we're done. Let's do another example. This is strangely fun. All right, so this says:\\nSeo-Yun hosted a party. She had 50 party favors\\nto give away, and she gave away three party\\nfavors to each of her guests as they arrived at the party. Let n be a positive integer,\\nand let g of n denote the number of party\\nfavors Seo-Yun had before the nth guest arrived. All right, actually, before I\\neven look at these questions, let me make a table here\\nbecause they're saying before the nth guest. I want to make sure I'm\\nunderstanding this properly. So this is n, and then this is going to be g of n, right over here. So, when n is equal to one, when n is equal to one,\\ng of n is going to be, or g of one is going to be\\nthe number of party favors Seo-Yun had before the first guest. Well, before the first guest,\\nshe had 50 party favors. She had 50 party favors. Now, the second guest comes. Now the number of party\\nfavors she had before the second guest, well,\\nshe had to give three to the first guest, so she's now going to have 47 party favors. Now, when n is equal to three, how many party favors did she have before the third guest? Well, she would've had\\nto give party favors to the first and second\\nguest, who each got three. So, she would have 44, and\\nI think you see the pattern. For every time n, when n\\nequals one, g of n is 50, and every time we increase n by one, every time we increment\\nn, we are increasing g of n by plus three, by\\nminus three, I should say because she's giving away\\nparty favors, minus three. Minus three. So because the difference\\nbetween successive terms is the same, we know this\\nis an arithmetic sequence. This is an arithmetic\\nsequence and then they say write an explicit\\nformula for the sequence. So let's think about this. Let's see, g of n is\\ngoing to be equal to... Let's see, we're going to start at 50 then we're going to subtract\\nthree, and let's think, do we subtract three times n or is it...? Let's see, for the first guest, we subtract three zero times. For the second guest,\\nwe subtract three once. For the third guest, we\\nsubtract three twice. So, for the nth guest, we're\\ngoing to subtract three n minus one time. Notice, for the nth guest,\\nwe subtracted three twice. The second guest, subtracted three once. First guest, subtracted three zero times, so this works out. For the first guest, we would\\nsubtract three zero times, and so g of one would be 50. We can see that this is\\nconsistent for all of these. So I could write 50 minus\\nthree times n minus one, and I really recommend\\nmaking the table here just so you make sure\\nyou get the n minus one or the n right and it all gels. \"),\n",

So g of one, if n is equal to one, well, then we\\'re gonna hit\\nthis case right over here, if n is equal to one, g is equal to four. So that was pretty straightforward. Now, g of two, if n is equal to two, well, two is greater than\\none and it\\'s a whole number, and so we would use this case.

The first term is four, second term is 7.2, next term is 10.4, next term is 13.6, and it could keep going on and on and on. And what\\'s happening? What\\'s\\nhappening in this sequence? Well, we\\'re starting with four. We\\'re starting with four, and this case of the\\nfunction gave us that. If n is equal to four, if n is equal to one, the function is going to be equal to four, and then for each term after that, you take the previous\\nterm and you add 3.2. So we add 3.2 for the\\nsecond term, we add 3.2, so we just keep adding, we just keep adding 3.2, not .32, 3.2 to get to the next term. Now, we could\\'ve defined it\\nthat way, we could\\'ve said, \"Hey, let\\'s have a sequence\\nwhere the first term is four \"and then we keep adding\\n3.2 to get each next term.\" But this is another\\ninteresting way of defining it. And this way of defining it, where we defined it as\\nan algebraic function, a function that\\'s defined\\nover all positive integers, where we have a base case. And a base case, really, in this case, gave us our first term, and then we have this other case that\\'s defined in terms of the function. Then you have to recurse backwards to eventually get to a base case. We call this a recursive function. Recursive function. So with this example, we\\'re seeing how a recursive function can be used to define an actual sequence. And we went in order here, but you could\\'ve gone\\nthe other way around. If I said, \"Oh, well, what\\'s g of, \"what\\'s g of six?\" Well, you\\'d go into this case, you\\'d say, \"OK, that\\'s going to\\nbe g of five plus 3.2.\" It\\'s gonna be the previous term plus 3.2 if we view it as a sequence. Well, then we\\'re gonna have to figure out what the previous term is. G of five is going to be g of four, g of four plus 3.2, and you would keep going\\nback and back and back, but we\\'ve already figured\\nout what g of four is. It\\'s 13.6, so this is 16.8, and then if g of five is 16.8, 16.8, you add 3.2 there, you would get 20. So you could start at g of\\nsix and keep backing up, all the way until you get to g of one, and then you figure out what that is. You recurse back to your base case, and then you\\'re able to\\nfill in all of the blanks. Let\\'s do a few more examples of this. So we have this function here. So let\\'s say that this defines a sequence. Let\\'s think about what\\nthe first four terms of that sequence are, and once again, I encourage you to pause the\\nvideo and figure that out. All right, let\\'s work through it. So h of one is, well,\\nthey very clearly tell us that\\'s going to be 14. If n is equal to one, h is 14. H of two, well, now we\\'re falling into this case, \\'cause two is greater than\\none and it\\'s a whole number, so it\\'s gonna be 28 over h of one, over h of one. Well, we know h of one is 14, so it\\'s gonna be 28 over\\n14, which is equal to two. Now h of three. H of three, we\\'re gonna\\nfall into this case again. It\\'s gonna be 28, 28 divided by h of two, if we\\'re thinking of this as a sequence, divided by the previous\\nterm in the sequence. So 28 divided by h of two, we know that h of two is equal to, is equal to two. We just figured that out. So we go back to 14,\\nsomething very interesting. I think you see where this is going. H of four is gonna be 28\\ndivided by h of three, 28 divided by h of three, which is 28 divided by, this is h of three right over here, we just figured that out, divided by 14, which is back to two. If we were to think of this as a sequence, we\\'d say, \"All right, let\\'s\\nsee, the first term is 14, \"then we get to two, \"then we go to 14, \"then we get to two.\" So one way to think about this sequence is that we just keep alternating\\nbetween 14 and twos. All of the odd terms\\nof the sequence are 14, all of the even terms\\nof the sequence are two. That\\'s one way to think about it. Or another way to think about it is, we\\'re starting with 14, and each successive term is\\nthe previous term divided, is 28 divided by the previous term. So here, 28 divided by 14 is two. 28 divided by two is 14.\\n28 divided by 14 is two. And we keep going on and on and on, and that\\'s what was actually\\ngoing on right over there. Let\\'s do one more of these. And this one is interesting, because we now have, we now have two base cases. So let\\'s think about this. This is, and actually let\\'s just say we wanted to figure out, we\\nwanted to figure out what, what f of four is. F of four, well, we\\'re\\ngonna fall into this case. Four is greater than two\\nand it\\'s a whole number. It\\'s gonna be f of four minus two, so it\\'s gonna be f of two\\nplus f of four minus one, plus f of three. So f of four is gonna be the sum of the preceding two numbers. All right, so let\\'s figure out what f of three is going to be. F of three, we fall into this case again, it\\'s gonna be f of three\\nminus two is f of one, plus f of three minus one, plus f of two, the sum of the preceding two numbers. So let\\'s figure out what\\nf of two is going to be. Well, now we\\'re not doing the sum of the preceding two numbers anymore. We fall into this base\\ncase. N is now equal to two. It\\'s going to be equal to negative four. And we\\'re gonna have to figure out what f of one is as well. And we see when n is equal to one, f is equal to negative six. We have two base cases right over here. Base cases, cases that aren\\'t defined in terms of the function itself. And you need that, \\'cause otherwise you\\'d\\njust be recursing forever. You would never get to actual numbers. But now we can use these to\\nfill in the values up here. So the sequence is negative six, then we go to negative\\nfour as the second term, and then the third term is\\nthe sum of the previous two. Negative six plus negative\\nfour is negative 10. Negative six plus negative\\nfour is negative 10. And then the fourth term is\\nthe sum of the previous two. We see it right over here. The second term, f of\\ntwo, plus f of three. Negative four plus\\nnegative 10 is negative 14. And we could keep going on\\nand on and on like that. So this right over here is negative 14. So the whole point of this video, you\\'re a little bit familiar\\nwith recursive functions now, and also you can see how these can be used to define actual sequences. '),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] The focus\\nof this video is going to be on sequences, which you have hopefully already seen. If you don't know what a sequence is, I encourage you to review\\nthose videos on Khan Academy. But we're going to focus on how we can generate the same sequence with different functions\\nthat have different domains. So let's just start with\\nan example sequence. Let's say we have a sequence. It's a six. You could call that the first term. Some people would call\\nthat the zeroth term, six. And then if that's the first term, the second term is now a 12, then a 24, then a 48, and so on and so forth. And as we'll see, there's\\nmultiple function definitions that could create the sequence. One way to think about it\\nis this is six times one. This is six times two. This is six times four. This is six times eight. So it looks like each term is six times a power of two. Let me make that clear. This one right over here is\\nsix times two to the zero. That's six times one. This one over here is six\\ntimes two to the first. This one over here is\\nsix times two squared, six times four. This right over here is six times two to the third. And so one way to view this is if you view this as the zeroth term. We could define a function, call it a of n, where n is referring to our index or which term in the sequence. And it's equal to six times two, six times two to the n, where n starts at zero, and then it keeps incrementing by one. So it's really all integers\\ngreater than or equal to zero. And it's very important\\nto specify that domain, where n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to zero. You could see what happens\\nif n is not an integer. If you tried to put a 1.5 year or something like that,\\nthen you're not going to get one of the terms in the sequence. And if we don't start at\\nzero, if we started at one, then this would be the\\nfirst term in the sequences, which is not what we want. We want to generate the sequence that I originally wrote down. And obviously, if you started\\nat n equals negative one, then you're gonna get a different\\nvalue for your first term. So this is one way to essentially define or create a function which generates this sequence. But as we'll see, there\\nare other ways to do it. For example, let me do another one. I'll do it in another color. Let's say I have b of n. And let's say I want to, instead of saying, okay, I'm\\ngonna start at n equals zero, and you could kind of view\\nthis as the zeroth term, I want to start at n equals one. So what you could do is, is when you input a one, this\\nessentially becomes a zero. How do I do that? Well, I just subtract one from it. So I could say six times two to the n minus one power, where n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to one. Notice, now when we put\\nn equals one in here, we could maybe call this the first term. We want to generate a six. So what happens? One minus one, we get that zeroth power that we want right over there. And so six times two to\\nthe zero is indeed six. Then when n is equal to two, it's six times two to the two minus one, which is just two to the first power. So it just becomes six times\\ntwo, which is equal to 12. So notice, these are\\ndifferent function definitions with different domains, but they're generating\\nthe exact same sequence. We could also do it recursively. And we've seen this in other videos. We can define a function recursively. We could say, all right, look, it looks like each of these terms in our sequence is\\ntwice the previous term. So we could, if we want a recursive\\ndefinition for the sequence, we can define the first term, or, in this case, we\\ncould say the zeroth term if we want to start at n equals zero. T of zero is equal to six. And then we could say t of n is equal to two times t of n minus one, t of n minus one. And then this is going to be for, or maybe I'll write it this way, where n is an integer and n is greater than or equal to zero. This would also generate the sequence. When you put n equals zero\\nhere, you'll get that term. When you get n equals one, t of one is going to be two times t of one minus one, t of zero. In that case, it'd be t of, or, sorry, it would be two\\ntimes t of zero is six. So two times six, it would get you 12. Now if you wanted it so\\nthat it generates the six when n equals one, you\\ncould do it this way. You could write it, actually, maybe I should\\nhave kept all of that, or I'm gonna have to rewrite all of that. But you could write it this way. Instead of saying t of\\nzero is equal to six, we could write t of one is equal to six. But now we'd have to\\nwrite a different domain, where n still has to be an integer. N is an integer. And now instead of saying n is greater than or equal to zero, now n is greater than or equal to one. So hopefully this video\\nhits the point home that there's multiple ways, either with a traditional, I guess you would say explicit function or a recursive function like this. And even in either of those cases, you could have different domains and different function definitions that generate the same sequence, but you really have to\\nthink about the domain. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] This right over here is the graph of y is equal\\nto absolute value of x which you might be familiar with. If you take x is equal to negative two, the absolute value of\\nthat is going to be two. Negative one, absolute value is one. Zero, absolute value is zero. One, absolute value is one. So on and so forth. What I wanna do in this video is think about how the\\nequation will change if we were to shift this graph. So in particular, we're\\ngonna first think about what would be the equation\\nof this graph if we shift, if we shift three to the right and then think about how that will change if not only do we shift three to the right but we also shift four up, shift four up, and so once again pause this\\nvideo like we always say and figure out what would the equation be if you shift three to\\nthe right and four up? Alright, now let's do this together. So let's just first\\nshift three to the right and think about how that\\nmight change the equation. So let's just visualize what\\nwe're even talking about. So if we're gonna shift\\nthree to the right, it would look like, it would look like this. So that's what we first wanna\\nfigure out the equation for and so how would we think about it? Well, one way to think about it is, well, something interesting is happening right over here at x equals three. Before, that interesting\\nthing was happening at x equals zero. Now, it's happening at x equals three. And the interesting\\nthing that happens here is that you switch signs\\ninside the absolute value. Instead of taking an\\nabsolute value of a negative, you're now taking the absolute value as you cross this point of a positive and that's why we see a\\nswitch in direction here of this line and so you see the same thing\\nhappening right over here. So at this point right over here, we know that our function, we know that our equation\\nneeds to evaluate out to zero and this is where it's\\ngoing to switch signs and so we say, okay, well, this\\nlooks like an absolute value so it's going to have the form, y is equal to the absolute\\nvalue of something and so you say, okay, if x is three, how do I make that equal to zero? Well, I can subtract three from it. If I say y is equal to the\\nabsolute value of x minus three, well, let's try it out. Let's see if it makes sense. So when x is equal to three, three minus three is zero, absolute value of that is zero. That works out. When x is equal to four, four minus three is one,\\nabsolute value of one is indeed, is indeed one. And if x is equal to two, well, two minus three is negative one but the absolute value of that is one. So once again, I'm showing you this by really trying out numbers, trying to give you a\\nlittle bit of an intuition because that wasn't obvious to\\nme when I first learned this that if I'm shifting to the right which it looks like I'm\\nincreasing an x value but what I would really do is replace my x with an x minus the amount\\nthat I'm shifting to the right but I encourage you to try numbers and think about what's happening here. At this vertex right over here, whatever was in the absolute\\nvalue sign was equaling zero. It's when whatever was in\\nthe absolute value sign is switching from negative\\nsigns to positive signs. So once again, if you\\nshift three to the right, that has to happen at x equals three. So whatever is inside\\nthe absolute value sign has to be equal to zero at\\nx equals three and this, pause this video and\\nreally think about this if it isn't making sense and even as you get more\\nand more familiar with this, I encourage you to try out the numbers. That will give you more,\\ninstead of just memorizing, hey, if I shift to the right, I replace x with x minus\\nthe amount that I shift. Always try out the numbers\\nand try to get an intuition for that why that works. But now, let's start from\\nhere and shift four up and shifting four up is in\\nsome ways a lot more intuitive. So let me do that. Let me shift four up. Alright, so let me move. I'm gonna go up one, two, three and four. I think I got that right. So now I've shifted four up. And just as a reminder\\nof what we've even done, the first part we shifted\\nthree to the right and now we are shifting four up. So now, now we are shifting four up. So before, y equaled zero here but now, y needs to be equal to four. So whatever this was evaluating, do we now have to add four to it? So when we just shifted\\nthree to the right, our equation was y is\\nequal to the absolute value of x minus three but now whatever we were getting before, we now have to add four to it. We're going up in the vertical direction. So we just have to add four. Now, this makes a little bit more sense. If you're shifting in\\nthe vertical direction, if you shift up in the vertical direction, well, you just add a constant\\nby the amount you're shifting. If you shift down in\\nthe vertical direction, well, you would subtract. If we said shift down four, you would subtract four right over here. The less intuitive thing\\nis what we did with x 'cause when you shift to the right, you actually replace your x with x minus the amount that you shifted but once again, try out numbers until it really makes some\\nintuitive sense for you but this is what we would finally get. The equation of this thing right over here is y is equal to the absolute value of x minus three plus four. \"),\n",
       " ('10.1.2',\n",
       "  \"- [Instructor] The graph of y is equal to absolute value of x is reflected across the x-axis and then scaled vertically\\nby a factor of seven. What is the equation of the new graph? So pause the video and see\\nif you can figure that out. Alright, let's work\\nthrough it together now. Now, you might not need\\nto draw it visually but I will just so that\\nwe can all together visualize what is going on. So let's say that's my x-axis and that is my y-axis. y equals the absolute value of x. So for non-negative values of x, y is going to be equal to x. Absolute value of zero is zero. Absolute value of one is one. Absolute value of two is two. So it's gonna look like this. It's gonna have a slope of one and then for negative values, when you take the absolute value, you're gonna take the opposite. You're gonna get the positive. So it's gonna look like this. Let me see if I can draw\\nthat a little bit cleaner. This is a hand drawn\\nsketch so bear with me but hopefully this is familiar. You've seen the graph of y is equal to absolute\\nvalue of x before. Now, let's think about the\\ndifferent transformations. So first, they say is\\nreflected across the x-axis. So for example, if I have some x value right over here, before, I would take\\nthe absolute value of x and I would end up there but now we wanna reflect across the x-axis so we wanna essentially get\\nthe negative of that value associated with that corresponding x and so for example, this x, before, we would get\\nthe absolute value of x but now we wanna flip across the x-axis and we wanna get the negative of it. So in general, what we are doing is we are getting the negative\\nof the absolute value of x. In general, if you're\\nflipping over the x-axis, you're getting the negative. You're scaling the expression\\nor the function by a negative. So this is going to be y\\nis equal to the negative of the absolute value of x. Once again, whatever absolute value of x was giving you before for given x, we now wanna get the negative of it. We now wanna get the negative of it. So that's what reflecting\\nacross the x-axis does for us but then they say scaled\\nvertically by a factor of seven and the way I view that is if\\nyou're scaling it vertically by a factor of seven, whatever y value you got for given x, you now wanna get seven times the y value, seven times the y value for a given x. And so if you think\\nabout that algebraically, well, if I want seven times the y value, I'd have to multiply this thing by seven. So I would get y is\\nequal to negative seven times the absolute value of x and that's essentially\\nwhat they're asking, what is the equation of the new graph, and so that's what it would be. The negative flips us over the x-axis and then the seven scales\\nvertically by a factor of seven but just to understand\\nwhat this would look like, well, you multiply zero times seven, it doesn't change anything but whatever x this is, this was equal to negative x but now we're gonna get\\nto negative seven x. So let's see, two, three,\\nfour, five, six, seven so it'd put it something around that. So our graph is now going to look, is now going to look like this. It's going to be stretched\\nalong the vertical axis. If we were scaling vertically by something that had an\\nabsolute value less than one then it would make the graph less tall. It would make it look, it would make it look wider. Let me make it at least look\\na little bit more symmetric. So it's gonna look something, something like that but the key issue and the reason why I'm\\ndrawing is so you can see that it looks like it's\\nbeing scaled vertically. It's being stretched in\\nthe vertical direction by a factor of seven and the\\nway we do that algebraically is we multiply by seven and the negative here is what\\nflipped us over the x-axis. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Instructor] Function\\nG can be thought of as a stretched or compressed version of F of X is equal to\\nthe absolute value of X. What is the equation for G of X? So you can see F of X is equal to the absolute value of X here in blue, and then G of X, not only does it look\\nstressed or compressed, but it also is flipped over the X axis. So like always, pause this video and see if you can up yourself with the equation for G of X. Alright, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. So there\\'s a couple of\\nways we could do it. We could first try to flip F of X, and then try to stretch or compress it, or we could stretch or compress it first, and then try to flip it. Let\\'s actually, let\\'s flip it first, so let\\'s say that we have a function that looks like this. It\\'s just exactly what F of X is, but flipped over the X axis. So it\\'s just flipped over the X axis, so all the values for any given X, whatever Y you used to get, you\\'re not getting the negative of that. So this graph right over here, this would be the graph. I\\'ll call this, Y is equal to the negative absolute value of X. Whatever the absolute value of X would have gotten you before, you\\'re now going to get the negative of the opposite of it. So this is getting us\\ncloser to our definition of G of X. The key here is how do\\nwe appropriately stretch or squeeze this green function? So let\\'s think about what\\'s happening. On this green function, when X is equal to one, the function itself is\\nequal to negative one, but we want it, if we want\\nit to be the same as G, we want it to be equal to negative four. So it\\'s actually four times the value. For a given X, at least for X equals one, G is giving me something\\nfour times the value that my green function is giving. That\\'s not just true for positive Xs. It\\'s also true for negative Xs. You can see it right over here. When X is equal to negative one, my green function gives me negative one, but G gives me negative four. So it\\'s giving me four times the value. It\\'s giving me four\\ntimes the negative value, so it\\'s going even more negative, so what you can see, to\\ngo from the green to G, you have to multiply this\\nthing right over here by four. So that is what essentially\\nstretches it down, stretches it down in\\nthe vertical direction. So we could say that G of X is equal to, it\\'s not negative absolute value of X, negative four times the\\nabsolute value of X. And you could have done it the other way. You could have said,\\n\"Hey, let\\'s first stretch \"or compress F.\" And say, alright, before\\nwe even flip it over, if we were to unflip G, it would look like this. If we were to unflip G, it would look like this. If were to unflip G, so this thing right over here, this thing looks like four times F of X. We could write this as Y is equal to four times F of X, or you could say Y is equal to four times the absolute value of X, and then we have a negative sign. Whatever positive value\\nyou were getting before, you now get the opposite value, and that would flip it\\nover and get you to G, which is exactly what we already got. '),\n",
       " ('10.1.4',\n",
       "  \"- [Instructor] So we're asked\\nto graph f of x is equal to two times the absolute value\\nof x plus three, plus two. And what they've already graphed for us, this right over here, this is the graph of y is equal\\nto the absolute value of x. So let's do this through a\\nseries of transformations. So the next thing I wanna graph, let's see if we can graph y. Y is equal is to the absolute\\nvalue of x plus three. Now in previous videos\\nwe have talked about it. If you replace your x, with an x plus three, this is going to shift your\\ngraph to the left by three. You could view this as the same thing as y is equal to the absolute\\nvalue of x minus negative three. And whatever you're\\nsubtracting from this x, that is how much you are shifting it. So you're going to shift\\nit three to the left. And we're gonna do that right now and then we're gonna just gonna\\nconfirm that it matches up. That it makes sense. So let's first graph that. Get my ruler tool here. So if we shift three to the left, it's gonna look something like... It's gonna look something like this. So on that... When whatever we have inside the absolute\\nvalue sign is positive, we're going to get\\nessentially, this slope of one. And whenever we have inside the absolute\\nvalue sign is negative, we're gonna have a slope of\\nessentially negative one. So it's going to look... It's going to look like that. And let's confirm whether\\nthis actually makes sense. Below x equals negative three, for x values less than negative three, what we're gonna have here, is this inside of the absolute value sign, is going to be negative and so then we're gonna\\ntake it's opposite value and so that makes sense. That's why you have this\\ndownward line right over here. Now for x is greater than negative three, when you add three to it, you're\\ngonna get a positive value and so that's why you have\\nthis upward sloping line right over here. And at x equals negative three, you have zero inside\\nthe absolute value sign, just as if you didn't shift it, you would have had zero\\ninside the absolute value sign at x equals zero. So hopefully that makes a\\nlittle bit more intuitive sense of why if you replace x, if you replace x with x plus three, and this isn't just true of\\nabsolute value functions, this is true of any function, if you replace x with x plus three, you are going to shift three to the left. All right, now let's keep building. Now let's see if we can graph y is equal to two times the\\nabsolute value of x plus three. So what this is essentially going to do is multiple the slopes by a factor of two. It's going to stretch it\\nvertically by a factor of two. So for x values greater\\nthan negative three, instead of having a slope of one, you're gonna have a slope of two. So let me get my ruler out again and see if I can draw that. So let me put that there. And then, so here instead\\nof a slope of one, I'm gonna have a slope of two. Let me draw that. It's gonna look like\\nthat, right over there. And then instead of having\\na slope of negative one for values less than x\\nequals negative three, I'm gonna have a slope of negative two. Let me draw that right over there. So that is the graph of y is equal to two times the absolute\\nvalue of x plus three. And now to get to the f\\nof x that we care about, we now need to add this two. So now I wanna graph, and\\nwe're in the home stretch, I wanna graph, y is equal to two times the absolute value of\\nx plus three, plus two. Well whatever y value I was getting for this orange function,\\nI now wanna add two to it. So this is just gonna shift\\nit up vertically by two. So instead of... So this is gonna be shifted up by two. This is going to be shifted. Every point is going to shifted up by two or you can think about shifting\\nup the entire graph by two. Here, in the orange function, whatever y value I got\\nfor the black function, I'm gonna have to get two more than that. And so it's going to look... It's going to look like this. So let me see, I'm shifting it up by two. So for x less than negative\\nthree, it'll look like that. And for x greater than negative three, it is going to look like... It is going to look like that. And there you have it. This is the graph of y\\nor f of x is equal to two times the absolute value\\nof x plus three, plus two. And you could've done\\nit in different ways. You could have shifted up two first, then you could have\\nmultiplied by a factor of two, and then you could have shifted, and then, so you could have moved up two first, then you coulda multiplied\\nby a factor of two, then you could've shifted left by three. Or could have multiplied\\nby a factor of two first, shifted up two and then shifted over. So there's multiple, there's three transformations\\ngoing up here. This is an... This is a, let me color them all. So this right over here tells me... This over here says hey, shift left. Shift left by three. This told us, stretch vertically by two. Or essentially multiply the slope by two. Stretch vert by two. And then that last piece, says shift up by two. Shift up by two, which gives us our\\nfinal result for f of x. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] By now we're used to seeing functions defined like h(y)=y^2 or f(x)= to the square root of x. But what we're now going to explore is functions that are\\ndefined piece by piece over different intervals\\nand functions like this you'll sometimes\\nview them as a piecewise, or these types of function definitions they might be called a\\npiecewise function definition. Let's take a look at this\\ngraph right over here. This graph, you can see that the function is constant over this interval, 4x. And then it jumps up\\nin this interval for x, and then it jumps back down\\nfor this interval for x. Let's think about how we would write this using our function notation. If we say that this right\\nover here is the x-axis and this is the y=f(x) axis. Then, let's see, our function\\nf(x) is going to be equal to, there's three different intervals. So let me give myself some space for the three different intervals. Now this first interval\\nis from, not including -9, and I have this open circle here. Not a closed in circle. So not including -9 but\\nx being greater than -9 and all the way up to and including -5. I could write that as -9 is less than x, less than or equal to -5. That's this interval, and what is the value of the function\\nover this interval? Well we see, the value\\nof the function is -9. It's a constant -9 over that interval. It's a little confusing because the value of the function is actually also the value of the lower bound on this\\ninterval right over here. It's very important to look at\\nthis says, -9 is less than x, not less than or equal. If it was less than or\\nequal, then the function would have been defined at\\nx equals -9, but it's not. We have an open circle right over there. But now let's look at the next interval. The next interval is\\nfrom -5 is less than x, which is less than or equal to -1. Over that interval, the\\nfunction is equal to, the function is a constant 6. It jumps up here. Sometimes people call this a\\nstep function, it steps up. It looks like stairs to some degree. Now it's very important\\nhere, that at x equals -5, for it to be defined only one place. Here it's defined by this part. It's only defined over here. So that's why it's\\nimportant that this isn't a -5 is less than or equal to. Because then if you put\\n-5 into the function, this thing would be filled in, and then the function would\\nbe defined both places and that's not cool for a function, it wouldn't be a function anymore. So it's very important that when you input - 5 in here, you know which\\nof these intervals you are in. You can't be in two of these intervals. If you are in two of these intervals, the intervals should\\ngive you the same values so that the function maps, from one input to the same output. Now let's keep going. We have this last\\ninterval where we're going from -1 to 9. >From -1 to +9. And x starts off with -1 less than x, because you have an open\\ncircle right over here and that's good because X equals -1 is defined up here, all the way to x is\\nless than or equal to 9. Over that interval, what is\\nthe value of our function? Well you see, the value of\\nour function is a constant -7. A constant -7 and we're done. We have just constructed a piece by piece definition\\nof this function. Actually, when you see this\\ntype of function notation, it becomes a lot clearer why function notation is useful even. Hopefully you enjoyed that. I always find these piecewise\\nfunctions a lot of fun. \"),\n",
       " ('10.2.2',\n",
       "  \"- [Instructor] Consider the\\nfollowing piecewise function and we say f(t) is equal to and they tell us what it's equal to based on what t is, so if t is less than or equal to -10, we use this case. If t is between -10 and -2, we use this case. And if t is greater than or equal to -2, we use this case. And then they ask us what is the value of f(-10)? So t is going to be equal to -10, so which case do we use? So let's see. If t is less than or equal to -10, we use this top case, right over here and t is equal to -10, that's the one that\\nwe're trying to evaluate. So we wanna use this case right over here. So f(-10) is going to be equal to -10, everywhere we see a t here, we substitute it with a -10. - 10 squared minus 5 times, actually I don't have a denominator there, I don't know why I wrote it so high. So it's gonna be -10\\nsquared minus 5 times -10. So let's see. - 10 squared, that's positive 100 and then negative, or subtracting 5 times -10, this is going to be subtracting -50 or you're going to add 50, so this is going to be equal to 150. f(10) is 150, 'cause we used this case up here, 'cause t is -10. Let's do another one of these examples. So, here we have consider the following\\npiecewise function, alright. What is the value of h(-3)? See when h is -3, which case do we use? We use this case if our x\\nis between negative infinity and zero. And -3 is in between\\nnegative infinity and zero, so we're gonna use this\\ncase right over here. If it was positive three, we would use this case. If it was positive 30, we would use this case. So we're going to use the first case again and so for h(-3), we're gonna take -3 to the third power. So let's see. h(-3) is going to be -3 to the third power which is -27. And we're done. That's h(-3). Because we're using this case, you could almost ignore\\nthese second two cases right over here. Let's do one more example. This one's a little bit different. Below is a graph of the step function g(x) so we can see g(x) right over here. It starts when x equals -9, it's at 3, and then it jumps up, and then it jumps down. Match each expression with its value. So g(-3.0001), so -3.0001, so that's right over here and g of that, we see is equal to 3. So this is going to be\\nequal to 3 right over here. g(3.99999) 3.99999, almost 4, so let's draw a dotted line right here, it's gonna be almost 4, well g(3.99999) is going to be 7. We see that right over there. So that is equal to 7. g(4.00001). So g(4) is still 7, but as soon as we go above 4, we drop down over here, so g(4.00001) is going to be -3. I wanna, actually, let's focus\\non that a little bit more. How did I know that? Well I know that g(4) is 7 and not -3 because we have this dot\\nis circled in up here and it's hollow down here. But as soon as we get\\nany amount larger than 4, then the function drops down to this. So 4.0000, as many, just slightly above 4, the value of our function\\nis going to be -3. Now let's do g(9). So g(9), that's when x is 9 and we go down here. You might be tempted to say it's -3, but you see, at this\\npoint right over here, we have an open circle. So that means that while it's not, you can't say that the\\nfunction is -3 right over there and there's no other place\\nwhere we have a filled-in circle for x equals 9 so the function g actually\\nisn't defined at x equals 9. So I'm gonna put undefined\\nright over there. \"),\n",
       " ('10.2.3',\n",
       "  \"- [Voiceover] So, I\\nhave this somewhat hairy function definition here, and I want to see if we can graph it. And this is a piecewise function. It's defined as a different,\\nessentially different lines. You see this right over here,\\neven with all the decimals and the negative signs,\\nthis is essentially a line. It's defined by this line\\nover this interval for x, this line over this interval of x, and this line over this interval of x. Well, let's see if we can graph it. I encourage you, especially\\nif you have some graph paper, to see if you can graph\\nthis on your own first before I work through it. So, let's think about this first interval. When negative 10 is\\nless than or equal to x, which is less than negative two, then our function is defined\\nby negative 0.125x plus 4.75. So this is going to be a\\nline, a downward sloping line, and the easiest way I can\\nthink about graphing it is let's just plot the endpoints\\nhere, and then draw the line. So, when x is equal to 10, sorry, when x is equal to\\nnegative 10, so we would have negative zero, actually\\nlet me write it this way. Let me do it over here where I do the, so we're going to have negative 0.125 times negative 10 plus 4.75. That is going to be equal to, let's see, the negative times a\\nnegative is a positive, and then 10 times this is\\ngoing to be 1.25 plus 4.75. That is going to be equal to six. So, we're going to have the\\npoint negative 10 comma six. And that point, and it\\nincludes, so x is defined there, it's less than or equal to, and then we go all the\\nway to negative two. So, when x is equal to negative\\ntwo, we have negative 0.125 times negative two plus 4.75 is equal to, see negative times negative is positive, two times this is going to be point, is going to be positive 0.25 plus 4.75. It's going to be equal to positive five. Now, we might be tempted,\\nwe might be tempted, to just circle in this dot over here, but remember, this interval\\ndoes not include negative two. It's up to and including,\\nit's up to negative two, not including. So, I'm gonna put a\\nlittle open circle there, and then I'm gonna draw the line. And then I'm gonna draw the line. I am going to draw my best\\nattempt, my best attempt, at the line. Now, let's do the next interval. The next interval, this one's\\na lot more straightforward. We started x equals negative\\ntwo, when x equals negative two negative two plus seven is,\\nnegative two plus seven is five. So, negative two, so\\nnegative two comma five, so it actually includes\\nthat point right over there. So we're actually able to fill it in, and then when x is negative one, negative one plus seven is\\ngoing to be positive six. Positive six, but we're not\\nincluding x equals negative one up to and including, so it's\\ngoing to be right over here. When x is negative one,\\nwe are approaching, or as x approaches negative\\none, we're approaching negative one plus seven is six. So, that's that interval right over there. And now let's look at this last interval. This last interval,\\nwhen x is negative one, you're going to have, well, this is just going\\nto be positive 12 over 11 'cause we're multiplying\\nit by negative one, plus 54 over 11 which\\nis equal to 66 over 11 which is equal to positive six. So, we're able to fill\\nin that right over there, and then when x is equal to 10, you have negative 120 over 11. I just multiplied this times 10, 12 times 10 is 120, and\\nwe have the negative, plus 54 over 11. So this is the same thing. This is going to be, what is this? This is negative 66\\nover 11, is that right? Let's see, if you, yeah,\\nthat is negative 66 over 11, which is equal to negative six. So when x is equal to 10, our function is equal to negative six. And so this one actually\\ndoesn't have any jumps in it. It could've, but we see,\\nso there we have it. We have graphed this function\\nthat has been defined in a piecewise way. \"),\n",
       " ('10.2.4',\n",
       "  \"I have a piecewise defined function here,\\nand my goal is to figure out its domain and its range. So first let's think about the\\ndomain. And just a bit overview, the domain is\\nthe set of all inputs for which our function is defined. \\nAnd over here, an input variable is x, so to think about, it's the set of all\\nthe values that x can take on, and actually have this function be defined,\\nand actually figure out what f of x is. And when we look at this, we see, okay, if 0 is\\nless than x is less than or equal to 2. We're in this clause, it's x crosses 2 and it is greater than 2.\\nWe follow this clause As we approach 6 but right when we get\\nto 6, we fall into this clause right over here, all the way up to and including 11. \\nBut if we get larger than 11, the function is no longer defined. I don't know which of\\nthese to use. And if we're 0 or less, the function is\\nlonger defined as well. So in order for this to be defined, x has\\nto be greater than 0 or if we say 0 is less than x, and you see that part right over there.\\nAnd x has to be less than or equal to 11. and x has to be less then or equal to 11. It's defined for everything in between. \\nAs we, as we see, once again, as we get to 2, we're here.\\nAs we cross 2, between 2 and 6, we're here, and at 6, from 6 to 11 we're over here. So we're defined for all real\\nnumbers in this interval. So our domain is -- actually let me write this all, all real values, are all real all real values. maybe -- Let me write that way.  All real value such\\nthat, such that, 0 is less than x, is less than\\nor equal to 11. So now think about the range.\\nLet's think about the range of this piecewise\\ndefined function. And that's a set of all values that this\\nfunction can actually take on. and this one is, is maybe deceptively\\nsimple because there're only three values that this function can take on. You can take on, f of x can be equal to\\n1. It can be equal to 5, or it could be equal to negative 7. So the range here, we could say that f of x needs to be a member of, \\nthis is just a fancy mathy symbol, just to say this is a member of the set 1, 5, negative 7. f of x is going to take, is going to take on one of these three\\nvalues. Another way to say it is that f of x is going to be equal 1, 5 or negative 7. This is maybe a little less -- a little -- a less a less mathy way, a less precise way of saying the same thing. But one way\\nor another, f of x can only take on one over these three values. \"),\n",

       "  \"So we have a piecewise linear function\\nright over here for different intervals of x. g of x is defined by a a line or the line changes depending\\nwhat interval of x we're actually in. And so let's think about its domain, and\\nthen we'll think about its range. So the domain of this, this is a review.\\nThe domain is the set of all inputs for which this function is defined, and our input\\nvariable here is x. This is a set of all x values for which\\nthis function is defined. And we see here. Anything, anything negative 6 or\\nlower, our function isn't defined. If it, if x is negative 6 or or lower than that. I don't --\\nit doesn't, it doesn't fall into one of these three intervals. So there is no definition for it. \\nIt doesn't say hey do this in all other cases for x. It is just saying, look, if x falls into one of these three\\nconditions, apply this. And if x doesn't fall into one of those three\\nconditions, well this function g is just not defined. So, to fall into one of these three, you have\\nto be at least greater than negative 6. So this part right over here, the low end\\nof our domain is defined right over there, so we say, we could say, negative 6 is less than x and I'm leaving --\\nso let's write it here. All real numbers -- actually\\nlet me write this way x, I could write it more math-y. I could say x is a member of the real numbers such that, such that negative 6 is less than x. Negative 6 is less than x and I also think about the upper bound.\\nSo as x goes, I just wanna make sure that we fill in all the gaps between x being a greater than negative 6 and\\nx is less than or equal to 6. So let's see. As we go up to and including negative 3,\\nwe're in this clause. As soon as we cross negative 3, we fall into this clause up to 4, but\\nas soon as we get 4, we're in this clause up to and including 6. So x at the high end is said to be less than\\nor equal to 6, less then or equal to 6. Now another way to say this and kind of less math-y notation is x, x can be any real number, any the real number such that, such that negative 6 is less than x is less than or equal to 6. These two\\nstatements are equivalent. So now let's think about\\nthe range of this function. Let's think about the range, and the range\\nis, this is the set of all inputs , oh sorry, this is the set of all\\noutputs that this function can take on, or all the\\nvalues that this function can take on. And to do that, let's just think about\\nas x goes, but x varies or x can be any values in this\\ninterval. What are the different values\\nthat g of x could take on? Let's think about that. g of x is going\\nto be between what and what? g of x is going to be between what and\\nwhat? g of x is going to be between what and\\nwhat? And it might actually, this might be some\\nequal signs there but I'm gonna worry about that in a second. So when does this thing hit its low\\npoint? o this thing hits, hits its low point when x is as small as possible. An x is\\ngoing to be as small as possible when x is approaching negative 6. So if x were equal to negative 6, it can't\\nequal negative 6 herer but if x is equal to negative 6, then this thing over here\\nwould be equal to negative 6 plus 7, would be, would be 1. So if x is greater than negative 6,  g of x is going to be greater than 1, or another way\\nto think about it is if negative 6 is less than x, then 1 is going to be less than g of x. And the reason I said that is if I put negative 6\\ninto this, negative 6 plus 7 is equal to 1. Now this gonna hit a\\nhigh end when it as large as possible. The largest value in this interval that\\nwe can take on is x being equal to negative 3.\\nSo when x is equal to negative 3, negative 3 plus 7 is equal to 4, positive 4. And it can actually take on\\nthat value because this is less than or equal to, so we can actually take on\\nx equals negative 3 in which case g of x actually\\nwill take on positive 4. So, let' do that for each of these. \\nNow here we have 1 minus x, so this is going to take on\\nits smallest value when x is as large as possible. So the largest value x can approach for,\\nit can't quite take on for, but it's going to approach for. So if x, let's see, if we said x was 4,\\nalthough that's not this clause here, 1 minus x, 1 minus 4 is negative 3. So as long as x is less than 4, then negative 3 is going to be less than g of x. I wanna make sure that makes sense\\nto you because it can be little bit confusing because this takes on its minimum value when x is approaching, or it's\\napproaching its minimum value when x is approaching its, when x is\\napproaching its maximum because we're subtracting it. So if you take the upper end, even though\\nthis doesn't actually include 4, but as we approach for, we could say, OK, 1 negative 4 is negative 3 so that's, so g of x\\nis always going to be greater than that, as well it's going to be\\ngoing to be a less than. Well what happens as we approach x being equal to negative 3? So, 1 minus negative 3 is going to be positive 4. So this is going to be positive\\n4 right over here. And these are both less than, not less\\nthan or equal to because these are both less than right\\nover here. And now let's think about this right over here. So 2x minus 11 is gonna hit its maximum value\\nwhen x is as large as possible. So its maximum value's going to be hit\\nwhen x is equal to 6 So 2 times 6 is 12, minus 11.\\nWell that's going to be 1. So its maximum value's going to be 1.\\nIt's actually going to be able to hit because x can be equal to 6. Its minimum value is going to be when x\\nis equal to 4, and actually can be equal to 4. We have this less than or equal sign right over there.\\nSo 2 times 4 is 8, minus 11 is negative 3. So, g of x in this case\\ncan get as low as negative 3 when x is equal to 4. So now let's think about all of, all of the\\nvalues that g of x can take on. So we could say, we could write this a bunch of ways,\\nwe could write g of x is going to be a member of the real\\nnumbers such that -- let's see. What's the lowest\\nvalue g of x can take on? g of x can get as low as negative 3.\\nIt can even be equal to negative 3. This one just has been greater the\\nnegative 3, but here can be greater than or equal to negative 3. \\nSo negative 3 is less than or equal to g of x, and it\\ncan get as high as, it can get as high as Let's see. It's defined all the way to \\n1 and then -- or I shouldn't say it is defined all the way to 1.\\nIt can take on values up to 1 but it can also take on values beyond 1.\\nIt can take on values all the way up to including 4 over here. So it can take on values up to and including 4. So g of x is a member\\nreal numbers such that negative 3 is less than or equal to g of x\\nis less than or equal to 4. So the set of all values\\nthat g of x can take on between, including and including negative 3 and positive 4. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Narrator] Let's get some practice with our exponent properties, especially when we have integer exponents. So, let's think about what\\nfour to the negative three times four to the fifth power is going to be equal to. And I encourage you to pause the video and think about it on your own. Well there's a couple of ways to do this. See look, I'm multiplying two things that have the same base, so this is going to be that base, four. And then I add the exponents. Four to the negative three plus five power which is equal to four\\nto the second power. And that's just a straight\\nforward exponent property, but you can also think about why does that actually make sense. Four to the negative 3 power, that is one over four to the third power, or you could view that as one over four times four times four. And then four to the fifth, that's five fours being\\nmultiplied together. So it's times four times four times four times four times four. And so notice, when you multiply this out, you're going to have five\\nfours in the numerator and three fours in the denominator. And so, three of these in the denominator are going to cancel out with three of these in the numerator. And so you're going to be left with five minus three, or negative three plus five fours. So this four times four is the same thing as four squared. Now let's do one with variables. So let's say that you have A to the negative fourth power times A to the, let's say, A squared. What is that going to be? Well once again, you have the same base, in this case it's A, and so\\nsince I'm multiplying them, you can just add the exponents. So it's going to be A to the\\nnegative four plus two power. Which is equal to A to\\nthe negative two power. And once again, it should make sense. This right over here, that is one over A times A times A times A and then this is times A times A, so that cancels with that,\\nthat cancels with that, and you're still left\\nwith one over A times A, which is the same thing as\\nA to the negative two power. Now, let's do it with some quotients. So, what if I were to ask you, what is 12 to the negative seven divided by 12 to the negative five power? Well, when you're dividing, you subtract exponents if\\nyou have the same base. So, this is going to be equal to 12 to the negative seven minus negative five power. You're subtracting the bottom exponent and so, this is going to\\nbe equal to 12 to the, subtracting a negative is the same thing as adding the positive, twelve to the negative two power. And once again, we just\\nhave to think about, why does this actually make sense? Well, you could actually rewrite this. 12 to the negative seven divided by 12 to the negative five, that's the same thing as\\n12 to the negative seven times 12 to the fifth power. If we take the reciprocal\\nof this right over here, you would make exponent positive and then you would get\\nexactly what we were doing in those previous examples with products. And so, let's just do one more with variables for good measure. Let's say I have X to the\\nnegative twentieth power divided by X to the fifth power. Well once again, we have the same base and we're taking a quotient. So, this is going to be X to\\nthe negative 20 minus five cause we have this one right\\nover here in the denominator. So, this is going to be equal to X to the negative twenty-fifth power. And once again, you could\\nview our original expression as X to the negative twentieth and having an X to the\\nfifth in the denominator dividing by X to the fifth is the same thing as multiplying by X to the negative five. So here you just add the exponents and once again you would get X to the negative twenty-fifth power. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Instructor] Do some example, raising exponents or products of exponents to various powers, especially when we\\'re dealing\\nwith integer exponents. So let\\'s say we have three\\nto the negative eight times seven to the third, and we wanna raise that\\nto the negative two power, and I want you to pause this video and see if you could\\nsimplify this on your own. So the key realization here, there\\'s couple of ways\\nthat you can tackle it, but the key thing to realize is if you have the product of two things, and then you\\'re raising that\\nto some type of a exponent, that is going to be the same thing as raising each of these\\nthings to that exponent, and then taking the product. So this is going to be the same thing as three to the negative eight, and then that to the negative two times seven to the third\\nto the negative two, so I\\'ll do seven to the\\nthird right over here. And if I wanna simplify this, three to the negative\\neight to the negative two, we have the other exponent property that if you\\'re raising to an exponent and then raising that whole\\nthing to another exponent, then you can just multiply the exponents. So this is going to be\\nthree to the negative eight times negative two power. Well, negative eight times negative two is positive 16, so this is gonna be\\nthree to the 16th power right over there, and then this part right over here, seven to the third to the negative two. that\\'s gonna be seven to the three times negative two, which is seven to the\\nnegative sixth power. So that is seven to the negative six, and this would be about as\\nmuch as you could simplify. You could rewrite it different ways. Seven to the negative\\nsix is the same thing as one over seven to the sixth, so you could write it\\nlike three to the 16th. We\\'ll use that same shade of blue, three to the 16th over seven to the sixth, but these two are equivalent, and there\\'s other ways that\\nyou could have tackled this. You could have said that this original thing right over here, this is the same thing as, three to the negative eight is the same thing as one\\nover three to the eighth, so you could have said\\nthis is the same thing as seven to the third over three to the eighth, and then you\\'re raising\\nthat to the negative two, in which case you\\'d raise this\\nnumerator to the negative two and the denominator to negative two, but you would have gotten\\nto the exact same place. Let\\'s do another one of these. So let\\'s say that we have got A to the negative two times\\neight to the seventh power, and we wanna raise all of\\nthat to the second power. Well, like before, I can\\nraise each of these things to the second power, so this is the same thing\\nas A to the negative two to the second power times this thing to the second power. Eight to the seventh to the second power, and then here, negative two\\ntimes two is negative four, so that\\'s A to the negative four times, eight to the seven times two is 14, eight to the 14th power. In other videos, we go into more depth about why this should\\nhopefully make intuitive sense. Here you have eight to the seventh times eight to the seventh. Well, you would then\\nadd the two exponents, and you would get to eight to the 14th, so however many times you\\nhave eight to the seventh, you would just keep adding the exponents, or you would multiply by\\nseven that many times. Hopefully that didn\\'t sound too confusing, but the general idea is if you\\nraise something to exponent and then another exponent, you can multiply those exponents. Let\\'s do one more example where we are dealing with quotients, which that first example could have even been perceived as. So let\\'s say we have two to the negative 10 divided by four squared, and we\\'re gonna raise all of\\nthat to the seventh power. Well, this is equivalent\\nto two to the negative 10 raised to the seventh power over four squared raised\\nto the seventh power, so if you have the\\ndifference of two things and you\\'re raising it to some power, that\\'s the same thing as a numerator raised to that power divided by the denominator\\nraised to that power. Well, what\\'s our numerator going to be? Well, we\\'ve done this drill before. It\\'d be two to the negative\\n10 times seventh power, so this would be equal to two\\nto the negative 70th power, and then in the denominator, four to the second power, then that raised to the seventh power. Well, two times seven is 14, so that\\'s going to be four to the 17th power. Now, we actually could think about simplifying this even more. There\\'s multiple ways that\\nyou could rewrite this, but one thing you could\\ndo is say, \"Hey, look, \"four is a power of two.\" So you could rewrite this as this is equal to two to the\\nnegative 70th power over, instead of writing four to the 17th power, why did I write the 17th power? It should be four to the 14th power. Let me correct that. Instead of writing four to the 14th power, I instead could write, so this is two, get the colors right. This is two to the negative 70th over, instead of writing four, I could write two squared\\nto the 14th power. Four is the same thing as two squared, and so now I can rewrite this whole thing as two to the negative 70th power over, well, two to the second, and then that to the 14th, well, that\\'s two to the 28th power, two to the 28th power. And so can I simplify this even more? Well, this is going to be equal to two to the, if I\\'m taking a quotient\\nwith the same base, I can subtract the exponent. So it\\'s gonna be negative 70. It\\'s going to be negative 70 minus 28th power, minus 28, and so this is going to simply two to the negative 98th power, and that\\'s another way of\\nviewing the same expression. '),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] If you're\\nwatching a movie and someone is attempting to do fancy\\nmathematics on a chalkboard, you'll almost always see a\\nsymbol that looks like this. This radical symbol. And this is used to show the square root and we'll see other\\ntypes of roots as well, but your question is, well, what does this thing actually mean? And now that we know a\\nlittle bit about exponents, we'll see that the square\\nroot symbol or the root symbol or the radical is not\\nso hard to understand. So, let's start with an example. So, we know that three to\\nthe second power is what? Three squared is what? Well, that's the same\\nthing as three times three and that's going to be equal to nine. But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the nine, and we said, well, what times\\nitself is equal to nine? We already know that answer is three, but how could we use a\\nsymbol that tells us that? So, as you can imagine,\\nthat symbol is going to be the radical here. So, we could write the\\nsquare root of nine, and when you look at\\nthis way, you say, okay, what squared is equal to nine? And you would say, well,\\nthis is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, three. And I want you to really look at these two equations right over here, because this is the essence\\nof the square root symbol. If you say the square root of nine, you're saying what times\\nitself is equal to nine? And, well, that's going to be three. And three squared is equal\\nto nine, I can do that again. I can do that many times. I can write four, four\\nsquared, is equal to 16. Well, what's the square\\nroot of 16 going to be? Well, it's going to be equal to four. Let me do it again. Actually, let me start\\nwith the square root. What is the square root of 25 going to be? Well, this is the number that\\ntimes itself is going to be equal to 25 or the number,\\nwhere if I were to square it, I'd get to 25. Well, what number is that, well, that's going to be equal to five. Why, because we know that\\nfive squared is equal to, five squared is equal to 25. Now, I know that there's a nagging feeling that some of you might be having, because if I were to take negative three, and square it, and square\\nit I would also get positive nine, and the same\\nthing if I were to take negative four and I were\\nto square the whole thing, I would also get positive\\n16, or negative five, and if I square that I\\nwould also get positive 25. So, why couldn't this thing\\nright over here, why can't this square root be positive\\nthree or negative three? Well, depending on who you talk to, that's actually a reasonable\\nthing to think about. But when you see a\\nradical symbol like this, people usually call\\nthis the principal root. Principal root. Principal, principal square root. Square root. And another way to think\\nabout it, it's the positive, this is going to be the\\npositive square root. If someone wants the\\nnegative square root of nine, they might say something like this. They might say the negative,\\nlet me scroll up a little bit, they might say something like the negative square root of nine. Well, that's going to be\\nequal to negative three. And what's interesting\\nabout this is, well, if you square both sides\\nof this, of this equation, if you were to square both\\nsides of this equation, what do you get? Well negative, anything negative\\nsquared becomes a positive. And then the square root\\nof nine squared, well, that's just going to be nine. And on the right-hand side,\\nnegative three squared, well, negative three times\\nnegative three is positive nine. So, it all works out. Nine is equal, nine is equal to nine. And so this is an\\ninteresting thing, actually. Let me write this a little\\nbit more algebraically now. If we were to write, if we were to write the principal root of nine is equal to x. This is, there's only one\\npossible x here that satisfies it, because the standard convention, what most mathematicians\\nhave agreed to view this radical symbol as, is that this is a principal square root, this\\nis the positive square root, so there's only one x here. There's only one x that\\nwould satisfy this, and that is x is equal to three. Now, if I were to write x\\nsquared is equal to nine, now, this is slightly different. X equals three definitely satisfies this. This could be x equals\\nthree, but the other thing, the other x that satisfies this is x could also be\\nequal to negative three, 'cause negative three squared\\nis also equal to nine. So, these two things,\\nthese two statements, are almost equivalent,\\nalthough when you're looking at this one, there's two\\nx's that satisfy this one, while there's only one x\\nthat satisfies this one, because this is a positive square root. If people wanted to write\\nsomething equivalent where you would have two\\nx's that could satisfy it, you might see something like this. Plus or minus square root\\nof nine is equal to x, and now x could take on positive\\nthree or negative three. \"),\n",

       "  \"We're asked to find the\\nsquare root of 100. Let me write this down bigger. So the square root is this\\nbig check-looking thing. The square root of 100. When you see it like this,\\nthis means the positive square root. If you're familiar with negative\\nnumbers, you know that there's also a negative\\nsquare root, but when you just see this symbol, that means\\nthe positive square root. So let's think about what\\nthis is saying. This is asking us find the\\nnumber, the positive number, that when I multiply that number\\nby itself, I get 100. So what number when I multiply\\nit by itself do I get 100? Well, let's see, if I multiply\\n9 by itself, that's only going to be 81. If I multiply 10 by itself,\\nthat is 100. So this is equal to-- and let\\nme write it this way. Normally, you could\\nskip this step. But you could write this as\\nthe square root of-- and instead of 100, 100 is the same\\nthing as 10 times 10. And then you know, the square\\nroot of something times itself, that's just going\\nto be that something. This is just equal to 10. So the square root\\nof 100 is 10.

       "  \"- Let's see if we can solve the equation P squared is equal to 0.81. So how could we think about this? Well one thing we could\\ndo is we could say, look if P squared is equal to 0.81, another way of expressing\\nthis is, that well, that means that P is going to be equal\\nto the positive or negative square root of 0.81. Remember if we just wrote\\nthe square root symbol here, that means the principal root, or just the positive square root. But here P could be positive\\nor negative, because if you square it, if you square\\neven a negative number, you're still going to\\nget a positive value. So we could write that P is equal to the plus or minus square root of 0.81, which kind of helps us, it's another way of expressing the same,\\nthe same, equation. But still, what could P be? In your brain, you might\\nimmediately say, well okay, you know if this was P\\nsquared is equal to 81, I kinda know what's going on. Because I know that nine\\ntimes nine is equal to 81. Or we could write that nine\\nsquared is equal to 81, or we could write that nine is equal to the principal root of 81. These are all, I guess,\\nsaying the same truth about the universe, but what about 0.81? Well 0.81 has two digits behind,\\nto the right of the decimal and so if I were to\\nmultiply something that has one digit to the right of\\nthe decimal times itself, I'm gonna have something with two digits to the right of the decimal. And so what happens if I\\ntake, instead of nine squared, what happens if I take 0.9 squared? Let me try that out. Zero, I'm gonna use a different color. So let's say I took 0.9 squared. 0.9 squared, well that's going to be 0.9 times 0.9, which is going to be equal to? Well nine times nine is 81,\\nand I have one, two, numbers to the right of the decimal,\\nso I'm gonna have two numbers to the right of\\nthe decimal in the product. So one, two. So that\\nindeed is equal to 0.81. In fact we could write\\n0.81 as 0.9 squared. So we could write this,\\nwe could write that P is equal to the plus or\\nminus, the square root of, instead of writing 0.81, I could write that as 0.9 squared. In fact I could also write\\nthat as negative 0.9 squared. Cause if you put a negative\\nhere and a negative here, it's still not going to change the value. A negative times a negative\\nis going to be a positive. I could, actually I would\\nhave put a negative there, which would have implied a negative here and a negative there. So either of those are going to be true. But it's going to work out for us because we are taking the\\npositive and negative square root. So this is going to be, P is going to be equal\\nto plus or minus 0.9. Plus or minus 0.9, or we could write it that P is equal to 0.9, or P could be equal to negative 0.9. And you can verify that, you would square either of\\nthese things, you get 0.81. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] We already know a little bit about square roots. For example, if I were to tell you that seven squared is equal to 49, that's equivalent to saying that seven is equal to the square root of 49. The square root essentially unwinds taking the square of something. In fact, we could write it like this. We could write the square root of 49, so this is whatever number times itself is equal to 49. If I multiply that number times itself, if I square it, well I'm going to get 49. And that's going to be\\ntrue for any number, not just 49. If I write the square root of X and if I were to square it, that's going to be equal to X and that's going to be true for any X for which we can evaluate the square root, evaluate the principle root. Now typically and as you advance in math you're going to see that this will change, but typically you say,\\nokay if I'm going to take the square root of something,\\nX has to be non-negative. X has to be non-negative. This is going to change\\nonce we start thinking about imaginary and complex numbers, but typically for the\\nprinciple square root, we assume that whatever's\\nunder the radical, whatever's under here, is\\ngoing to be non-negative because it's hard to square a number at least the numbers that we know about, it's hard to square them\\nand get a negative number. So for this thing to be\\ndefined, for it to make sense, it's typical to say\\nthat, okay we need to put a non-negative number in here. But anyway, the focus of this video is not on the square root, it's\\nreally just to review things so we can start thinking\\nabout the cube root. And as you can imagine,\\nwhere does the whole notion of taking a square of something\\nor a square root come from? Well it comes from the notion of finding the area of a square. If I have a square like this\\nand if this side is seven, well if it's a square, all the\\nsides are going to be seven. And if I wanted to find the area of this, it would be seven times\\nseven or seven squared. That would be the area of this. Or if I were to say, well what is if I have a square, if I have, and that doesn't look\\nlike a perfect square, but you get the idea, all the\\nsides are the same length. If I have a square with area X. If the area here is X, what are the lengths of\\nthe sides going to be? Well it's going to be square root of X. All of the sides are\\ngoing to be the square root of X, so it's going to be the square root\\nof X by the square root of X and this side is going to\\nbe the square root of X as well and that's going to be\\nthe square root of X as well. So that's where the term\\nsquare root comes from, where the square comes from. Now what do you think cube root? Well same idea. If I have a cube. If I have a cube. Let me do my best attempt at\\ndrawing a cube really fast. If I have a cube and a\\ncube, all of it's dimensions have the same length so this\\nis a two, by two, by two cube, what's the volume over here. Well the volume is going to\\nbe two, times two, times two, which is two to the\\nthird power or two cubed. This is two cubed. That's why they use the word cubed because this would be the volume of a cube where each of its sides have length two and this of course is\\ngoing to be equal to eight. But what if we went the other way around? What if we started with the cube? What if we started with this volume? What if we started with a cube's volume and let's say the volume\\nhere is eight cubic units, so volume is equal to eight and we wanted to find\\nthe lengths of the sides. So we wanted to figure out what X is cause that's X, that's X, and that's X. It's a cube so all the\\ndimensions have the same length. Well there's two ways that\\nwe could express this. We could say that X times X times X or X to the third power is equal to eight or we could use the cube root symbol, which is a radical with a\\nlittle three in the right place. Or we could write that X is equal to, it's going to look very\\nsimilar to the square root. This would be the square root of eight, but to make it clear,\\nthey were talking about the cube root of eight, we would write a little three over there. In theory for square root, you could put a little two over here, but that'd be redundant. If there's no number here, people just assume that\\nit's the square root. But if you're figuring out the cube root or sometimes you say the third root, well then you have to say, well you have to put this\\nlittle three right over here in this little notch in the\\nradical symbol right over here. And so this is saying X\\nis going to be some number that if I cube it, I get eight. So with that out of the way, let's do some examples. Let's say that I have... Let's say that I want to calculate the cube root of 27. What's that going to be? Well if say that this is\\ngoing to be equal to X, this is equivalent to\\nsaying that X to the third or that 27 is equal to\\nX to the third power. So what is X going to be? Well X times X times X is equal to 27, well the number I can think of is three, so we would say that X, let\\nme scroll down a little bit, X is equal to three. Now let me ask you a question. Can we write something like... Can we pick a new color? The cube root of, let\\nme write negative 64. I already talked about\\nthat if we're talking the square root, it's fairly typical that hey you put a negative number in there at least until we learn\\nabout imaginary numbers, we don't know what to do with it. But can we do something with this? Well if I cube something,\\ncan I get a negative number? Sure. So if I say this is equal to X, this is the same thing as\\nsaying that negative 64 is equal to X to the third power. Well what could X be? Well what happens if\\nyou take negative four times negative four times negative four? Negative four times four is positive 16, but then times negative\\nfour is negative 64 is equal to negative 64. So what could X be here? Well X could be equal to negative four. X could be equal to negative four. So based on the math that we know so far you actually can take the cube\\nroot of a negative number. And just so you know, you\\ndon't have to stop there. You could take a fourth root and in this case you'd have a four here, a fifth root, a sixth root, a seventh root of numbers and we'll talk about that later in your mathematical career. But most of what you're going to see is actually going to be square root and every now and then you're\\ngoing to see a cube root. Now you might be saying, well hey look, you know, you just knew that\\nthree to the third power is 27, you took the cube root, you get X, is there any simple way to do this? And like you know if i give\\nyou an arbitrary number. If I were to just say, I don't know, if I were to say cube root of 125. And the simple answer is, well the easiest way to\\nactually figure this out is actually just to do a factorization and particular prime\\nfactorization of this thing right over here and then\\nyou would figure it out. So you would say, okay\\nwell 125 is five times 25, which is five times five. Alright, so this is the same\\nthing as the cube root of five to the third power, which of course, is going to be equal to five. If you have a much larger number here, yes, there's no very simple way to compute what a cube root or a fourth root or a fifth root might\\nbe and even square root can get quite difficult. There's no very simple\\nway to just calculate it the way that you might\\nmultiply things or divide it. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Let's\\nsee if we can calculate the fifth root of 32. So, like always, pause the\\nvideo and see if you can figure this out on your own. So, let's just remind\\nourselves what a fifth root is. So, if x is equal to the fifth root of 32, that's the same thing as saying x to the fifth power is equal to 32. So, we have to find some number where, if you take five of them\\nand multiply them together, you'd get 32. So, there is a couple of\\nways to approach this. Especially when you're dealing with these really high order roots here. So, let me rewrite the\\nfifth root of 32 here. One way is you could try to factor 32 and see are there factors\\nthat show up five times? So, 32 you might immediately\\nrecognize is an even number. So, it's gonna be divisible by two. It's two times 16. 16 is two times eight. Eight is two times four. Four is two times two. So, in this case, doing the factoring technique worked out well. 'Cause we see that this is two times two times\\ntwo times two times two or two to the fifth power. You could rewrite this as the fifth root of two to the fifth power, which is, of course,\\ngoing to be equal to two. Two to the fifth power is 32. Now, let's do another one. It's gonna be a little bit harder. Let's say we wanna take\\nthe fifth root of 243. So, now, a much, much larger number. So, there's a couple of ways to do this. One, you could try the factoring. Although, that's gonna be harder now that it's a larger number. Or you could do a little\\nbit of trial and error. Doing higher roots without the aid of some type of calculator or something is a little bit more complicated. So, here, if we wanted to\\ndo the factoring technique. We could say, alright,\\nit's not divisible by two. I like to start with the\\nsmallest possible factor. So, it's not divisible by two. Is it divisible by three? And you might be familiar with the test to see if something is divisible by three. You add up the digits and see if that sum of the digits is divisible by three. So, if I were to take\\ntwo plus four plus three, that is equal to nine. And so it is divisible by three. So, this is going to be\\nequal to three times... Let's see three goes into\\n240 80 times and then one. So, 81 times. And so, 81 is also divisible by three. I have a sense of where this is going now. It's three times 27,\\nwhich is three times nine. Which is three times three. So, using the factoring method, we're able to see that three\\nto the fifth power is 243. So, the fifth root of\\n243 is equal to three. Now, another way that\\nyou could have done it is a little bit of trial and error. We already know.. Well, we know that one to the fifth power is just going to be one. We know that two to the fifth power... We just calculated that. That's 32. Well, we now know what\\nthree to the fifth is. Let's say we're just trying to zoom in on it a little bit. So, let's say, if you wanted to see what four to the fifth is. Well, that would be four times four times four times four times four. So, let's see, this is going to be 16. 16 times four is 64. Times four is 256. And then, that times four... And I just happen to know this. But you might wanna do it by hand. This is 1024. So, if you're taking the cube root of 243, you're saying what to the fifth power... Something to the fifth\\npower is equal to 243. And, if you have a sense that it's going to be an integer solution, if you think it's going to be something like a two or a three, well, then, three is probably\\ngoing to be a good guess here. If the possible answers\\nare gonna be decimals, then it's going to be\\na lot more complicated. But that's another way. Say, hey, maybe I'll try a three. And, if you try out\\nthree, you would get 243. \"),\n",

       "  \"Let's see if we can simplify 5\\ntimes the square root of 117. So 117 doesn't jump out at me as\\nsome type of a perfect square. So let's actually take\\nits prime factorization and see if any of those prime\\nfactors show up more than once. So clearly it's an odd number. It's clearly not divisible by 2. To test whether\\nit's divisible by 3, we can add up all of the digits. And we explain why this works in\\nanother place on Khan Academy. But if you add up all\\nthe digits, you get a 9. And 9 is divisible by 3, so 117\\nis going to be divisible by 3. Now, let's do a\\nlittle aside here to figure out what 117\\ndivided by 3 actually is. So 3 doesn't go into 1. It does go into 11, three times. 3 times 3 is 9. Subtract, you got\\na remainder of 2. Bring down a 7. 3 goes into 27 nine times. 9 times 3 is 27. Subtract, and you're done. It goes in perfectly. So we can factor\\n117 as 3 times 39. Now 39, we can factor as--\\nthat jumps out more at us that that's divisible by 3. That's equivalent to 3 times 13. And then all of these\\nare now prime numbers. So we could say that this\\nthing is the same as 5 times the square root of\\n3 times 3 times 13. And this is going to be the\\nsame thing as-- and we know this from our exponent\\nproperties-- 5 times the square root of 3 times 3\\ntimes the square root of 13. Now, what's the square\\nroot of 3 times 3? Well, that's the\\nsquare root of 9. That's the square\\nroot of 3 squared. Any of those-- well, that's\\njust going to give you 3. So this is just going\\nto simplify to 3. So this whole thing is 5 times\\n3 times the square root of 13. So this part right over\\nhere would give us 15 times the square root of 13. Let's do one more example here. So let's try to simplify 3\\ntimes the square root of 26. I'm actually going\\nto put 26 in yellow, like I did in the\\nprevious problem. Well, 26 is clearly\\nan even number, so it's going to\\nbe divisible by 2. We can rewrite it as 2 times 13. And then we're done. 13 is a prime number. We can't factor this any more. And so 26 doesn't have\\nany perfect squares in it. It's not like we\\ncan factor it out as a factor of\\nsome other numbers and some perfect squares\\nlike we did here. 117 is 13 times 9. It's the product of a\\nperfect square and 13. 26 isn't, so we've simplified\\nthis about as much as we can. We would just leave this as 3\\ntimes the square root of 26. \"),\n",

       "  \"What I want to do in\\nthis video is resimplify this expression, 3 times the\\nprincipal root of 500 times x to the third, and take\\ninto consideration some of the comments that\\nwe got out on YouTube that actually give some\\ninteresting perspective on how you could simplify this. So just as a quick review of\\nwhat we did in the last video, we said that this\\nis the same thing as 3 times the\\nprincipal root of 500. And I'm going to do it a\\nlittle bit different than I did in the last video, just\\nto make it interesting. This is 3 times\\nthe principal root of 500 times the principal\\nroot of x to the third. And 500-- we can\\nrewrite it, because 500 is not a perfect square. We can rewrite 500\\nas 100 times 5. Or even better, we could rewrite\\nthat as 10 squared times 5. 10 squared is the\\nsame thing as 100. So we can rewrite this first\\npart over here as 3 times the principal root\\nof 10 squared times 5 times the principal\\nroot of x squared times x. That's the same thing\\nas x to the third. Now, the one thing I'm\\ngoing to do here-- actually, I won't talk about\\nit just yet, of how we're going to do it\\ndifferently than we did it in the last video. This radical right\\nhere can be rewritten as-- so this is going to\\nbe 3 times the square root, or the principal\\nroot, I should say, of 10 squared times\\nthe square root of 5. If we take the square root\\nof the product of two things, it's the same thing as taking\\nthe square root of each of them and then taking the product. And so then this\\nover here is going to be times the square root\\nof, or the principal root of, x squared times the\\nprincipal root of x. And the principal root\\nof 10 squared is 10. And then what I said\\nin the last video is that the principal\\nroot of x squared is going to be the absolute\\nvalue of x, just in case x itself is a negative number. And so then if you\\nsimplify all of this, you get 3 times\\n10, which is 30-- and I'm just going to\\nswitch the order here-- times the absolute value of x. And then you have\\nthe square root of 5, or the principal root of 5,\\ntimes the principal root of x. And this is just going to be\\nequal to the principal root of 5x. Taking the square\\nroot of something and multiplying that times the\\nsquare root of something else is the same thing as just\\ntaking the square root of 5x. So all of this simplified\\ndown to 30 times the absolute value of x times\\nthe principal root of 5x. And this is what we\\ngot in the last video. And the interesting\\nthing here is, if we assume we're only\\ndealing with real numbers, the domain of x right\\nover here, the x's that will make this\\nexpression defined in the real numbers--\\nthen x has to be greater than or equal to 0. So maybe I could\\nwrite it this way. The domain here is that\\nx is any real number greater than or equal to 0. And the reason\\nwhy I say that is, if you put a negative number\\nin here and you cube it, you're going to get\\nanother negative number. And then at least\\nin the real numbers, you won't get an actual value. You'll get a square root\\nof a negative number here. So if you make this-- if\\nyou assume this right here, we're dealing with\\nthe real numbers. We're not dealing with\\nany complex numbers. When you open it up\\nto complex numbers, then you can expand the\\ndomain more broadly. But if you're dealing\\nwith real numbers, you can say that x is going to\\nbe greater than or equal to 0. And then the absolute\\nvalue of x is just going to be x, because it's not\\ngoing to be a negative number. And so if we're assuming\\nthat the domain of x is-- or if this expression is\\ngoing to be evaluatable, or it's going to have\\na positive number, then this can be written as 30x\\ntimes the square root of 5x. If you had the situation\\nwhere we were dealing with complex\\nnumbers-- and if you don't know what a complex number\\nis, or an imaginary number, don't worry too much about it. But if you were\\ndealing with those, then you would have to keep\\nthe absolute value of x there. Because then this\\nwould be defined for numbers that\\nare less than 0. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Let's get some practice. Simplifying radical expressions\\nthat involve variables. So let's say I have two times the square root of seven x times three times the square root of 14 x squared. Pause the video and see\\nif you can simplify it. Taking any perfect squares out multiplying and taking any perfect squares out of the radical sign. Well, let's first just multiply this thing. So, we can change the order of multiplication. This is going to be the same thing as two times three times the square root of seven x times the square root of 14 x squared. And so this is going to be equal to six times and then the product of two radicals, you can view that as the\\nsquare root of the product. So six times the square root of and I'll actually I'll just leave it like this. Seven times x and then let me actually factor 14. 14 is two times seven times x squared. Actually let me extend my radical sign a little bit. And the reason why I\\ndidn't multiply it out. Obviously we could've\\nmultiplied it in our head. X times x squared is x to the third. And we could've said, seven times 14 is what 98. We could've done that. But when you're trying to factor out perfect squares, it's actually easier if it's in this factored form here. Especially because, from a variable point of view you can view this as a\\nperfect square already. And then 14's not a perfect square, seven isn't a perfect square but seven times seven is. Seven times seven is a perfect square. That is 49 of course. So let's rewrite this a little bit to see what we can do. This is going to be six times and I could write it like this. The square root of let's put all the perfect squares first so seven times seven that is 49 that's those two. X squared 49 x squared and then I could once again separate the two\\nradicals right over here. So whatever else is left. So I've already used the seven,\\nthe seven, the x squared I have a two x left. Times two x. Hopefully you'll appreciate\\nthat these two things are equivalent. I could've put one big radical sign over 49 x squared times two x which would've been exactly\\nwhat you have there, but, if you're taking the\\nradical of the product of things, that's the same thing as the product of the radicals. It's come straight out of\\nour exponent properties. But what's valuable about this is we now see this is six times now we can take the the square root of 49 x squared this is going to seven x square root of 49 is seven square root of x squared is going to be x and then we multiply that times the square root of two x times the square root of two x and so now we're in the home stretch. Six times seven is 42 x times the square root of two x and the key thing to appreciate is I keep using this property that a radical of products or the square root of products is the same thing as a\\nproduct of the square root. So even this step that I did here, if you wanted, you could've\\nhad an intermediary step. You could've said that the\\nsquare root of 49 x squared is the same thing as square root of 49 times the square root of x squared which would get us square\\nroot of 49 is seven square root of x squared is x right over there. Let's do let's do another one of these. So let's say I have square root of two a times the square root of 14 a to the third times the square root of five a. So like always, pause this video and see if you can\\nsimplify this on your own. Multiply them and then take\\nall the perfect squares out of the radical. So let's multiply first. So this is gonna be the same thing as the square root of two times 14 times five. So let me actually just I'm just going to two and five are prime. 14 I can factor it as two times seven so this is gonna be two times, instead of\\n14 I'm going to write two times seven and then times five and then we have a times a to the third times a well actually let me write that as a to the fifth. We have a to the first,\\ntimes a to the third, times a to the first, and the exponents you get a to the fifth. Now, what perfect squares do we have here? Well we already see a perfect square in terms of two times two and then a to the fifth\\nisn't a perfect square if you think of terms of the variable a but you can view that as a\\nperfect square a to the fourth times a. So let's rearrange this a little bit. And so this is going to be equal to the square root of let me put my perfect squares out front. The square root of four, two times two times a to the fourth and then let me put my non perfect squares times I have a seven a five and an a that I haven't used yet so seven times five is 35 so it's 35 a and now just like we said before, we could let me do it we could say hey look, this is the same thing as\\nthe square root of four times the square root of a to the fourth it's using exponent properties and then times the square root of 35 a. Now principle root of\\nfour is positive two. You can view this as\\na positive square root and then square root of a to the fourth the principle root is\\ngoing to be a squared and then we're going to have that times the square root of 35 a and we're done. Let's do one more example and this time, we're going\\nto involve two variables which as we'll see isn't that much more complicating. So let's simplify the square root of 72 x to the third z to the third so the key is can we factor 72 is not a perfect square but is there a perfect\\nsquare somewhere in there? And you immediately see that\\nif you're trying to factor it you get 36 times two and 36 of course is a perfect square. And likewise x to the\\nthird and z to the third are not each perfect squares but they each have an x\\nsquared and z squared in them. So let me rewrite this. This is the same thing This is the same thing as I can write let me put all my\\nperfect squares up front. So I have 36 36 I'm gonna take an x squared out x squared I'm gonna take a z squared out z squared and then we're left with is we took a 36 out so we're left with a two times two and if we took an x squared out of this we're left with just an x x to the third divided by x squared is x two x and then z to the third\\ndivided by z squared is just z and you can verify this multiply this all out. You should be getting you should be getting\\nexactly what we have here. I do that little line on\\nthe z to differentiate so it doesn't look like my twos. 36 times two is 72 x squared times x is x to the third. Z squared times z is z to the third. But now this is pretty\\nstraighforward to factor because let me just I'll do more steps than\\nyou would probably do if you were doing it on your own but that's because the whole point here is to learn. So two x z so that's just using exponent properties. And so everything here\\nis a perfect square. This is going to be the square root of 36 times the square root of x squared times the square root of z squared which is going to be square root of 36 is principle root of 36 is six principle root of x squared is x principle root of z squared is z and we're gonna multiply that times square root of two x z and we are done. \"),\n",

       "  \"In this video, I want to\\nintroduce you to the idea of an exponential function and\\nreally just show you how fast these things can grow. So let's just write an example\\nexponential function here. So let's say we have y is equal\\nto 3 to the x power. Notice, this isn't x to\\nthe third power, this is 3 to the x power. Our independent variable x\\nis the actual exponent. So let's make a table here to\\nsee how quickly this thing grows, and maybe we'll\\ngraph it as well. So let's take some\\nx values here. Let's start with x is\\nequal to negative 4. Then we'll go to negative 3,\\nnegative 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. And let's figure out what our\\ny-values are going to be for each of these x-values. Now, here, y is going to be 3 to\\nthe negative 4 power, which is equal to 1 over 3 to\\nthe fourth power. 3 to the third is 27 times\\n3 again is 81. So this is equal to 1/81. When x is equal to negative\\n3, y is 3. We'll do this in a\\ndifferent color. This color is hard to read. y is 3 to the negative\\n3 power. Well, that's 1 over 3\\nto the third power, which is equal to 1/27. So we're going from a\\nsuper-small number to a less super-small number. And then 3 to the negative\\n2 power is going to be 1/9, right? 1 over 3 squared, and then we\\nhave 3 to the 0 power, which is just equal to 1. So we're getting a little bit\\nlarger, a little bit larger, but you'll see that we\\nare about to explode. Now, we have 3 to\\nthe first power. That's equal to 3. So we have 3 to the second\\npower, right? y is equal to 3 to the second power. That's 9. 3 to the third power, 27. 3 to the fourth power, 81. If we were to put the\\nfifth power, 243. Let's graph this, just\\nto get an idea of how quickly we're exploding. Let me draw my axes here. So that's my x-axis and\\nthat is my y-axis. And let me just do it in\\nincrements of 5, because I really want to get the general\\nshape of the graph here. So let me just draw as straight\\na line as I can. Let's say this is 5, 10, 15. Actually, I won't get\\nto 81 that way. I want to get to 81. Well, that's good enough. Let me draw it a little\\nbit differently than I've drawn it. So let me draw it down here\\nbecause all of these values, you might notice, are positive\\nvalues because I have a positive base. So let me draw it like this. Good enough. And then let's say I have 10,\\n20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. That is 80 right there. That's 10. That's 30. That'll be good for\\napproximation. And then let's say that\\nthis is negative 5. This is positive 5 right here. And actually, let me stretch\\nit out a little bit more. Let's say this is negative 1,\\nnegative 2, negative 3, negative 4. Then we have 1, 2, 3, and 4. So when x is equal to 0, we're\\nequal to 1, right? When x is equal to 0, y is equal\\nto 1, which is right around there. When x is equal to 1, y is equal\\nto 3, which is right around there. When x is equal to 2, y is equal\\nto 9, which is right around there. When x equal to 3, y is\\nequal to 27, which is right around there. When x is equal to 4,\\ny is equal to 81. You see very quickly this\\nis just exploding. If I did 5, we'd go to\\n243, which wouldn't even fit on my screen. When you go to negative 1, we\\nget smaller and smaller. So at negative 1,\\nwe're at 1/9. Eventually, you're not even\\ngoing to see this. It's going to get closer\\nand closer to zero. As this approaches larger and\\nlarger negative numbers, or I guess I should say smaller\\nnegative numbers, so 3 to the negative thousand, 3 to the\\nnegative million, we're getting numbers closer and\\ncloser to zero without actually ever approaching\\nzero. So as we go from negative\\ninfinity, x is equal to negative infinity, we're getting\\nvery close to zero, we're slowly getting our\\nway ourselves away from zero, but then bam! Once we start getting\\ninto the positive numbers, we just explode. We just explode, and we\\nkeep exploding at an ever-increasing rate. So the idea here is just to\\nshow you that exponential functions are really,\\nreally dramatic. Well, you can always construct\\na faster expanding function. For example, you could say y is\\nequal to x to the x, even faster expanding, but out of the\\nones that we deal with in everyday life, this is one of\\nthe fastest. So given that, let's do some word problems\\nthat just give us an appreciation for exponential\\nfunctions. So let's say that someone\\nsends out a chain letter in week 1. In week 1, someone sent a chain\\nletter to 10 people. And the chain letter says you\\nhave to now send this chain letter to 10 more new people,\\nand if you don't, you're going to have bad luck, and your hair\\nis going to fall out, and you'll marry a frog,\\nor whatever else. So all of these people agree and\\nthey go and each send it to 10 people the next week. So in week 2, they go\\nout and each send it to 10 more people. So each of those original 10\\npeople are each sending out 10 more of the letters. So now 100 people have\\nthe letters, right? Each of those 10 sent\\nout 10, so that 100 letters were sent out. 10 were sent. Here, 100 were sent. In week 3, what's\\ngoing to happen? Each of those 100 people who\\ngot this one, they're each going to send out 10, assuming\\nthat everyone is really into chain letters. So 1,000 people are\\ngoing to get it. And so the general pattern\\nhere is, the people who receive it, so in week n where\\nn is the week we're talking about, how many people\\nreceived the letter? In week n, we have 10 to the nth\\npeople receive-- i before e except after c-- the letter. So if I were to ask you, how\\nmany people are getting the letter on the sixth week? How many people are actually\\ngoing to receive that letter? Well, what's 10 to\\nthe sixth power? 10 to the sixth is equal to 1\\nwith six zeroes, which is 1 million people are going to\\nreceive that letter in just 6 weeks, just sending out\\n10 letters each. And obviously, in the real\\nworld, most people chuck these in the basket, so you don't have\\nthis good of a hit rate. But if you did, if every 10\\npeople you sent it to also sent it to 10 people and so on\\nand so forth, by the sixth week, you would have\\na million people. And by the ninth week, you would\\nhave a billion people. And frankly, the week\\nafter that, you would run out of people. I'll see you in the\\nnext video. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] So I have two\\ndifferent xy relationships being described here. And what I would like to do in this video is figure out whether each\\nof these relationships, whether they are either\\nlinear relationships, exponential relationships, or neither. And like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out yourself. So let's look at this first\\nrelationship right over here. And the key way to tell whether\\nwe're dealing with a linear, or exponential, or neither relationship, is think about, okay,\\nfor given change in x, and you see, each time here, we are increasing x by the same amount. So we're increasing x by three. So given that we're increasing\\nx by a constant amount, by three each time, does y\\nincrease by a constant amount? In which case, we would be dealing with a linear relationship. Or is there a constant ratio\\nbetween successive terms when you increase x by a constant amount. In which case, we would be dealing with an exponential relationship. So let's see. Here we're going from\\nnegative two to five. So we are adding seven. When x increases by three,\\ny increases by seven. When x is increasing by three,\\ny increases by seven again. When x increases by three,\\ny increases by seven again. So here, it is clearly\\na linear relationship. Linear relationship. In fact, you can even, relationship, you could even plot this on a line if you assume that these\\nare samples on a line. You could think even about\\nthe slope of that line. For a change in x, for\\na given change in x, the change in y is always constant. When our change in x is three, our change in y is always seven. So this is clearly a linear relationship. Now let's look at this one. Let's see. Looks like our x's are\\nchanging by one each time, so plus one. Now what are y's changing by? Here it changes by two. Then it changes by six. Alright, it's clearly not linear. Then it changes by 18. Clearly not a linear relationship. If this was linear, these\\nwould be the same amount, same delta, same change\\nin y for every time, 'cause we have the same change in x. So let's test to see if it's exponential. If it's an exponential, for each of these constant changes in x's, when we increase x by one every time, our ratio of successive\\ny's should be the same. Or another way to think about it is what are we multiplying y by? So to go from one to three, you multiply, you multiply by three. To go from three to nine,\\nyou multiply be three. To go from nine to 27,\\nyou multiply by three. So in a situation where every time you increase x by a fixed\\namount, in this case one, and the corresponding y's get multiplied by some fixed amount, then you're dealing with an\\nexponential relationship. Exponential. Exponential relationship right over here. \"),\n",

Is W a linear function or\\nan exponential function? So, if W were a linear\\nfunction, that means that every week that goes by, the weight would increase by the same amount. So let's say that every week that went by, the weight increases ... Or, really, they're\\ntalking about mass here. The mass increased by 5 kilograms. Then we'd be dealing\\nwith a linear function. But they're not saying that the weight increases by 5 kilograms. They're saying by 5%. After one week it'll be\\n1.05 times 40 kilograms. After another week it'll\\nbe 1.05 times that, it'll be 5 percent more. After the next week\\nit'll be 1.05 times that. So really, if we really\\nthink about this function, it's going to be 40 kilograms times 1.05 to the t power. We're compounding by 5% every time. We're increasing by a factor of 1.05. Or another way of thinking\\nabout it, by a factor of 105% every week. Because we have that growth by a factor, not just by a constant\\nnumber, that tells us that this is going to be\\nan exponential function. So let's see which if these\\nchoices describe that. This function is linear, no, we don't have to even read that. This function is linear, nope. This function is exponential\\nbecause W increases by a factor of 5 each\\ntime t increases by 1. No, that's not right. We're increasing by 5%. Increasing by 5% means\\nyou're 1.05 times as big as you were before increasing. So it's really this\\nfunction is exponential because W increases by a factor of 1.05 each time t increases by 1. That, right over there,\\nis the right answer. Let's try 1 more of these. Determine whether the quantity described is changing in a linear fashion or an exponential fashion. Fidel has a rare coin worth $550. Each year the coin's\\nvalue increases by 10%. Well, this is just like the last example we saw. We're increasing every year that goes by as we increase by a factor of 1.1. If we grow by 10%, that's\\nincreasing by a factor of 110% or 1.1. So this is definitely exponential. If it was increasing $10 per year, then it would be linear. But here we're increasing by a percentage. Your uncle bought a car\\nfor 130,000 Mexican pesos. Each year the value of the car decreases by 10,000 pesos. So here we're not multiplying by a factor, we're decreasing by a fixed amount. 1 year goes by, we're at 120,000. 2 years goes by we're at 110,000. So this is definitely a linear ... This can be described by a linear model. The number of wild hogs\\nin Arkansas increases by a factor of 3 every 5 years. So a factor of 3 every 5 years.

And I\\'m using, this is an example from\\nthe Khan Academy exercises, and we\\'re really trying to pick between whether a linear model or a linear function\\nmodels this relationship or an exponential model or exponential function will model this relationship. So like always, pause this video, and see if you can figure\\nit out on your own. All right, so now let\\'s\\nthink about this together. So as the time goes by around this, the time variable right over here, we see that we keep\\nincrementing it by two. Go from zero to two, two to four, four to six, so on and so forth. It keeps going up by two. So if this is a linear relationship, given that our change in time is constant, our change in cost should\\nincrease by a constant amount. Doesn\\'t have to be this constant, but it has to be a constant amount. If we were dealing with an\\nexponential relationship, we would multiply by the same amount for a constant change in time. Let\\'s see what\\'s going on here. Let\\'s just first look at the difference between these numbers. To go from 30 to 36.9, you would have to add 6.9. And to go from 36.9 to 44.1, what do you have to add? You have to add 7.2. And now to go from 44.1 to 51.1, you would have to add seven. Now to go to 51.1 to 57.9, you are adding 6.8, 6.8. And then finally, going from 57.9 to 65.1, let\\'s see, this is almost eight, 7.1, this is what, 7.2 we\\'re adding, plus 7.2. So you might say, \"Hey, wait, \"we\\'re not adding the exact\\nsame amount every time.\" But remember, this is intended to be data that you might actually get\\nfrom a real-world situation. And the data that you get\\nfrom a real-world situation will never be exactly a linear model or exactly an exponential model. But every time we add two years, it does look like we\\'re\\ngetting pretty close to adding 7,000 dollars in cost. 6.9 is pretty close to seven. That\\'s pretty close to seven. That is seven. This is pretty close to seven. That\\'s pretty close to seven. So this is looking like\\na linear model to me. You could test whether\\nit\\'s an exponential model. You see, well, what factor\\nam I multiplying each time? But that doesn\\'t seem to be as, this doesn\\'t seem to be\\ngrowing exponentially. It doesn\\'t seem like we\\'re multiplying by the same factor every time. It seems like we\\'re multiplying\\nby a slightly lower factor, as we get to higher cost. So the linear model seems\\nto be a pretty good thing. If I see every time I\\nincrease by two years, I\\'m increasing cost by\\n6.9 or 7.2 or seven. It\\'s pretty close to seven. So it\\'s not exactly the cost, but the model predicts it pretty well. If you were to plot these on a, on a coordinate plane and try to connect the dots, it would look pretty close to a line, or you could draw a line\\nthat gets pretty close to those dots. '),\n",

       "  '- [Instructor] You put\\n$3,800 in a savings account. The bank will provide\\n1.8% interest on the money in the account every year. Another way of saying that, the money in the savings account\\nwill grow by 1.8% per year. Write an expression that\\ndescribes how much money will be in the account in 15 years. So let\\'s just think\\nabout this a little bit. Let\\'s just think about\\nthe starting amount. So in the start, we\\'re\\njust gonna put $3,800. We could view that as year zero. Actually, let me write it that way. So the start is the\\nsame thing as year zero and we\\'re gonna start with $3,800. Now let\\'s think about year one. How much money will we\\nhave after one year? Well, we would have the original\\namount that we put, $3,800, and then we\\'re gonna get the\\namount that we get an interest and they say that the bank\\nwill provide 1.8% interest on the money in the account so it\\'ll be plus 1.8% times $3,800 and we could also write this as a decimal. This is equal to 3,800\\nplus and I\\'ll just write, I\\'ll switch the order\\nof multiplication here, plus 3,800 times 0.018. 1.8% is the same thing\\nas 18,000ths or 1.800ths depending on how you want to pronounce it. And so here you might say, \"Well, there\\'s an interesting\\npotential simplification \"mathematically here.\" I could factor 3,800 out\\nof each of these terms. I have a 3,800 here, I have a 3,800 here so why don\\'t I factor it out? Essentially undistributed. So this is going to be 3,800 times, when you factor it out here, you get a one plus, when you factor it out here, you get 0.018 and so I could just rewrite\\nthis as 3,800 times 1.018. So this is an interesting time to pause. We\\'re not at the full answer yet, how much will we have in 15 years, but we have an interesting expression for how much we have after one year. Notice that if the\\nmoney is growing by 1.8% or another way it was growing by 0.018, that\\'s equivalent to multiplying the amount that we started the year with by one plus the amount that\\nit\\'s growing by or 1.018. And once again, why does\\nthis make intuitive sense? Because at the end of the year, you\\'re going to have the\\noriginal amount that you put, that\\'s what that one really represents, and then plus you\\'re gonna have\\nthe amount that you grew by so you multiply both the sum here times the original amount you put and that\\'s how much you\\'ll\\nhave at the end of year one. What about year two? So year two. Well, we know what we\\'re going\\nto start with in year two. We\\'re gonna start with whatever\\nwe finished year one with. So we\\'re gonna start\\nwith 3,800 times 1.018, but then it\\'s gonna grow\\nby 1.8% or grow by 0.018. And we already said, if you\\'re\\ngonna grow by that amount, that\\'s equivalent to\\nmultiplying it by 1.018. Well, this is the same\\nthing as 3,800 times 1.018 to the second power. I think you see where this is going. Every time we grow by 1.8%, we\\'re gonna multiply by 1.018. And if we\\'re thinking about\\n15 years in the future, we\\'re gonna do that 15 times. So one year in the future, your exponent here is essentially one. Two years, your exponent is two. So year 15, I can just\\ncut to the chase here, so year 15, well that\\'s just going to be, we\\'re going to have the\\noriginal amount that we invested and we are going to grow 1.018 15 times so we\\'re gonna multiply\\nby this amount 15 times to get the final amount.

You\\'ll see if you type\\nthis into a calculator that even though 1.8% per\\nyear does not seem like a lot, over 15 years it actually would amount to a reasonable amount, but this is the expression.

       "  \"- [Voiceover] So let's\\nthink about a function. I'll just give an example. Let's say, h of n is equal to one-fourth times two to the n. So, first of all, you might notice something\\ninteresting here. We have the variable, the\\ninput into our function. It's in the exponent. And a function like this is\\ncalled an exponential function. So this is an exponential. Ex-po-nen-tial. Exponential function, and that's because the variable, the input into our function, is sitting in its definition of what is the output of\\nthat function going to be. The input is in the exponent. I could write another\\nexponential function. I could write, f of, let's say the input is a variable, t, is equal to is equal to five times times three to the t. Once again, this is an exponential function. Now there's a couple of\\ninteresting things to think about in exponential function. In fact, we'll explore many of them, but I'll get a little\\nused to the terminology, so one thing that you might see is a notion of an initial value. In-i-tial Intitial value. And this is essentially\\nthe value of the function when the input is zero. So, for in these cases, the initial value for the function, h, is going to be, h of zero. And when we evaluate that, that's going to be one-fourth times two to the zero. Well, two to the zero power, is just one. So it's equal to one-fourth. So the initial value,\\nat least in this case, it seems to just be that number that sits out here. We have the initial value times some number to this exponent. And we'll come up with\\nthe name for this number. Well let's see if this was\\ntrue over here for, f of t. So, if we look at its intial value, f of zero is going to be five times three to the zero power and, the same thing again. Three to the zero is just one. Five times one is just five. So the initial value is once again, that. So if you have exponential functions of\\nthis form, it makes sense. Your initial value, well if you put a zero\\nin for the exponent, then the number raised to the exponent is just going to be one, and you're just going to be left with that thing that you're\\nmultiplying by that. Hopefully that makes sense, but since you're looking at it, hopefully it does make a little bit. Now, you might be saying, well what do we call this number? What do we call that number there? Or that number there? And that's called the common ratio. The common common ratio. And in my brain, we say well why is it\\ncalled a common ratio? Well, if you thought about\\ninteger inputs into this, especially sequential\\ninteger inputs into it, you would see a pattern. For example, h of, let me do this in that green color, h of zero is equal to, we already\\nestablished one-fourth. Now, what is h of one going to be equal to? It's going to be one-fourth times two to the first power. So it's going to be one-fourth times two. What is h of two going to be equal to? Well, it's going to be one-fourth times two squared, so it's going to be times two times two. Or, we could just view this as this is going to be two times h of one. And actually I should have done this when I wrote this one out, but this we can write as two times h of zero. So notice, if we were to\\ntake the ratio between h of two and h of one, it would be two. If we were to take the ratio between h of one and h of zero, it would be two. That is the common ratio between successive whole number\\ninputs into our function. So, h of I could say h of n plus one over h of n is going to be equal to is going to be equal to actually I can work it out mathematically. One-fourth times two to the n plus one over one-fourth times two to the n. That cancels. Two to the n plus one,\\ndivided by two to the n is just going to be equal to two. That is your common ratio. So for the function h. For the function f, our common ratio is three. If we were to go the other way around, if someone said, hey, I have some function whose initial value, so let's say, I have some function, I'll\\ndo this in a new color, I have some function, g, and we know that its initial initial value is five. And someone were to say its common ratio its common ratio is six, what would this exponential\\nfunction look like? And they're telling you this\\nis an exponential function. Well, g of let's say x is the input, is going to be equal to our initial value, which is five. That's not a negative sign there, Our initial value is five. I'll write equals to make that clear. And then times our common ratio to the x power. So once again, initial value, right over\\nthere, that's the five. And then our common ratio is the six, right over there. So hopefully that gets\\nyou a little bit familiar with some of the parts of an exponential function, why they are called what they are called. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] There are\\n170 deer on a reservation. The deer population is increasing at a rate of 30% per year. Write a function that gives\\nthe deer population P of t on the reservation t years from now. All right, let's think about this. And like always, pause this video, and see if you can work\\nit out on your own. Well, let's think about what P of zero is. P of zero, this is going to be the initial population of deer, the population at time zero. Well, we know that, that's\\ngoing to be the 170 deer that we start on the reservation. Now, let's think about what P of one is. What's going to be the\\npopulation after one year? Well, it's going to be our\\noriginal population, 170, but then it increases at\\na rate of 30% per year. So it's going to be 170\\nplus another 30% of 170. So I could write that as 30% times 170. Or I could write this as 170 plus 0.3 times 170. 30% as a decimal is the same\\nthing as 30/100 or 3/10. Or I could write this as, if I factor out 170, I would get 170 times one plus 0.3, which is the same thing as 170 times 1.03. And this is a really good\\nthing to take a hard look at 'cause you'll see it a lot when we're growing by a certain rate, when we're dealing with what turns out to be\\nexponential functions. If we are growing, well, I almost made a\\nmistake there, it's 1.3. So here you go, 1.3. One plus 0.3 is 1.3. So once again, take a hard\\nlook at this right over here because it's going to be something that you see a lot with\\nexponential functions. When you grow by 30%, that means you keep your\\n100% that you had before, and then you add another 30%. And so you would multiply your\\noriginal quantity by 130%, and 130% is the same thing as 1.3. So if you are growing by 30%, you are growing by 3/10, you would multiply your\\ninitial quantity by 1.3. So let's use that idea to keep going. So what is the population after two years? Well, you would start that second year with the population at\\nthe end of one year. So it's going to be that 170 times 1.3. And then, over that year,\\nyou're going to grow by another 30%. So if you're gonna grow by another 30%, that's equivalent to\\nmultiplying by 1.3 again. Or you could say that this\\nis equal to 170 times 1.3 to the second power. And so I think you see\\nwhere this is going. If we wanted to write a general P of t, so if we just want to\\nwrite a general P of t, it's going to be whatever\\nwe started with, 170, and we're going to multiply that by 1.3 however many times, however\\nmany years have gone by. So to the t power because, for every year, we grow by 30%, which is equivalent mathematically\\nto multiplying by 1.3. So after 100 years, it would be 170 times\\n1.3 to the 100th power. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] The expression\\nfive times two to the T gives the number of leaves in a plant as a function of the number\\nof weeks since it was planted. What does two represent\\nin this expression? So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure it out on your own. All right, so let's look at\\nthe expression right over here. We could write it as defining a function. So we could say leaves\\nas a function of time is equal to five times two to the T power and so we could try this out a little bit. If we say well what is L of zero? That would be T equals zero. That's when we are at zero\\nweeks after it was planted. So this is right when it was planted. Well that's five times two to the zero, which is just two to the zero's just one. So it's equal to five and so when you see an\\nexponential expression or an exponential function like this, that is why this number out here is often referred to\\nas your initial value. Initial. Initial value. And so let's explore\\nthis a little bit more. What is L of one? What happens after one week? Well that's gonna be five\\ntimes two to the first power or five times two. So going from when it was\\nplanted to the first week, we are multiplying by two. The number of leaves doubles. Well what happens after two weeks, the number of leaves after two weeks? Well that's gonna be five\\ntimes two to the second power. Well that's the number that\\nyou had in the first week times two. So it looks like every\\nweek we are doubling, we are multiplying by two and that's why this\\nnumber right over here, which is what the question\\nis about, the two, this is often referred\\nto as the common ratio. Common ratio. Because between any two successive weeks, the ratio between say week\\ntwo and week one is two. Week two is double week one. Week one is double week zero. So let's see which of these choices actually match up to that. There were initially\\ntwo leaves in the plant. Well we know that there weren't\\ntwo leaves on the plant. Our initial value was five. So let me cross that one out. The number of leaves is\\nmultiplied by two each week. Well that's exactly\\nwhat we just described. So I like that choice. Let's look at the last\\none just for good measure. The plant was planted two weeks ago. Well no, they don't tell\\nus anything about that. This is a general expression for T weeks after it was planted. So they're not saying when\\nit was actually planted. So we could rule that out and we feel good about that second choice. \"),\n",

       "  \"We're asked to graph y is\\nequal to 5 to the x-th power. And we'll just do this\\nthe most basic way. We'll just try out\\nsome values for x and see what we get for y. And then we'll plot\\nthose coordinates. So let's try some negative\\nand some positive values. And I'll try to\\ncenter them around 0. So this will be my x values. This will be my y values. Let's start first with something\\nreasonably negative but not too negative. So let's say we start with\\nx is equal to negative 2. Then y is equal to\\n5 to the x power, or 5 to the negative\\n2 power, which we know is the same thing as 1 over 5\\nto the positive 2 power, which is just 1/25. Now let's try another value. What happens when x is\\nequal to negative 1? Then y is 5 to the\\nnegative 1 power, which is the same thing as 1 over 5\\nto the first power, or just 1/5. Now let's think about\\nwhen x is equal to 0. Then y is going to be equal\\nto 5 to the 0-th power, which we know anything\\nto the 0-th power is going to be equal to 1. So this is going\\nto be equal to 1. And then finally,\\nwe have-- well, actually, let's try a\\ncouple of more points here. Let me extend this table\\na little bit further. Let's try out x is equal to 1. Then y is 5 to the first power,\\nwhich is just equal to 5. And let's do one\\nlast value over here. Let's see what happens\\nwhen x is equal to 2. Then y is 5 squared,\\n5 to the second power, which is just equal to 25. And now we can plot it to\\nsee how this actually looks. So let me get some\\ngraph paper going here. My x's go as low as negative\\n2, as high as positive 2. And then my y's go all the way\\nfrom 1/25 all the way to 25. So I have positive\\nvalues over here. So let me draw it like this. So this could be my x-axis. That could be my x-axis. And then let's make\\nthis my y-axis. I'll draw it as neatly as I can. So let's make that my y-axis. And my x values, this\\ncould be negative 2. Actually, make my\\ny-axis keep going. So that's y. This is x. That's a negative 2. That's negative 1. That's 0. That is 1. And that is positive 2. And let's plot the points. x is negative 2. y is 1/25. Actually, let me make\\nthe scale on the y-axis. So let's make this. So we're going to go\\nall the way to 25. So let's say that this is 5. Actually, I have to do it a\\nlittle bit smaller than that, too. So this is going to\\nbe 5, 10, 15, 20. And then 25 would be right where\\nI wrote the y, give or take. So now let's plot them. Negative 2, 1/25. 1 is going to be like there. So 1/25 is going to be really,\\nreally close to the x-axis. That's about 1/25. So that is negative 2, 1/25. It's not going to\\nbe on the x-axis. 1/25 is obviously\\ngreater than 0. It's going to be really,\\nreally, really, really, close. Now let's do this point here\\nin orange, negative 1, 1/5. Negative 1/5-- 1/5 on this\\nscale is still pretty close. It's pretty close. So that right over there\\nis negative 1, 1/5. And now in blue,\\nwe have 0 comma 1. 0 comma 1 is going to\\nbe right about there. If this is 2 and 1/2, that\\nlooks about right for 1. And then we have 1 comma 5. 1 comma 5 puts us\\nright over there. And then finally,\\nwe have 2 comma 25. When x is 2, y is 25. 2 comma 25 puts us\\nright about there. And so I think you see what\\nhappens with this function, with this graph. The further in the\\nnegative direction we go, 5 to ever-increasing\\nnegative powers gets closer and closer\\nto 0, but never quite. So we're leaving 0, getting\\nslightly further, further, further from 0. Right at the y-axis,\\nwe have y equal 1. Right at x is equal to 0,\\nwe have y is equal to 1. And then once x starts\\nincreasing beyond 0, then we start seeing what\\nthe exponential is good at, which is just this\\nvery rapid increase. Some people would call it\\nan exponential increase, which is obviously the\\ncase right over here. So then if I just\\nkeep this curve going, you see it's just going\\non this sometimes called a hockey stick. It just keeps on\\ngoing up like this at a super fast rate,\\never-increasing rate. So you could keep going\\nforever to the left, and you'd get closer and\\ncloser and closer to 0 without quite getting to 0. So 5 to the negative\\nbillionth power is still not going\\nto get you to 0, but it's going to get you\\npretty darn close to 0. But obviously, if you go to 5\\nto the positive billionth power, you're going to get\\nto a super huge number because this thing is just\\ngoing to keep skyrocketing up like that. So let me just draw\\nthe whole curve, just to make sure you see it. Over here, I'm not actually on\\n0, although the way I drew it, it might look like that. I'm slightly above 0. I'm increasing above that,\\nincreasing above that. And once I get into the\\npositive x's, then I start really,\\nreally shooting up. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Alright,\\nwe are asked to choose the graph of the function. And the function is f(x) is equal to two, times three to the x and we have three choices here. So, pause this video and\\nsee if you can determine which of these three graphs actually is the graph of f(x). Let's work through this together. So, whenever I have a function like this, which is an exponential function, because I'm taking some number and I'm multiplying it by some\\nother number to some power. So, that tells me that I'm\\ndealing with an exponential. So, I like to think about two things. What happens when x equals zero? What is the value of our function? Well, when you just look at this function, this would be two,\\ntimes three to the zero. Which is equal to, three\\nto the zero is one. It's equal to two. So, one way to think about it. In the graph of y is equal to f(x), when x is equal to\\nzero, y is equal to two. Or another way to think about it is this value in exponential function, sometimes called the initial value, if you were thinking of the x-axis. Instead of the x-axis, you're\\nthinking about the time axis or the t-axis. That's why it's sometimes\\ncalled the initial value. But the y-intercept is\\ngonna be described by that when you have a function of this form. And you saw it right over there, f(0). Three to the zero's one. You're just left with the two. So, which of these have\\na y-intercept of two? Well, here, the\\ny-intercept looks like one. Here, the y-intercept looks like three. Here, the y-intercept is two. So, just through elimination\\nthrough that alone, we can feel pretty good that this third graph is probably the choice. But let's keep on analyzing it to feel even better about it. And so, we have the skills for really any exponential function\\nthat we might run into. Well, the other thing to realize. This number, three, is often referred to as a common ratio. And that's because every\\ntime you increase x by one, you're gonna be taking\\nthree to a one higher power. Or you're essentially gonna\\nbe multiplying by three again. So, for example, f(1) is going to be equal to two, times three to the one. Two, times three to the\\none or two times three, which is equal to six. So, from f(0) to f(1), you essentially have to multiply by three. And you keep multiplying by three. f(2) you're gonna multiply by three again. It's gonna be two, times three squared, which is equal to 18. And so, once again, when\\nI increased my x by one, I'm multiplying the value\\nof my function by three. So, let's just see which of these do this. This one we said has\\nthe wrong y-intercept, but, as we go from x equals\\nzero to x equals one, we are going from one to three. And then, we are going from three till looks like pretty close to nine. So, it does look like this does have a common ratio of three. It just does have a different y-intercept than the function we care about. This looks like the graph f(x) is equal to just\\none, times 3 to the x. Here, we're starting at three. And then, when x equals one, it looks like we are doubling\\nevery time x increases by one. So, this looks like the\\ngraph of y is equal to... I have what we could\\ncall our initial value, our y-intercept, three. And, if we're doubling every\\ntime, we increase by one. Three, times two to the x. That's this graph here. As I said, this first graph looks like y is equal to one, times three to the x. We are tripling every time. One, times three to the x. Or we could just say y is\\nequal to three to the x. Now, this one here better work, 'cause we already picked\\nit as our solution. So, let's see if that's actually the case. So, as we increase by one,\\nwe should multiply by three. So, two times three is, indeed, six. And then, when you\\nincrease by another one, we should go to 18. And that's kind of off the charts here, but it does seem reasonable to see that we are multiplying by three every time. And you could also go the other way. If you're going down by one, you should be dividing by three. So, two divided by three, this does look pretty close to 2/3. So, we should feel very\\ngood about our third choice. \"),\n",

Company B is offering\\n$500 for the first month and will double their payment each month. For which monthly payment\\nwill Company B's payment first exceed Company A's payment? So pause this video and\\ntry to work that out. All right, let's work this out together. So let me set up a little bit of a table. So this is going to be, the first column I'm gonna have is month. The first column is month. The second column is how much\\nCompany A is going to pay. And then third column,\\nlet's think about how much Company B is going to pay. Well, they tell us a few things. They say Company A is offering\\n$10,000 for the first month. So in month one, Company\\nA is offering $10,000, we'll assume, well, I'll\\njust write the dollars there. And then Company B is offering\\n$500 for the first month. $500 for the first month. But then they tell us\\nCompany A is offering, will increase the amount,\\neach month by $5,000. So month two will be 5,000\\nmore, we'll get to $15,000. Month three we'll get to $20,000. Four, we'll get to $25,000. Five, I think you get the\\npoint, we'll get to $30,000. Six, we'll get to $35,000. Seven, we'll get to $40,000. Let me scroll down a little bit. Month eight, I'll stop there. Month eight, we will get to $45,000. Let me extend these lines a little bit. Now let's think about what's\\ngonna happen with Company B. Company B is offering\\n500 for the first month, but will double their payment each month. So the second month is\\ngonna be double that. So that's going to be $1,000. Then we're gonna double\\nthat again, $2,000. Then we're gonna double\\nthat again, $4,000. Double that again, $16,000. Double that again, $32,000. Double that, oh, I skipped one. I went from 4,000 to 16,000. 4,000, $8,000. Then we double it again, $16,000. Again, 32, I sound like\\nmy two year old again. All right, $32,000. Then we get to $64,000. And at that point something\\ninteresting happens. It's actually good that I\\nwent to the eighth month because every month\\nbefore the eighth month, Company A's payment was higher\\nuntil that eighth month. In that eighth month, Company\\nB is going to pay more. So first we can just\\nanswer their question. For which monthly payment\\nwill Company B's payment first exceed Company A's payment? Well, that is month eight, month eight. And there's a broader\\nlesson going on here. You might recognize that the\\nrate at which Company A's payment is increasing is linear. Every month it increases\\nby the same amount. So plus 5,000, plus 5,000. It increases by 5,000 the same amount. Company B is increasing exponentially. It's increasing by the\\nsame factor every time, so we're multiplying by\\nthe same value every time. We're multiplying by two,\\nwe're multiplying by two, multiplying by two. And so there's actually a\\nvery interesting thing here that you can actually\\nmake the general statement that an exponential function\\nwill, we'll want something that is exponentially\\nincreasing, will eventually always surpass something\\nthat is linearly increasing. And it doesn't matter what\\nthe initial situation is, and it also doesn't even matter that rate of exponential increase,\\nit will eventually always pass up something that's\\nincreasing linearly. And you can think about\\nthat visually if you like. If I were to draw a visual\\nfunction, a linear function, so this is x-axis, this is the y-axis, a linear function, well, this is gonna be described by a line. So it could look something like this. A linear function is always\\ngonna be a line of some slope. And an exponential function,\\neven though it might start a little bit slower, it's eventually going to pass up the linear function. And this is going to be the\\ncase even if the linear function has a pretty high slope or a\\npretty high starting point, if it's something like that,\\nand even if the exponential function is starting pretty\\nslow, it will eventually, and even if it's compounding\\nor growing relatively slow but exponentially, you know\\nif it's going 2% or 3%, it still will eventually\\npass up the linear function which is pretty cool. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Narrator] What we're\\ngoing to do in this video is quickly review exponential growth and then use that as our platform to introduce ourselves\\nto exponential decay. So let's review exponential growth. Let's say we have something that, and I'll do this on a table here. Just gonna make that straight. So let's say this is\\nour x and this is our y. Now let's say when x is\\nzero, y is equal to three. And every time we increase\\nx by 1, we double y. So y is gonna go from three to six. If x increases by one\\nagain, so we go to two, we're gonna double y again. And so six times two is 12. This right over here\\nis exponential growth. And you could even go for negative x's. When x is negative one, well,\\nif we're going back one in x, we would divide by two. So this is going to be 3/2. 3/2. And notice if you go from\\nnegative one to zero, you once again, you\\nkeep multiplying by two and this will keep on happening. And you can describe\\nthis with an equation. You could say that y is equal to, and sometimes people might\\ncall this your y intercept or your initial value, is equal to three,\\nessentially what happens when x equals zero, is\\nequal to three times our common ratio, and our common ratio is, well, what are we\\nmultiplying by every time we increase x by one? So three times our\\ncommon ratio two, to the to the x, to the x power. And you can verify that. Pick any of these. When x is equal to two,\\nit's gonna be three times two squared, which\\nis three times four, which is indeed equal to 12. And we can see that on a graph. So let me draw a quick\\ngraph right over here. So, I'm having trouble\\ndrawing a straight line. All right, there we go. And let's see. We could go, and they're gonna be on a slightly different\\nscale, my x and y axes. So this is x axis, y axis. And we go from negative one to one to two. Let's see, we're going\\nall the way up to 12. So let's see, this is three, six, nine, and let's say this is 12. We could just plot these points here. When x is negative one, y is 3/2. So looks like that, then at y equals zero, x is, when x is zero, y is three. When x equals one, y has doubled. It's now at six. When x is equal to two, y is 12. And you will see this tell-tale curve. And so there's a couple\\nof key features that we've Well, we've already talked\\nabout several of them, but if you go to increasingly\\nnegative x values, you will asymptote towards the x axis. It'll never quite get to zero as you get to more and\\nmore negative values, but it'll definitely approach it. And as you get to more\\nand more positive values, it just kind of skyrockets up. We always, we've talked\\nabout in previous videos how this will pass up any linear function or any linear graph eventually. Now, let's compare that\\nto exponential decay. Exponential, exponential decay. An easy way to think about it, instead of growing every\\ntime you're increasing x, you're going to shrink\\nby a certain amount. You are going to decay. So let's set up another table here with x and y values. That was really a very, this is supposed to, when I press shift, it should create a straight\\nline but my computer, I've been eating next to my computer. Maybe there's crumbs in\\nthe keyboard or something. (laughs) All right. So here we go. We have x and we have y. And so let's start with, let's say we start in the same place. So when x is zero, y is 3. But instead of doubling every\\ntime we increase x by one, let's go by half every\\ntime we increase x by one. So when x is equal to\\none, we're gonna multiply by 1/2, and so we're gonna get to 3/2. Then when x is equal to two,\\nwe'll multiply by 1/2 again and so we're going to get to 3/4 and so on and so forth. And if we were to go to negative values, when x is equal to negative one, well, to go, if we're going\\nbackwards in x by one, we would divide by 1/2, and so we would get to six. Or going from negative one to zero, as we increase x by one,\\nonce again, we're multiplying we're multiplying by 1/2. And so how would we write\\nthis as an equation? I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can write\\nit in a similar way. Well, it's gonna look something like this. It's gonna be y is equal to You have your, you could\\nhave your y intercept here, the value of y when x is equal to zero, so it's three times, what's\\nour common ratio now? Well, every time we increase x by one, we're multiplying by 1/2 so 1/2 and we're gonna\\nraise that to the x power. And so notice, these\\nare both exponentials. We have some, you could say\\ny intercept or initial value, it is being multiplied\\nby some common ratio to the power x. Some common ratio to the power x. But notice when you're\\ngrowing our common ratio and it actually turns\\nout to be a general idea, when you're growing, your common ratio, the absolute value of your common ratio is going to be greater than one. Let me write it down. So the absolute value of two in this case is greater than one. But when you're shrinking,\\nthe absolute value of it is less than one. And that makes sense, because if the, if you have something\\nwhere the absolute value is less than one, like 1/2 or 3/4 or 0.9, every time you multiply it, you're gonna get a lower\\nand lower and lower value. And you could actually\\nsee that in a graph. Let's graph the same\\ninformation right over here. And let me do it in a different color. I'll do it in a blue color. So when x is equal to negative one, y is equal to six. When x is equal to zero,\\ny is equal to three. When x is equal to one, y is equal to 3/2. When x is equal to two, y is equal to 3/4. And so on and so forth. And notice, because our common\\nratios are the reciprocal of each other, that these two graphs look\\nlike they've been flipped over, they look like they've\\nbeen flipped horizontally or flipped over the y axis. They're symmetric around that y axis. And what you will see in exponential decay is that things will get smaller\\nand smaller and smaller, but they'll never quite\\nexactly get to zero. It'll approach zero. It'll asymptote towards the x axis as x becomes more and more positive. Just as for exponential growth, if x becomes more and more negative, we asymptote towards the x axis. So that's the introduction. I'd use a very specific\\nexample, but in general, if you have an equation of\\nthe form y is equal to A times some common ratio to the x power We could write it like\\nthat, just to make it a little bit clearer. There's a bunch of different\\nways that we could write it. This is going to be exponential growth, so if the absolute value\\nof r is greater than one, then we're dealing with growth, because every time you multiply, every time you increase\\nx, you're multiplying by more and more r's is\\none way to think about it. And if the absolute value\\nof r is less than one, you're dealing with decay. You're shrinking as x increases. And I'll let you think\\nabout what happens when, what happens when r is equal to one? What are we dealing\\nwith in that situation? And it's a bit of a trick question, because it's actually quite, oh, I'll just tell you. If r is equal to one, well\\nthen, this thing right over here is always going to be equal to one and you boil down to just\\nthe constant equation, y is equal to A, so this would\\njust be a horizontal line. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceoer] This is from the graph basic exponential functions on Khan Academy. They asked us graph the\\nfollowing exponential function. And they give us the function, h of x is equal to 27 times 1/3 to the x. So our initial value is 27\\nand 1/3 is our common ratio. It's written in a\\nstandard exponential form. And it gives us some graphing tool where we can define these two points and we can also define a horizontal asymptote to construct our function. And these three things\\nare enough to define to graph an exponential if we know that it is an exponential function. So let's think about it a little bit. So the easiest thing\\nthat I could think of is, well, let's think about its initial value. Its initial value is going\\nto be x equal to zero. X equal zeros, 1/3 to the\\nzero power is just one and so you're just left with\\n27 times one or just 27. That's what we call this number here when you've written in this form. You call this the initial value. So when x is equal to zero, h of x is equal to 27. Now we're graphing y=h(x). So now let's graph another point. So let's think about it a little bit. When x is equal to one, when x is equal to one, what is h of x? It's gonna be 1/3 to the first power which is just 1/3. And so 1/3 times 27 is gonna be nine. So when x is one, h of one is nine. And we can verify. And now let's just think about, let's think about the asymptote. So what's gonna happen here when x becomes really, really, really, really,\\nreally, really, really big? If I take 1/3 to like a\\nreally large exponent to, say to the 10th power\\nor to the 100th power or to the 1000th power, this\\nthing right over here is going to start approaching\\nzero as x becomes much, much, much, much larger. And so something that is\\napproaching zero times 27, well, that's going to\\napproach zero as well. So we're gonna have a\\nhorizontal asymptote at zero. And you can verify that this works for more than just a two\\npoints we talk about. When x is equal to, this is\\ntelling us that the graph, y equals h of x goes to\\nthe point two comma three. So h of two should be equal to three. And you can verify that\\nthat is indeed the case. If x is two, 1/3 squared is nine. Oh sorry, 1/3 squared is 1/9 times 27 is three. And we see that right over here. When x is two, h of two is three. So I feel pretty good about that. Let's do another one of this. So graph the following\\nexponential function. So same logic. When x is zero, the g\\nof zero is just gonna boiled out to that initial value. And so you scroll down. Initial value is negative 30. And so let's think about\\nwhen x is equal to one. When x is equal to one, two to\\nthe first power is just two. And so two times negative\\n30 is negative 60. So when x is equal to one, the value of the graph is negative 60. Now let's think about this asymptote over that, it should sit. So let's think about what\\nhappens when x becomes really, really, really, really,\\nreally, really negative. So when x is really negative, so two to the negative one power is 1/2. Two to the negative two is 1/4. Two to the negative three is 1/8. As it gets larger and larger negative or higher magnitude negative values or in other words, as x becomes more and more and more negative, two to that power is\\ngoing to approach zero. And so negative 30 times\\nsomething approaching zero is going to approach zero. So this asymptote is in the right place, a horizontal asymptote as x\\napproaches negative infinity. As we move further and\\nfurther to the left, the value of a function\\nis going to approach zero. Now we can see it kind of\\napproaches zero from below. We can see they approaches below because we already looked\\nat the initial value and we used that common ratio\\nto find one other point. Hopefully, you found that interesting. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We are told\\na phone sells for $600 and loses 25% of its value per year. Write a function that gives\\nthe phone's value, V of t, so value as a function of\\ntime, t years after it is sold. So pause this video, and have a go at that before we work through it together. All right, so let's just\\nthink about it a little bit. And I could even set up a table to think about what is going on. So this is t, and this\\nis the value of our phone as a function of t. So it sells for $600. At time t equals zero, what is V of zero? Well it's going to be equal to $600. That's what it sells for\\nat time t equals zero. Now at t equals one,\\nwhat's going to happen? Well it says that the phone loses 25% of its value per year. Another way to rewrite that\\nit loses 25% of its value per year is that it retains, it retains, 100% minus 25% of its value per year, or it retains 75% of its value per year, per year. So how much is it going to\\nbe worth after one year? Well it's going to be worth $600, $600 times 75%. Now what about year two? Well it's going to be worth\\nwhat it was in year one times 75% again. So it's going to be $600\\ntimes 75% times 75%. And so you could write\\nthat as times 75% squared. And I think you see a pattern. In general, if we have gone,\\nlet's just call it t years, well then the value of our phone, if we're saying it in dollars,\\nis just going to be $600 times, and I could write it as a decimal, 0.75, instead of 75%, to the t power. So V of t is going to be equal to 600 times 0.75 to the t power, and we're done. Let's do another example. So here, we are told that\\na biologist has a sample of 6,000 cells. The biologist introduces\\na virus that kills 1/3 of the cells every week. Write a function that gives\\nthe number of cells remaining, which would be C of t, the\\ncells as a function of time, in the sample t weeks after\\nthe virus is introduced. So again, pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, so I'll set\\nup another table again. So this is time, it's in weeks, and this is the number of cells, C. We could say it's a function of time. So time t equals zero, when\\nzero weeks have gone by, we have 6,000 cells. That's pretty clear. Now after one week, how\\nmany cells do we have? What's C of one? Well it says that the virus kills 1/3 of the cells every week,\\nwhich is another way of saying that 2/3 of the cells are able to live for the next week. And so after one week, we're\\ngoing to have 6,000 times 2/3. And then after two weeks,\\nor another week goes by, we're gonna have 2/3 of\\nthe number that we had after one week. So we're gonna have 6,000\\ntimes 2/3 times 2/3, or we could just write\\nthat as 2/3 squared. So once again, you are likely\\nseeing the pattern here. We are going to, at time t\\nequals zero, we have 6,000, and then we're going to multiply by 2/3 however many weeks have gone by. So the cells as a function\\nof the weeks of t, which is in weeks, is going\\nto be our original amount, and then however many weeks have gone by, we're going to multiply\\nby 2/3 that many times, so times 2/3 to the t power. And we're done. \"),\n",

Well, the fact that it's\\nan exponential function, we know that its formula is going to be of the form g(t) is equal to our initial value which we could call A, times our common ratio\\nwhich we could call r, to the t power. It's going to have that form. And they tell us what\\nthe initial value is. It's -2. So this right over here is -2. And we know that the common ratio is 1/7. So this is 1/7. So let me just write it\\nagain a little bit neater. g(t) is going to be equal to our initial value, -2, times times our common ratio, 1/7, to the t power. And hopefully this makes sense. Initial value is this number. Well, if t is equal to 0, then 1/7 to the zero power is 1. And so g(0), you could do that at time as being equal to zero if your t is time, would be equal to -2. So that would be our initial value. And then if you think about it, every time you increase t by one, you're going to mulitply by 1/7 again. And so, the ratio between successive terms is going to be 1/7. And so that's why we call that the common ratio. Hopefully, you found that interesting. \"),\n",

       "  \"Consider the following table\\nof values for a linear function f of x is equal to mx plus b\\nand an exponential function g of x is equal to a\\ntimes r to the x. Write the equation\\nfor each function. And so they give us,\\nfor each x-value, what f of x is and\\nwhat g of x is. And we need to figure out the\\nequation for each function and type them in over here. So I copy and\\npasted this problem on my little scratchpad. So let's first think\\nabout the linear function. And to figure out the\\nequation of a line or a linear function\\nright over here, you really just need two points. And I always like to use the\\nsituation when x equals 0 because that makes\\nit very clear what the y-intercept is going to be. So, for example, we\\ncan say that f of 0 is going to be equal\\nto m times 0 plus b. Or this is just going\\nto be equal to b. And they tell us that\\nf of 0 is equal to 5. b is equal to 5. So we immediately know\\nthat this b right over here is equal to 5. Now, we just have\\nto figure out the m. We have to figure out\\nthe slope of this line. So just as a little bit\\nof a refresher on slope, the slope of this line is\\ngoing to be our change in y-- or our change in our function\\nI guess we could say, if we say that this\\ny is equal to f of x-- over our change in x. And actually, let me\\nwrite it that way. We could write\\nthis as our change in our function\\nover our change in x if you want to look\\nat it that way. So let's look at\\nthis first change in x when x goes from 0 to 1. So we finish at 1. We started at 0. And f of x finishes\\nat 7 and started at 5. So when x is 1, f of x is 7. When x is 0, f of x is 5. And we get a change\\nin our function of 2 when x changes by 1. So our m is equal to 2. And you see that. When x increases by 1, our\\nfunction increases by 2. So now we know the\\nequation for f of x. f of x is going to be equal\\nto 2 times 2x plus b, or 5. So we figured out\\nwhat f of x is. Now we need to figure\\nout what g of x is. So g of x is an\\nexponential function. And there's really two things\\nthat we need to figure out. We need to figure\\nout what a is, and we need to figure out what r is. And let me just rewrite that. So we know that g of x--\\nmaybe I'll do it down here. g of x is equal to a\\ntimes r to the x power. And if we know what g of 0 is,\\nthat's a pretty useful thing. Because r to the 0th\\npower, regardless of what r is-- or\\nI guess we could assume that r is not equal to 0. People can debate what\\n0 to the 0 power is. But if r is any\\nnon-zero number, we know that if you raise it\\nto the 0 power, you get 1. And so that\\nessentially gives us a. So let's just write that down. g of 0 is a times r to\\nthe 0 power, which is just going to be equal\\nto a times 1 or a. And they tell us what g of\\n0 is. g of 0 is equal to 3. So we know that a is equal to 3. So so far, we know that our g\\nof x can be written as 3 times r to the x power. So now we can just use any\\none of the other values they gave us to solve for r. For example, they tell us\\nthat g of 1 is equal to 2. So let's write\\nthat down. g of 1, which would be 3 times r to\\nthe first power, or just 3-- let me just write it. It could be 3 times\\nr to the first power, or we could just write\\nthat as 3 times r. They tell us that g\\nof 1 is equal to 2. So we get 3 times\\nr is equal to 2. Or we get that r\\nis equal to 2/3. Divide both sides of\\nthis equation by 3. So r is 2/3. And we're done. g of x is equal to 3 times 2/3. Actually, let me just\\nwrite it this way. 3 times 2/3 to the x power. You could write it that way\\nif you want, any which way. So 3 times 2/3 to the x power,\\nand f of x is 2x plus 5. So let's actually\\njust type that in. So f of x is 2x plus 5. And we can verify that that's\\nthe expression that we want. And g of x is 3 times 2\\nover 3 to the x power. And let me just verify that\\nthat's what I did there. I have a short memory. All right. Yeah, that looks right. All right. Let's check our answer. And we got it right. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] The graphs of\\nthe linear function f of x is equal to mx plus b and the exponential function g of x is equal to a times r to the x where r is greater than zero pass through the points\\nnegative one comma nine, so this is negative one\\ncomma nine right over here, and one comma one. Both graphs are given below. So this very clearly\\nis the linear function. It is a line right over here. And this right over here is\\nthe exponential function, so right over here. And given the fact that\\nthis exponential function keeps decreasing as x gets\\nlarger and larger and larger is a pretty good hint that\\nour r right over here, they tell us that r is greater than zero, but it's a pretty good hint that r is going to be\\nbetween zero and one. The fact that g of x keeps approaching, it's getting closer and\\ncloser and closer to zero as x increases. But let's use the data they're giving us, the two points of intersection, to figure out what the equations\\nof these two functions are. So first we can tackle\\nthe linear function. So f of x is equal to mx plus b. So they give us two points. We could use those points\\nfirst to figure out the slope. So our m, our m right over\\nhere, that's our slope. That's our change in y over change in x. The rate and change of the vertical axis with respect to the horizontal axis. So let's see, between those two points, what is our change in x? Our change in x, we're going from x equals\\nnegative one to x equals one. X equals one. So we could think of it\\nas we're finishing at one. We started at negative one. So one minus negative one,\\nour change in x is two. We see that right over there. And what about our change in y? Well, we start at nine. Let me do this in maybe\\nanother color here. We start at nine, and we end up at one. So we end up at one. We started at nine. One minus nine is negative eight. And just to be clear,\\nwhen x is one, y is one. When x is negative one, y is nine. Another way to think about it, the way I drew it right over here, we're finishing at x\\nequals one, y equals one. We started at x equals\\nnegative one, y equals nine, and so we just took the differences. We get negative eight over two, which is equal to negative four. Which is equal to negative four. And so now we can write that f of x is equal to negative four, negative four, that's our slope, times x. Negative four times x plus b. And you can see that\\nslope right over here. Every time you increase your... Every time you increase your x by one. I gotta be careful here,\\nI got a little bit. Every time you increase your x by one, you're decreasing your y. And here on the x axis,\\nwe're marking off every half. So every time you increase your x by one, you are decreasing your y. You are decreasing your y by four there, so that makes sense that\\nthe slope is negative four. So now let's think about what b is. So to figure out b, we could\\nuse either one of these points to figure out, given an x, what f of x is, and then we can solve for by. Let's try one, 'cause one\\nis a nice, simple number. So we could write f of one, which would be negative\\nfour times one plus b. And they tell us that f of\\none is one, is equal to one. And so this part right over here, we could write that as negative\\nfour plus b is equal to one, and then we could add four to\\nboth sides of this equation, and then we get b is equal to five. So we get f of x is equal\\nto negative 4x plus five. Now, does that make sense that the y-intercept here is five? Well, you see that right over here. By inspection, you could\\nhave guessed, actually, that the y-intercept here is five, but now we've solved it. Maybe this was 5.00001 or something, but now we know for sure\\nit's negative 4x plus five. Or another way you could've said it, if the slope is negative four, if this right over here is nine, you increase one in the x direction, you're gonna decrease\\nfour in the y direction, and that will get you\\nto y is equal to five, so that is the y-intercept. But either way, we have figured\\nout the linear function. Now let's figure out the\\nexponential function. So here we could just use the two points to figure out these two unknowns. So, for example, let's\\ntry this first point. So g of negative one, which if we look at this right over here, would be a times r to the negative one. They tell us that g of negative one is going to be equal to nine. G of negative one is equal to nine. And so we could write this a\\ntimes r to the negative one. That's the same thing as\\na over r is equal to nine, or we could multiply both sides by r, and we could say a is equal to 9r. Now let's use this other point. This other point, they tell us. They tell us that g of one, which would be the same thing as a times r to the first\\npower or just a times r, that that is equal to one,\\nor a times r is equal to one. So how can we use this\\ninformation right here, a is equal to 9r and a\\ntimes r is equal to one, to solve for a and r? Well, I have a little system here. It is a non-linear system,\\nbut it's a pretty simple one. We could just take this a and substitute it in\\nright over here for a, and so we would get 9r for a. This first constraint tells\\nus a must be equal to 9r. So 9r, instead of writing\\nan a here, I'll write 9r, times r is equal to one. Or we could write, let me\\nscroll down a little bit. We could write 9r squared is equal to one. Divide both sides by nine. R squared is equal to one over nine. And now to figure out r, you might wanna take the\\npositive and negative square root of both sides, but they tell\\nus that r is greater than zero, so we can just take the\\nprincipal root of both sides and we get r is equal to 1/3. And then we could substitute this back into either one of these other\\ntwo to figure out what a is. We know that a is equal to nine times r. So nine times 1/3, a is equal to three. So our exponential function\\ncould be written as g of x is equal to a, which is\\nthree, times r, which is 1/3, 1/3 to the x power. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Let's say\\nthat we have an exponential function, h of n, and since it's an exponential function it's going to be in the\\nform a times r to the n, where a is our initial value and r is our common ratio, and we're going to assume\\nthat r is greater than zero. And they've given us some\\ninformation on h of n. We know that when n is equal to 2, h of 2 is 144, that h of 4 is 324, that h of 6 is 729. So, based on the information here, let's see if we can actually figure out what a and r are going to be. And like always, pause the\\nvideo and try to give it a go. All right, now let's do this together. So I'm going to focus on r first. The common ratio and if we had successive n's. If we had h of 3, then\\nwe could just find the ratio between h of 3 and h of 2 and r would just come out of that, or if the ratio between h of 4 and h of 3, we could solve explicitly for r, but we can get pretty close to that. We can just find the ratio between h of 4 and h of 2. So, h of 4, the ratio between h of 4 and h of 2 is going to be equal to, well, we know h of 4 is 324, and h of 2 is 144, and we could simplify this a little bit. Let's see, if we, if we simplify this, we would get, they're both divisible by 2. If we divide them both by 2, this one in the numerator, 324 divided by 2 is 162. 144 divided by 2 is 72. Let's see, we can divide by 2 again. 81 over 36. Divide by 2, actually, no, we can't\\ndivide by 2 anymore, but we can divide by 9 now, so 81 divided by 9 is 9, and 36 divided by 9 is 4. So this thing can be rewritten as 9/4, but we could also rewrite this ratio by using, using this form of an\\nexponential function, so we could also say that\\nthis is going to be equal to, h of 4 is going to be a times r. Now n is 4, so r to the 4th power, and h of 2 is going to be\\na times r to the 2nd power. A times r to the 2nd power, and this simplifies nicely, a divided by a, cancels to just 1, and r to the 4th divided by r-squared, well that's going to be\\nr to the 4 minus 2 power, or r, it's going to be r to the 2nd power, it's going to be r-squared, and so we have a nice\\nlittle equation set up. R-squared needs to be equal to 9/4. So let me write that down. R-squared is equal to 9/4, and r needs to be greater than zero, so we could just say r is\\ngoing to be the principal root of 9/4, which is equal to 3/2. So we were able to figure out r. So now how do we figure out, how do we figure out a? Well, there's a couple of ways to do it. You can think about a is\\ngoing to be what h of zero is equal to, so we could do, I guess we could call it a tabular method, where, let me set up a little table here. So, a little table, so if this is n and this is h of n, so n is zero, we don't know what h of zero is just yet, it's going to be a. We don't know what h of 1 is yet. We do know that h of 2 is 144. And we do know, since\\nthe common ratio is 3/2, if we take h of 1 and\\nwe multiply it by 3/2, we're going to get h of 2, and if we take h of zero\\nand multiply it by 3/2, we're going to get h of 1. So, h of 1 is going to\\nbe 144 divided by 3/2. So let's write that down. H of 1 is equal to 144 divided by 3/2, which is going to be 144, 144 times 2 over 3, and let's see, 144 divided by 3 is going to be equal to, is it, let's see, one 3 goes into, I'll just do this by hand, my brain doesn't work that well while I'm making videos. 3 goes into 14 four times, 4 times 3 is 12, subtract, so it's going to be, I see, it's going to be 48. 3 goes into 24 eight times. 8 times 3 is 24, you have no remainder, so, this is going to be 48 times 2, which is going to be equal to 96 so this is going to be 96, and so if we want to figure out h of zero, we just divide by 3/2 again, so, h of zero is 96 divided by 3/2 which is equal to 96 times 2 over 3. 96 divided by 3, let's see, it's going to be 32, so this is going to be 32 times, did I do that right? Yup, 32 times 2 which is equal to 64. 64. And so, just like that,\\nwe've figured out that a is equal to 64, and r, and r is equal to 3/2. So we can write h of n, we can say that h of n is equal to 64, is equal to 64 times 3/2, times 3/2, our common ratio, to the nth power. Now, there's another way that\\nwe could have tackled this instead of this tabular method. We could have just solved for a now, since we know r. We know, for example, we know for example that h of 2 which is going to be equal to a times, we know what our common ratio is, it's 3/2 to the 2nd power, is going to be equal to 144. And so, we could say a times 9 over 4 is equal to 144, and so we can multiply both\\nsides times the reciprocal of 9 over 4, so we multiply both sides times 4 over 9, times 4 over 9, and that cancels with that, that cancels with that, and we are left with a is equal to, well let's see, 144 divided by 9 is going to be, is going to be, I want\\nto say it's equal to 16? Is that right? I think that is right. Yup, and then 16 times 4, so this is going to be 16 and 1, 16 times 4 is 64, which is exactly what we got before, and so this actually, this method, now that I look at it, is actually a good bit easier, but they're equivalent, and I like this one because\\nyou get to see the common ratio in action, and you get\\nto see that the initial value is the initial value. It is h of zero, but either way, once you figure out r, and you know one of the h of, you know what the function is at a value, you can solve for a, and frankly, if you\\nknew a and you knew what the function was for a given n, you could likewise solve for r. So hopefully you enjoyed that. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] So we have the graph of an exponential function here,\\nand the function is m of x. And what I want to do\\nis figure out what is m of six going to be equal to? And like always, pause the video, and see if you can work it out. Well, as I mentioned, this\\nis an exponential function, so m is going to take the form. Let me write it this way. M of x is going to take the form a times r to the xth power, where a is our initial power,\\nand r is our common ratio. Well the initial value is\\npretty straightforward. It's just going to be what m of zero is. So a is going to be equal to m of zero, and we can just look at this graph. When x is equal to zero, the\\nfunction is equal to nine. So it's equal to nine, and now we need to figure out our common ratio. So let me set up a little\\nbit of a table here, just to help us with this. So let me draw some straight lines. And so this is x and m of x. We already know that when x is zero, m of x is equal to nine. We also know when x is, let's see. When x is one, when x\\nis one, m of x is three. M of x is three. So when we increase our x by one, what happened to our m of x? Well, what did we have to multiply it by? Well, to go from nine to three, you multiplied by 1/3. So that's going to be our common ratio. And in fact, if we wanted to care what m of two is going to be, we\\nwould multiply by 1/3 again. And m of two should be equal to one, and we see that right over here. M of two is, indeed, equal to one. So our common ratio, our common ratio right over here is equal to 1/3. So m of x, we can write it as, m of x is going to be equal to\\nour initial value, a, which we already figured it out, as a is, a is equal to nine, so\\nit's going to be nine, times our common ratio,\\ntimes our common ratio, 1/3 to the xth power. So I was able to figure out\\nthe formula for our definition for m of x, but that's not what I wanted. I just wanted to figure out\\nwhat m of six is going to be. So we can write down that m of six, m of six is going to be nine times one over three to the sixth power. Let's see, that is going to be equal to, that's the same thing as nine times, well one to the six is just one. That's just going to be one to the six, which is just one, over\\nthree to the sixth power. Now what is three to the sixth power? In fact, I can even simplify\\nthis a little bit more. I can recognize that\\nnine is three squared, so I could say this is going to be three squared over three to the sixth. Three squared over three to the sixth, and then, I could tackle\\nthis a couple of ways. I could just divide the\\nnumerator into the denominator by three squared, in\\nwhich case, I would get one over three to the fourth power. Or another way to think\\nabout it, this should be the same thing as three\\nto the two minus sixth power, which is the same thing as three\\nto the negative four power, which is, of course, the same thing as one over three to the fourth. So what's three to the fourth? So three squared is nine. Three to the third is 27. Three to the fourth is 81. So this is going to be\\nequal to one over 81. M of six is equal to one over 81. We could also, we could've done that if we kept going by our table. M of three, multiply it by 1/3, is going to be 1/3. M of four, multiply by 1/3 again, is going to be 1/9. Then we could, m of five is going to be 1/27, and m of six is going to be 181st. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] So we have a\\ngraph here of the function f of x, and I'm telling\\nyou right now that f of x is going to be an exponential function. It looks like one, but\\nit's even nicer when someone tells you that. And our goal in this video is\\nto figure out at what x value, so when does f of x? At what x value is f of x going to be equal to negative 1/25. And you might be tempted to\\njust eyeball it over here, but when f of x is\\nnegative 1/25, that's like right below the x-axis. If I try to eyeball it, it\\nwould be very difficult. It's very difficult to\\ntell what value that is. It might be at three, it might be at four. I am not sure. Well, I don't want to just\\neyeball it, just guess it. Instead, I'm gonna\\nactually find an expression that defines f of x because they've given us some information here. And then I can just solve\\nfor x, so let's do that. Well, since we know that f of\\nx is an exponential function, we know it's going to take the form f of x is equal to our initial value a times our common ratio r to the xth power. Well, the initial value\\nis straightforward enough. That's going to be the value\\nthat the function takes on when x is equal to zero. And you can even see it\\nhere, if x is equal to zero, the r to the x would just be one. And so f of zero will just be equal to a. And so what is f of zero? Well, when x is equal to zero, which essentially we're saying, where does it intersect the y-axis? We see f of zero is negative 25. So a is going to be negative 25. When x is zero, the r\\nto the x is just one. So f of zero is going to be negative 25. We see that right over there. Now to figure out the common ratio, there's a couple of ways\\nyou could think about it. The common ratio is the ratio between two successive values\\nthat are separated by one. What do I mean by that? Well, you could view\\nit as the ratio between f of one and f of zero. That's going to be the common ratio. Or the ratio between f of two and f of one. That is going to be the common ratio. Well, lucky for us, we know\\nf of zero is negative 25. And we know that f of one,\\nwhen x is equal to one, y, or f of x, or f of one\\nis equal to negative five. And so just like that\\nwe're able to figure out that our common ratio r is\\nnegative five over negative 25, which is the same thing as 1/5. Divide a negative by a\\nnegative, you get a positive. So you get a five over 25, which is 1/5. We can write an expression\\nthat defines f of x. f of x is going to be equal to negative 25 times 1/5 to the x power. And so let's go back to our question. When is this going to be\\nequal to negative 1/25? So when is this equal to negative 1/25? Well, let's just set\\nthem equal to each other. There's a siren outside. I don't know if you hear it. I'll power through. So let's see at what x\\nvalue does this expression equal negative 1/25? Let's see, we can multiply. Well, actually, we want to solve for x. So let's see, let's divide\\nboth sides by negative 25. And so we are going to get 1/5 to the xth power is equal to, if we divide\\nboth sides by negative 25, this negative 25 is gonna go away. And on the right-hand\\nside, we're going to have, divide a negative by a negative\\nis going to be positive. It's going to be 1/625. And 1/5 to the xth power. This is the same thing\\nas one to the xth power over five to the xth power is equal to 1/625. Well, one to the xth power is just going to be equal to one. It doesn't matter that we have this to the xth power over here. I thought I was erasing\\nthat with a black color. There you go, that's a black\\ncolor right over there. So we can see that five to the xth power needs to be equal to 625. So let me write that over here. Whoops, didn't change my color. Five to the xth power needs to be equal to 625. Now the best way I could\\nthink of doing this is let's just think\\nabout our powers of five. So five to the first power is five. Five squared is 25. Five to the third is 125. Five to the fourth, we'll\\nmultiply that by five, you're going to get 625. So x is going to be 4 cause five to the fourth power is 625. So we can now say that f of four is equal to negative 1/25. And once again, you can verify that. You can verify that right over here. 1/5 to the fourth power is gonna be 1/625. Negative 25 over positive 625\\nis going to be negative 1/25. So hopefully that clears\\nthings up a little bit. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Sarah Swift\\ngot a speeding ticket on her way home from work. If she pays her fine now there\\nwill be no added penalty. If she delays her payment then\\na penalty will be assessed for the number of months, t, that she delays paying her fine. Her total fine, F, in euros, is indicated in the table below. These numbers represent an exponential, an exponential function. So they give us the number of months that the payment is delayed and then the amount of fine. And this is essentially data points from an exponential function. Just to remind ourselves\\nwhat an exponential function would look like, this tells us that our fine as our function of the months delayed is going to be equal to some number times some common ratio to the t power. This telling us this exponential function is essentially telling\\nus that our function is going to have this\\nform right over here. So let's see if we can\\nanswer their questions. So the first question is\\nwhat is the common ratio of consecutive values of F? So the reason why r right over here is called the common ratio is it's the ratio that\\nif you look at any two, say if you were to increment t by one the ratio of that to F of t, that ratio should be consistent for any t. So let me give you an example here. The ratio of F of two to F of one should be equal to the ratio\\nof F of three to F of two, which should be the same\\nas the ratio of F of four to F of three. Or in general terms the\\nratio of F of t plus one to the ratio of F of t should be equal to all of these things. That would be the common ratio. So let's see what that is. If we just look at the form, if we just look at this right over here. So what's the ratio of\\nF of two to F of one? 450 divided by 300, well that's 1.5. That's 1.5. 675 divided by 450, that's 1.5. 1,012.5 divided by 675, that's 1.5. So the common ratio in all\\nof these situations is 1.5. So the common ratio over here is 1.5. And another way, and just to to make it clear\\nwhy this r right over here is called the common ratio, is let's just do this general form. So F of t plus one, well that's\\njust going to be a times r to the t plus one power, and F of t is a times r to the t power. So what is this going to be? This is going to be... Let's see, this is going to be\\nr to the t plus one minus t, which is just going to be\\nequal to r to the first power, which is just equal to r. So this variable, r, is going to be equal to this common ratio. So whether we figured out\\nthat the common ratio is 1.5, that tells us that our function\\nis going to be of the form F of t is equal to a times,\\ninstead of writing an r there we now know that r is 1.5 to the t power. 1.5 to the t power. Write a formula for this function. Well we've almost done that, but we haven't figured out what a is. And to figure out what a is\\nwe could just substitute. We know what F of one is. When t is equal to one, F is equal to 300, and so we should be able\\nto use that information to solve for a. We could have used any of these\\ndata points to solve for a, but let's do that. F of one is equal to a times\\n1.5 to the first power, or a times 1.5, and that\\nis going to be equal to, they tell us that F of\\none is equal to 300. And so another way of writing this is we could say 1.5\\ntimes a is equal to 300. Divide both sides by 1.5 and we get a is equal to 200. And so our function, our\\nformula for our function, is, let me write it in black so we can see it. It's going to be 200, that's our a, times 1.5 to the t power. Now another way... Well actually let's just\\nthink about the next question. What is the fine in euros\\nfor Sarah's speeding ticket if she pays it on time? So paying it on time, that\\nimplies that t is equal to zero. Or another way of thinking about it, we need to figure out her\\nfine for t equals zero. So we need to figure out F of zero. So what's F of zero? It's 200 times 1.5 to the zero power. 1.5 to the zero power is one, so that's just going to\\nbe equal to 200 euro. Now another way of thinking\\nabout it is, well look, let's look at the common ratio. To go from 675 to 450 you're essentially dividing\\nby the common ratio. To go from 450 to 300, you're\\ndividing by the common ratio. So then to go from t\\nequals one to t equals zero you would divide by the common ratio again and you would get to 200. Or another way of thinking about it is to go to successive\\nvalues, or successive months, every time we are multiplying\\nby the common ratio. Every time we are multiplying, we are multiplying by the common ratio. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] The number\\nof branches of an oak tree and a birch tree since\\n1950 are represented by the following tables. So for the oak tree we\\nsee when time equals zero has 34 branches. After three years it has 46 branches, so on and so forth. And in the birch tree\\nthey give us similar data. At the beginning has eight branches. In 10 years has 33 branches\\nand they give us all of that. What I want to think about in this video is how should we model these? If we want to model these with functions and the choices we'll give ourselves, there are other options, but the choices we'll give\\nourselves in this video are linear, and linear versus exponential functions. Which of these are going to be better for modeling this data? So let's first look at the oak tree. A key to realization is,\\nwhenever I have a fixed increase in time, so each of these steps, this is plus three years. So it's a fixed increase in time. What happens to my number of branches? Is it going to be a fixed change, or roughly a fixed change in which case a linear model might be good, or is it going to be a\\nchange that's dependent on where we were? So what am I talking about? So 34 to 46, that is plus 12. 46 to 59 is plus 13. 59 to 70 is plus 11. 70 to 82 is plus 12. So at first you mention,\\nwell this isn't exactly a fixed change. These numbers they seem to\\naverage right around 12, but when you're looking at real world data you're never gonna get\\nsomething that is exact. The models are just going\\nto give us a good fit. Are going to give us a good approximation of the behavior of the\\nnumber of branches over time. For me, this is pretty close\\nto a constant 12 branches a year. So I would construct a linear model here. I would say here branches as a function of time. Let me be clear, this\\nisn't 12 branches per year, this is 12 branches every three years. This is 13 branches over three years. This was 11 branches over three years. We're going to average 12\\nbranches over three years. So the number of branches we have, we're gonna start at 34 branches and then minus. If we have 12 branches every three years, that's four branches every, or I should say plus. Four branches every year. And you could test this out. B of zero is gonna give us 34 branches. B of 12. Let's just really test out\\nthe extreme part of the model. B of 12 is going to be 34 plus 48, which is equal to 82. So this model works quite well. It's gonna have a couple of places where it's not exactly fitting the data, but it fits it quite, quite well. This is the linear model. So this one is linear. We also got the birch tree. So time equals zero, so\\nfixed change in time. Alright, so we have a fixed change in time every time we are moving\\ninto the future, a decade. Let's see, our change in branches. We go from eight to 33. So what is that? That is plus 25 branches. Then we go from 33 to 128. Well that's way more than 25 branches. That's going to be what? Five less than 100. So that's gonna be plus 95 branches. So this clearly is not a linear model. And so let's think in terms\\nof an exponential model. How much do we have to\\nmultiply to go from... Did I do that right? 128 minus, yeah, if it was 133 then it would be 100 and it's five less than that, okay. So now let's think about it in terms of an exponential model. In terms of an exponential model what do we have to multiply for each step? So if we have a constant step in time, what do we multiply for how much we increase our branches? So if we go to eight to 33, it's gonna be approximately four. It's gonna be a little bit more than four. 33 to 128, well that's gonna be a\\nlittle bit less than four, but it's approximately four. 33 times four would be\\n132, so we're close. 128 to 512, that's exactly four, right? That's exactly 120 times four is 480 plus 32, yup, that is exactly four. So times four. And so it looks like we\\nkeep multiplying by four every 10 years that go by. So one way to think about it is we could say here, BFT, the branches of T, our initial condition,\\nour initial state is eight and now we could say our\\ncommon factor is four. But if we want T to be in years, well every 10 years we\\nmultiply by a factor of four. So T has to go to 10 before we increase the exponent to one, or has to go to 20 until\\nthis exponent becomes two. So eight times four to the T over 10 power seems like a pretty good model. And you could even verify\\nthis for yourself if you like. Try out what B of 30 is going to be. B of 30 would be eight times four. 30 divided by 10 to the third power and what is that going to be? That's going to be four\\nto the third is 64. 64. Eight times 64 is, it's 480 plus 32. It is 512. So once again, this exponential model for this data does a pretty good job. \"),\n",

So we have time in minutes and then we have the\\ncorresponding temperature at different times in minutes. Which model for C of t, the temperature of the glass of water t minutes after it's served, best fits the data? So pause the video and see which of these\\nmodels best fit the data. Alright, now let's work\\nthrough this together. So in order for it, we see these choices. Some of these choices\\nare exponential models. Some of these are linear models. In order for a linear model\\nto be a good description, when you have a fixed change in time, you should have a fixed\\nchange in temperature. If you're dealing with\\nan exponential model, then as you have a fixed change in time, you should be changing by the same factor so the amount you change from say minute one to minute two or from minute two to minute three, it's not going to be the exact same amount but it should be the same\\nfactor of where you started. So let's think about this. So here, our change in time is two minutes. What is the absolute\\nchange in temperature? So our absolute change in temperature is negative what, 15.7. Negative 15.7 and what if we viewed\\nit as a multiplication? So what do multiply 80 by to get 64.3? Well, I can get a calculator out for that. So 64.3 divided by 80 is equal to 0.8 I'll just say approximately .8 So we could multiply by .0.8 This is going to be approximate. So to get from 80 to 64.3 I could either subtract by 15.7 if I'm dealing with a linear model or I can multiply by 0.8 Now if I increase my time again by two, I'm going from minute two to minute four, so Delta t is equal to two, the absolute change here is what? This is going to be not 12. This is going to be, my brain isn't functioning optimally. This was 64.7 then this would be 12 but it's four less than that so it's 11.6. Negative 11.6 but if you look at it as\\nmultiplying it by a factor, what would you have to\\nmultiply by approximately? Let's get the calculator back out. So if I said 52.7 divided by 64.3. Divided by 64.3 is equal to, that's about .82. So times 0.82. So just by looking at this, I can keep going but it looks like for our\\ngive and change in time, my absolute change in the number is not even close to being the same. If this was 15.6, I'd be like okay maybe there's\\na little bit of error here. Data that you collect in the real world is never going to be perfect. These are models that try to get us close to describing the data. But over here we keep multiplying it by a factor of roughly .8, roughly .8. Now you might be tempted\\nto immediately say, okay, well that means that C of t is going to be equal to\\nour initial temperature, 80 times a common ratio of 0.8 to the number of minutes that passed by. Now this is very tempting and it would be the case\\nif this was one minute and if this was two minutes but our change in temperature each time is our change in temperature\\neach time is two minutes so what we really should say is this is one way to think about it is that it takes two minutes to have a 0.8 change or to be multiplied by 0.8. So the real way to describe this would be t over two. Every two minutes when t is zero, we'd be at 80. After two minutes, we would take 80 times 0.8, which is what we got over here. After four minutes, it would be 80 times 0.8 squared. In fact, let's just verify that we feel pretty good about this. So if we had something like this. So t and C of t. So when t is zero, C of t is 80. When t is, well let me just do the\\nsame data that we have here. When t is two, we have 80 times, two over two is one so it's 80 times 0.8, which is pretty close to\\nwhat we have over here. When t is four, it would be 80 .0.8 squared which is pretty close to\\nwhat we have right over here. I can just calculate it for you. If I have .8 squared times 80, 51.2 Getting pretty close. This is a pretty good approximation. Pretty good model. So I'm liking this model. This isn't exactly one of the choices so how do we manipulate this a little bit? Well, we can remind ourselves that this is the same thing as 80 times 0.8 to the one half and then that to the t power. And what's .8 to the one half? So .8. That's the same thing as\\ntaking the square root of .8 It's roughly .89 So this is approximately 80 times 0.89 to the t power. And if you look at all of these choices, this one is pretty close to this. This model best fits the data, especially of the choices going, this is pretty close to the model that I just thought about. Now another way of doing it that might have been a little bit simpler. I like to do it this way because even if I didn't have choices, we would have gotten to\\nsomething reasonable. Another way to do it is to say okay, 80 is our initial state. All of these whether you're talking about exponential or linear models, start with 80 when t is equal to zero but it's clearly not a linear model because we're not changing by even roughly the same amount every time but it looks like every two minutes we're changing by a factor of .8 so we're going to have\\nan exponential model so you say okay, it will be\\none of these two choices. Now this one down here you could rule out because we're not changing\\nby a factor of 0.8 or 0.81 every minute. We're changing by a factor of 0.81 every two minutes so you could have ruled that one out and then you could have deduced to this right over here and you could have said, look, if I'm changing by a\\nfactor of .9 every minute then that would have been\\n.81 every two minutes which is pretty close to\\nwhat we're seeing here changing by a factor of about .8 or .81 every two minutes. So once again that's why\\nwe like that first choice. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Sal] Let\\'s explore the\\nnotion of a polynomial. This seems like a very complicated word, but if you break it down\\nit\\'ll start to make sense, especially when we start to\\nsee examples of polynomials. The first part of this word, lemme underline it, we have poly. This comes from Greek, for many. You see poly a lot in\\nthe English language, referring to the notion\\nof many of something. In this case, it\\'s many nomials. Nomial comes from Latin, from\\nthe Latin nomen, for name. You could view this as many names. But in a mathematical context, it\\'s really referring to many terms. We\\'re gonna talk, in a little bit, about what a term really is. But to get a tangible sense\\nof what are polynomials and what are not polynomials,\\nlemme give you some examples. And then we could write some, maybe, more formal rules for them. So, an example of a polynomial could be 10x to the seventh power\\nminus nine x squared plus 15x to the third plus nine. This is a polynomial. Another example of a polynomial. Nine a squared minus five. Even if I just have one number, even if I were to just\\nwrite the number six, that can officially be\\nconsidered a polynomial. If I were to write seven\\nx squared minus three. Lemme do it another variable. Seven y squared minus three y plus pi, that, too, would be a polynomial. These are examples of polynomials. What are examples of things\\nthat are not polynomials? Well, if I were to\\nreplace the seventh power right over here with a\\nnegative seven power. If I were to write 10x to\\nthe negative seven power minus nine x squared plus 15x\\nto the third power plus nine, this would not be a polynomial. So I think you might\\nbe sensing a rule here for what makes something a polynomial. You have to have nonnegative powers of your variable in each of the terms. I just used that word,\\nterms, so lemme explain it, \\'cause it\\'ll help me explain\\nwhat a polynomial is. A polynomial is something that\\nis made up of a sum of terms. And so, for example, in\\nthis first polynomial, the first term is 10x to the seventh; the second term is\\nnegative nine x squared; the next term is 15x to the third; and then the last term, maybe you could say the\\nfourth term, is nine. You can see something. Let me underline these. These are all terms. This is a four-term\\npolynomial right over here. You could say: \"Hey, wait,\\nthis thing you wrote in red, \"this also has four terms.\" We have to put a few more rules for it to officially be a polynomial, especially a polynomial in one variable. Each of those terms are going to be made up of a coefficient. This is the thing that multiplies the variable to some power. So in this first term\\nthe coefficient is 10. Lemme write this word down, coefficient. It\\'s another fancy word,\\nbut it\\'s just a thing that\\'s multiplied, in this case, times the variable, which\\nis x to seventh power. The first coefficient is 10. The next coefficient. Actually, lemme be careful here, because the second coefficient\\nhere is negative nine. We are looking at coefficients. The third coefficient here is 15. You can view this fourth\\nterm, or this fourth number, as the coefficient because\\nthis could be rewritten as, instead of just writing as nine, you could write it as\\nnine x to the zero power. And then it looks a little bit\\nclearer, like a coefficient. So, in general, a polynomial is the sum of a finite number of\\nterms where each term has a coefficient, which I could represent with the letter A, being\\nmultiplied by a variable being raised to a\\nnonnegative integer power. So, this right over here is a coefficient. It can be, if we\\'re dealing... Well, I don\\'t wanna get too technical. Positive, negative number. Could be any real number. We have our variable. And then the exponent,\\nhere, has to be nonnegative. Nonnegative integer. So here, the reason\\nwhy what I wrote in red is not a polynomial is because here I have an exponent that is a negative integer. Let\\'s give some other examples of things that are not polynomials. So, if I were to change the second one to, instead of nine a squared, if I wrote it as nine a to\\nthe one half power minus five, this is not a polynomial\\nbecause this exponent right over here, it is\\nno longer an integer; it\\'s one half. This is the same thing as nine times the square root of a minus five. This also would not be a polynomial. Or, if I were to write nine\\na to the a power minus five, also not a polynomial\\nbecause here the exponent is a variable; it\\'s not\\na nonnegative integer. All of these are examples of polynomials. There\\'s a few more pieces of terminology that are valuable to know. Polynomial is a general term\\nfor one of these expression that has multiple terms, a finite number, so not an infinite number, and each of the terms has this form. But there\\'s more specific terms for when you have only one term or\\ntwo terms or three terms. When you have one term,\\nit\\'s called a monomial. This is a monomial. This is an example of a monomial, which we could write as six x to the zero. Another example of a monomial might be 10z to the 15th power. That\\'s also a monomial. Your coefficient could be pi. Pi. Whoops. Could be pi. So we could write pi times\\nb to the fifth power. Any of these would be monomials. So what\\'s a binomial? Binomial\\'s where you have two terms. Monomial, mono for one, one term. Binomial is you have two terms. This right over here is a binomial. Binomial. You have two terms. All these are polynomials but\\nthese are subclassifications. It\\'s a binomial; you have one, two terms. Another example of a binomial would be three y to the third plus five y. Once again, you have two terms that have this form right over here. You\\'ll also hear the term trinomial. Trinomial\\'s when you have three terms. Trinomial. This right over here is an example. This is the first term; this is the second term; and this is the third term. Now, the next word that\\nyou will hear often in the context with\\npolynomials is the notion of the degree of a polynomial. You might hear people say: \"What is the degree of a polynomial?\", or \"What is the degree of a\\ngiven term of a polynomial?\" Let\\'s start with the\\ndegree of a given term. Let\\'s go to this polynomial here. We have this first term,\\n10x to the seventh. The degree is the power that\\nwe\\'re raising the variable to. So this is a seventh-degree term. The second term is a second-degree term. The third term is a third-degree term. And you could view this constant term, which is really just nine,\\nyou could view that as, sometimes people say the constant term. Sometimes people will\\nsay the zero-degree term. If people are talking about the degree of the entire polynomial,\\nthey\\'re gonna say: \"What is the degree of the highest term? \"What is the term with\\nthe highest degree?\" That degree will be the degree\\nof the entire polynomial. So, this first polynomial, this is a seventh-degree polynomial. This one right over here is\\na second-degree polynomial because it has a second-degree term and that\\'s the highest-degree term. This right over here is a third-degree. You could even say third-degree binomial because its highest-degree\\nterm has degree three. If this said five y to the\\nseventh instead of five y, then it would be a\\nseventh-degree binomial. This right over here is\\na 15th-degree monomial. This is a second-degree trinomial. A few more things I will introduce you to is the idea of a leading term\\nand a leading coefficient. Lemme write this down. The notion of what it means to be leading. It can mean whatever is the\\nfirst term or the coefficient. If you\\'re saying leading\\nterm, it\\'s the first term. If you\\'re saying leading coefficient, it\\'s the coefficient in the first term. But it\\'s oftentimes associated with a polynomial being\\nwritten in standard form. Standard form. Standard form is where you write the\\nterms in degree order, starting with the highest-degree term. So, for example, what I have up here, this is not in standard form; because I do have the\\nhighest-degree term first, but then I should go to the next highest, which is the x to the third. But here I wrote x squared\\nnext, so this is not standard. If I wanted to write it in standard form, it would be 10x to the seventh power, which is the highest-degree\\nterm, has degree seven. Then, 15x to the third. So, plus 15x to the third, which\\nis the next highest degree. Then, negative nine x squared is the next highest degree term. And then, the lowest-degree\\nterm here is plus nine, or plus nine x to zero. Now this is in standard form. I have written the terms in\\norder of decreasing degree, with the highest degree first. Here, it\\'s clear that your leading term is 10x to the seventh,\\n\\'cause it\\'s the first one, and our leading coefficient\\nhere is the number 10. So, there was a lot in that video, but hopefully the notion of a polynomial isn\\'t seeming too\\nintimidating at this point. These are really useful\\nwords to be familiar with as you continue on on your math journey. '),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We are told a\\nrectangle has a height of five and a width of 3x\\nsquared minus x plus two. Then we're told express the area of the entire rectangle, and the expression should be expanded. So pause this video and see if\\nyou could work through this. All right, now let's work\\nthrough this together. What this diagram is showing us is exactly an indicative rectangle, where its height is five and its width is 3x\\nsquared minus x plus two. What this shows us is is the area of the entire rectangle can be broken down into three smaller areas. You have this blue area right over here. Where the width is 3x\\nsquared, the height is five, so what's that area going to be? It's going to be the height times width. Five times 3x squared. That's the same thing as 15x squared. Now what about this purple\\narea right over here? It's going to be height times width again, so it'll be five times negative x, which is the same thing as negative 5x. I know what some of you are thinking, how can you have a width of negative x? Well, we don't know what x is, so this is all a little bit abstract. But you could imagine having\\nx be a negative value, in which case this actually\\nwould be a positive width. Another thing you might be saying is, hey, this magenta area,\\nwhen I just eyeball it, looks like it has a larger\\nwidth than this blue area. How do we know that? We don't. They're just showing this\\nas an indicative way. They might have actually the same width. They might have, one might\\nbe larger than the other, but this is just showing us that they're not necessarily the same. It's very abstract. It's definitely not drawn to scale 'cause we don't know what x is. All right, and then this last area is going to be the height, which is five, times the width, which is two. So that's just going to be equal to 10. So what we just saw is that\\nthe area of the whole thing is equal to the sum of these areas, and the sum of those areas is 15x squared plus negative 5x, or we could\\njust write that as minus 5x. And then we have plus 10. Now I know what some of you are thinking. If I know that the height is five and the width is this value, well couldn't I have\\njust multiplied height times the entire width, 3x\\nsquared minus x plus two, and then I would've just\\nnaturally distributed the five? And essentially that's\\nexactly what we did here. Area models, you might have first seen them in elementary school, really to understand the\\ndistributive property. So if you distribute the\\nfive you get 15x squared minus 5x plus 10. Same idea. Let's do another example. So here we're given another rectangle. It has a height of 2x. We see that right there. A width of 3x plus four. We see that over there. Express the area of the entire rectangle. So same drill. See if you can pause this video and work on this on your own. All right. Well, we can see that the height is 2x, the width in total is 3x plus four. But we can clearly see that\\nthe area of the entire thing can be broken up into this blue section and this magenta section. The blue section's area is 3x times 2x. So 3x times 2x, which\\nis equal to 6x squared. The magenta section is equal to width times height, its area. So that going to be equal to 8x. So the area of the whole thing is going to be the sum of these areas, which is going to be 6x squared plus 8x. And we're done. Once again, we could've\\njust thought about it as the height is 2x, we're gonna\\nmultiply it times the width, times 3x plus four. Then we just distribute the 2x. So 2x times 3x is 6x squared. 2x times four is 8x. Same idea. It's really just to\\nmake sure we understand that when we distribute a 2x\\nonto this 3x and this four, we can conceptualize it as figuring out the areas of the sub-parts\\nof the entire rectangle. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] So I have this\\nbig rectangle here that's divided into four smaller\\nrectangles, and what I wanna do is I wanna express the\\narea of this larger rectangle and I wanna do it two ways. The first way I wanna\\nexpress it as the product of two binomials and\\nthen I wanna express it as a trinomial, so let's\\nthink about this a little bit. So one way to say well look,\\nthe height of this larger rectangle from here to here,\\nwe see that that distance is x, and then from here to here it's two, so the entire height right over here, the entire height right over\\nhere is going to be x plus two. So the height is x plus\\ntwo, and what's the width? Well the width is, we go\\nfrom there to there is x, and then from there to there is three, so the entire width is x plus three. x plus three. So just like that, I've\\nexpressed the area of the entire rectangle, and it's\\nthe product of two binomials. But now let's express it as a trinomial. Well to do that, we can\\nbreak down the larger area into the areas of each of\\nthese smaller rectangles. So what's the area of this\\npurple rectangle right over here? Well the purple rectangle, its height is x and its width is x, so\\nits area is x squared. Let me write that, that's x squared. What's the area of this yellow rectangle? Well it's height is x, same\\nheight as right over here, its height is x and its width is three, so it's gonna be x times three, or 3x. It'll have an area of 3x. So that area is 3x, if\\nwe're summing up the area of the entire thing,\\nthis would be plus 3x. So this expression right\\nover here, that's the area of this purple region, plus\\nthe area of this yellow region, and then we can move on\\nto this green region. What's the area going to be here? Well the height is two and the width is x, so multiply height times\\nwidth is gonna be two times x, and we can just add\\nthat, plus two times x, and then finally this\\nlittle grey box here. Its height is two, we see\\nthat right over there, its height is two, and its width is three, we see it right over there,\\nso it has an area of six. Two times three. So plus six, and you might say\\nwell this isn't a trinomial, this has four terms right over here, but you might notice that we can add, that we can add these middle two terms, 3x plus 2x, if I have three\\nx's and I add two x's to that, I'm gonna have five x's. So this entire thing\\nsimplifies to x squared, x squared plus 5x plus six. Plus six. So this and this are two\\nways of expressing the area, so they're going to be\\nequal, and that makes sense 'cause if you multiply\\nit out, these binomials, and simplify it, you\\nwould get this trinomial, and we can do that really fast. You multiply the x times the\\nx, actually let me do that in the same colors. You multiply the x times the x, you get the x squared. You multiply this x times the three, you get your 3x. You multiply the two times the x, you get your 2x. And then you multiply\\nthe two times the three and you get your six. So what this, I guess you\\ncan say this area model does for us is it hopefully\\nmakes a visual representation of why it makes sense to\\nmultiply binomials the way we do, and in other videos we talk\\nabout it as applying the distribution property\\ntwice, but this gives you a more visual representation for why it actually makes sense. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Let's see\\nif we can figure out the product of x minus\\nfour and x plus seven. And we want to write that product\\nin standard quadratic form which is just a fancy way of saying a form where you have some coefficient\\non the second degree term, a x squared plus some coefficient b on the first degree term\\nplus the constant term. So this right over here would\\nbe standard quadratic form. So that's the form that we\\nwant to express this product in and encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. Alright, now let's work through this. And the key when we're multiplying\\ntwo binomials like this, or actually when you're\\nmultiplying any polynomials, is just to remember the\\ndistributive property that we all by this point know quite well. So what we could view this is as is we could distribute this x minus four, this entire expression\\nover the x and the seven. So we could say that\\nthis is the same thing as x minus four times x plus x minus four times seven. So let's write that. So x minus four times x,\\nor we could write this as x times x minus four. That's distributing, or multiplying\\nthe x minus four times x that's right there. Plus seven times x minus four. Times x minus four. Notice all we did is\\ndistribute the x minus four. We took this whole thing\\nand we multiplied it by each term over here. We multiplied x by x minus four and we multiplied seven by x minus four. Now, we see that we have these, I guess you can call\\nthem two seperate terms. And to simplify each of them,\\nor to multiply them out, we just have to distribute. In this first we're going to\\nhave to distribute this blue x. And over here we have to\\ndistribute this blue seven. So let's do that. So here we can say x times\\nx is going to be x squared. X times, we have a negative here, so we can say negative four is\\ngoing to be negative four x. And just like, that we get\\nx squared minus four x. And then over here we have seven times x so that's going to be plus seven x. And then we have seven\\ntimes the negative four which is negative 28. And we are almost done. We can simplify it a little bit more. We have two first degree terms here. If I have negative four xs\\nand to that I add seven xs, what is that going to be? Well those two terms together, these two terms together are going to be negative four plus seven xs. Negative four plus, plus seven. Negative four plus seven xs. So all I'm doing here,\\nI'm making it very clear that I'm adding these two coefficients, and then we have all of the other terms. We have the x squared. X squared plus this and then we have, and then we have the minus, and then we have the minus 28. And we're at the home stretch! This would simply to x squared. Now negative four plus seven is three, so this is going to be plus three x. That's what these two middle\\nterms simplify to, to three x. And then we have minus 28. Minus 28. And just like that, we are done! And a fun thing to think about,\\nsince it's in the same form. If we were to compare a is one, b is three, and c is -28, but it's interesting here\\nto look at the pattern when we multiplied these two binomials. Especially these two binomials\\nwhere the coefficient on the x term was a one. Notice we have x times x, that what actually forms the\\nx squared term over here. We have negative four, let\\nme do this in a new color. We have negative four times,\\nthat's not a new color. We have, we have negative four times seven, which is going to be negative 28. And then how did we get this middle term? How did we get this three x? Well, you had the negative\\nfour x plus the seven x. Or the negative four\\nplus the seven times x. You had the negative four plus the seven, plus the seven times x. So I hope you see a little\\nbit of a pattern here. If you're multiplying two binomials where the coefficients on\\nthe x term are both one. It's going to be x squared. And then the last term, the constant term, is going to be the product\\nof these two constants. Negative four and seven. And then the first degree\\nterm right over here, it's coefficient is going to be the sum of these two constants,\\nnegative four and seven. Now this might, you could do this pattern if you practice it. It's just something that will help you multiply binomials a little bit faster. But it's super important that you realize where this came from. This came from nothing more than applying the distributive property twice. \"),\n",
       " ('13.2.3',\n",
       "  \"Multiply (3x+2) by (5x-7). So we are multiplying two binomials. I am actually going to show you two really equivalent ways of doing this. One that you might hear in a classroom and it is kind of a more mechanical memorizing way of doing it which might be faster but you really don't know what you are doing and then there is the one where you are essentially just applying something what you already know and kind of a logical way. So I will first do the memorizing way that you might be exposed to and they'll use something called FOIL. So let me write this down here. So you can immediately see that whenever someone gives you a new mnemonic to memorize, that you are doing something pretty mechanical. So FOIL literally stands for First Outside, let me write it this way.....F O I L where the F in FOIL stands for First, the O in FOIL stand for Outside, the I stands for Inside and then the L stands for Last. The reason why I don't like these things is that when you are 35 years old, you are not going to remember what FOIL stood for and then you are not going to remember how to multiply this binomial. But lets just apply FOIL. So First says just multiply the first terms in each of these binomials. So just multiply the 3x times the 5x. So (3x. 5x). The Outside part tells us to multiply the outside terms. So in this case, you have 3x on the outside and you have -7 on the outside. So that is +3x(-7). The inside, well the inside terms here are 2 and 5x. So, (+2.5x) and then finally you have the last terms. You have the 2 and the -7. So the last terms are 2 times -7. 2(-7). So what you are essentially doing is just making sure that you are multipying each term by every other term here. What we are essentially doing is multiplying, doing the distributive property twice. We are multiplying the 3x times (5x-7). So 3x times (5x-7) is (3x . 5x) plus (3x - 7). And we are multiplying the 2 times (5x-7) to give us these terms. But anyway, lets just multiply these out just to get our answer. 3x times 5x is same thing as (3 times 5) ( x times x) which is the same thing as 15x square. You can just do this x to the first time to x to the first. You multiply the x to get x squared. 3 times 5 is 15. This term right here 3 times -7 is -21 and then you have your x right over here. And then you have this term which is 2 times 5 which is 10 times x. So +10x. And then finally you have this term here in blue. 2 times -7 is -14. And we aren't done yet, we can simplify this a little bit. We have two like terms here. We have this...let me find a new color. We have 2 terms with a x to the first power or just an x term right over here. So we have -21 of something and you add 10 or in another way, you have 10 of something and you subtract 21 of them, you are going to have -11 of that something. We put the other terms here, you have 15... 15x squared and then you have your -14 and we are done. Now I said I would show you another way to do it. I want to show you why the distributive property can get us here without having to memorize FOIL. So the distributive property tells us that if we 're... look if we are multipying something times an expression, you just have to multiply times every term in the expression. So we can distribute, we can distribute the 5x onto the 3..., or actually we could...well, let me view it this way... we could distribute the 5x-7, this whole thing onto the 3x+2. Let me just change the order since we are used to distributing something from the left. So this is the same thing as (5x-7)(3x+2). I just swapped the two expressions. And we can distribute this whole thing times each of these terms. Now what happens if I take (5x-7) times 3x? Well, thats just going to be 3x times (5x-7). So I have just distributed the 5x-7 times 3x and to that I am going to add 2 times 5x-7. I have just distributed the 5x-7 onto the 2. Now, you can do the distributive property again. We can distribute the 3x onto the 5x. We can distribute the 3x onto the 5x. And we can distribute the 3x onto the -7. We can distribute the 2 onto the 5x, over here and we can distribute the 2 on that -7. Now if we do it like this what do we get ? 3x times 5x, that's this right over here. If we do 3x times -7, that's this term right over here. If you do 2 times 5x, that's this term right over here. If you do 2 times -7, that is this term right over here. So we got the exact same result that we got with FOIL. Now, FOIL can be faster if you just wanted to do it and kind of skip to this step. I think its important that you know that this is how it actually works. Just in case you do forget this when you are 35 or 45 years old and you are faced with multiplying binomial, you just have to remember the distributive property. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Let's see\\nif we can figure out what x plus three times x minus three is, and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can work this out. Well, one way to tackle\\nit is the way that we've always tackled it when\\nwe multiply binomials, is just apply the\\ndistributive property twice. So first we can take this\\nentire yellow x plus three and multiply times each\\nof these two terms. So first we can multiply it times this x. So that's going to be\\nx times x plus three. And then we are going to multiply it times, we can\\nsay, this negative three. So we could write minus three times, now that's going to be multiplied by x plus three again. And then we apply the\\ndistributive property one more time. Where we take this magenta x and we distribute it across this x plus three so x times x is x squared, x times three is three x, and then we do it on this side. Negative three times x is negative three x and negative three times three is negative nine. And what does this simplify to? Well, we're gonna get x squared, and we have three x and minus three x so these two characters cancel out, and we are just left with x squared minus nine. And you might see a little pattern here, notice I added three and\\nthen I subtracted three and I got this, I got the x squared and then if you take three and multiply it by negative three, you are going to get a negative nine. And notice, the middle terms canceled out. And one thing you might ask is, well, will that always be the case, if we add a number and we subtract that same number like that? And we could try it out. Let's talk in general terms. So if we, instead of doing x plus three times x minus three, we could write this same thing as, instead of three, let's just say you have x plus a times x minus a. And I encourage you to pause this video and work it all out, just assume a is some number, like three or some other number, and apply the distributive property\\ntwice and see what you get. Well, let's work through it. So first we can distribute\\nthis yellow x plus a onto the x and the negative a. So x plus a times x, or we could say x times x plus a, that's going to be x times x plus a, and then we're going to have minus a, or this negative\\na, times x plus a. So minus, and then we're gonna have this minus a times x, plus a. Notice, all I did is I distributed this yellow, I distributed this big chunk of this expression, I just distributed it onto the x and onto this negative a. I'm multiplying it times the x and I'm multiplying it by the negative a. And now we can apply the\\ndistributive property again. X times x is x squared, x times a is ax, and then we get negative a times x is negative ax, and then negative a times a, is negative a squared. And notice, regardless of my choice of a, I'm going to have ax and then minus ax. So this is always going to cancel out. It didn't just work for\\nthe case when a was three. For any a, if I have a times x and then I subtract a times x, that's\\njust going to cancel out. So this is just going to cancel out, and what are we going to be left with? We are going to be left with x squared minus a squared. And you can view this as a special case. When you have something, x plus something, times x minus that same something, it's going to be x squared minus that something squared. And this is a good one to know in general. And we could use it to quickly figure out the products of other binomials that fit this pattern here. So if I were to say, quick, what is x plus 10, times x minus 10? Well, you could say, all right this fits the pattern, it's x plus a times x minus a, so it's going to be x\\nsquared minus a squared. If a is 10, a squared is going to be 100. So you can do it really quick once you recognize the pattern. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Let's see\\nif we can figure out what x plus seven, let me write\\nthat a little bit neater, x plus seven squared is. And I encourage you to pause the video and work through it on your own. Alright, now let's work\\nthrough this together. So we just have to remember, we're squaring the entire binomial. So this thing is going\\nto be the same thing as: x plus seven times x plus seven. I'm gonna write the second x plus seven in a different color, which is going to be helpful when we actually multiply things out. When we see it like this, then we can multiply these out the way we would multiply any binomials. And I'll first do it\\nthe, I guess you can say, the slower way, but\\nthe more intuitive way, applying the distributive property twice. And then we'll think\\nabout maybe some shortcuts or some patterns we might\\nbe able to recognize, especially when we are squaring binomials. So let's start with just applying the distributive property twice. So let's distribute\\nthis yellow x plus seven over this magenta x plus seven. So we can multiply it by\\nthe x, this magenta x, so it's going to be x, let\\nme do it in that same color. So it's going to be magenta x times x plus seven plus magenta seven times yellow x plus seven. X plus seven, and now we can apply the distributive property again. We can take this magenta x and distribute it over the x plus seven. So x times x is x-squared. X times seven is seven x. And then we can do it again over here. This seven, let me do\\nit in a different color, so this seven times that x is going to be plus another seven x and then the seven times the seven is going to be 49. And we're in the home stretch.\\nWe can then simplify it. This is going to be x-squared and then these two middle\\nterms we can add together. Seven x, let me do this in orange, seven x plus seven x is going to be 14 x plus 14 x plus 49. Plus 49. And we're done. Now the key question is do\\nwe see some patterns here? Do we see some patterns\\nthat we can generalize and that might help us square binomials a little bit faster in the future? Well, when we first looked at\\njust multiplying binomials, we saw a pattern like x plus a times x plus b is going to be equal to x-squared, let me write it this way, is going to be equal to x-squared plus a plus b x plus b-squared. And so, if both a and\\nb are the same thing, we can say that x plus a times x plus a is going to be equal to x-squared, and this is the case when we have a coefficient of one on both\\nof these x's, x-squared's. Now in this case, a and b are both a. So it's going to be a plus a times x, or we can just say plus two a x. Let me be clear what I just did. Instead of writing a plus b, I can just view this as a plus a times x, and then plus a-squared, or that's the same thing as x-squared plus two a x plus a-squared. This is a general way of expressing a squared binomial like this. A squared binomial where the coefficients on both x's are one. We can see that's exactly\\nwhat we saw over here. In this, in the example\\nwe did, seven is our a. So we got x-squared right\\nover there let me circle it. So we have this blue x-squared that corresponds to that over there. And then seven is our a, so two a x , two times seven is 14 x. Notice we have the 14 x right over there. So this 14 x corresponds to two a x, and then finally if a is seven, a-squared is 49. A-squared is 49. So in general if you are\\nsquaring a binomial, you could, a fast way of doing it is\\nto do this pattern here, and we can do another example real fast, just to make sure that\\nwe've understood things. If I were to tell you what is x minus, I'll throw a negative in here, x minus three squared, I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Think about expressing\\nthis using this pattern. Well this is going to\\nbe, in this case our a, we have to be careful, our a is going to be negative three, so that is our a right over there. So this is going to be equal to x-squared. Now two a x, let me do it\\nin the same colors actually, just for fun. So it's going to be x-squared. Now what is two times a times x? A is negative three, so two\\ntimes a is negative six. So it's going to be negative six x. So, minus six x, that's two\\ntimes a is the coefficient. And then we have our x there. And then plus a-squared. Well if a is negative three, what is negative three\\ntimes negative three? It's going to be positive nine. And just like that, when\\nwe looked at this pattern, we were able to very quickly figure out what this binomial squared actually is. And I encourage you, you can do it again, with applying the\\ndistributive property twice to verify that this is\\nindeed the same thing as x minus three squared. \"),\n",

But I want to find out\\nthe general pattern here. So a plus b times a. So we have a times a plus\\nb, that's this times this. And then a plus b\\ntimes negative b, that's negative\\nb times a plus b. So I've done distributive\\nproperty once, now I could do it again. I can distribute the a\\nonto the a and this b and it gives me a squared. a times a is a squared,\\nplus a times b, which is ab. And now I can do it\\nwith the negative b. Negative b times a is negative\\nab or negative ba, same thing. And negative b times b\\nis negative b squared. Now, what does this simplify to? Well, I have an ab, and\\nthen I'm subtracting an ab. So these two guys\\ncancel out and I am just left with a squared\\nminus b squared. So the general pattern,\\nand this is a good one to just kind of\\nknow super fast, is that a plus b times\\na minus b is always going to be a squared\\nminus b squared.

A lot of people will look at this and say oh, that's (7x)^2 + 10^2. This is WRONG. And I'll write it in caps. This is WRONG! What your brain is doing is thinking if I had 7x times 10 and I squared that, this would be (7x)^2 times 10^2. We aren't multiplying here, we're adding 7x to 10. So you can't just square each of these terms. I just wanted to highlight, this is completely wrong, and to see why it's wrong, you have to remind yourself that (7x + 10)^2 is the exact same thing as (7x + 10)(7x + 10). That's what it means to square something. You're multiplying it by itself twice here. So this is what it is, so we're really just multiplying a binomial, or two binomials, they just happen to be the same one, and you could use F.O.I.L., you could use the distributive method, but this is actually a special case: when you're squaring a binomial, so let's just think about it as a special case first then we can apply whatever we learn to this. So we could've just done it straight here, but I want to learn the general case so you can apply it to any problem that you might see. If I have (a+b) squared We already realised that it's not a squared plus b squared That is a plus b times a plus b. and now we can use the distributive property We can distribute this a + b times this a So we get, we get a times a plus b and we can distribute the a plus b times this b plus b times a plus b, and we distribute this a we get a squared plus ab plus b times a is another ab And I'm just swapping the order so it's the same as this. plus b times b which is b squared. These are the same or these are like terms. So we can add them. One of something plus another of that something will give you two of that something. 2 ab. We have a squared plus 2 ab plus b squared. So the pattern here, the pattern here, if I have a plus b squared it's equal to a squared plus 2 times the product of these numbers plus b squared. So over here I have seven x plus ten squared So this is going to be equal to seven x squared seven x squared plus 2 times the product of seven x and 10. 2 times seven x times 10 plus 10 squared. So, the difference between the right answer and the wrong answer is that you have this middle term here that you might have forgotten about if you did it this way. And this comes out when you are multiplying all the different combinations of the terms here. if we simplify this, if we simplify seven x squared That's seven squared times x squared. So seven squared is 49 times x squared When you multiply this part out 2 times 7 times 10 which is 140 and then we have our x. No other x there. And then plus 10 squared. So plus 100.

       "  \"- [Voiceover] You're probably\\nfamiliar with the general term factor. So if I were to say: What\\nare the factors of 12, you could say: Well what\\nare the whole numbers that I can multiply by another\\nwhole number to get 12? So for examples, you\\ncould say things like, well I could multiply\\none times 12 to get 12. So you could say that\\none is a factor of 12. You could even say that\\n12 is a factor of 12. You could say two times\\nsix is equal to 12, so you could say that\\ntwo is a factor of 12 and that six is also a factor of 12. And of course three times four is also 12, so both three and four are factors of 12. So if you said well what\\nare the factors of 12 and you've seen this\\nbefore, well you could say: one, two, three, four, six, and 12, those are all factors of 12. And you could also phase\\nit the other way around, so let me just give an example. So if I were to pick on\\nthree, I could say that three is a factor of 12. Or to phrase it slightly\\ndifferently, I could say that 12 is divisible, 12 is divisible by three. Now what I wanna do in this\\nvideo is extend this idea of being a factor or divisibility\\ninto the algebraic world. So for example, if I were to take 3xy. So this is a monomial with\\nan integer coefficient. Three is an integer right over here. And if I were to multiply\\nit with another monomial with an integer coefficient, I don't know, let's say times negative two X squared, Y to the third power, what is this going to be equal to? Well this would be equal to, if we multiply the coefficients,\\nthree times negative two is going to be negative six. X times X squared is X to the third power. And then Y times Y to the third is Y to the fourth power. And so what we could say is,\\nif we wanted to say factors of negative six X to the\\nthird, Y to the fourth, we could say that 3xy is a factor of this just as an example; so\\nlet me write that down. We could write that 3xy is a factor of, is a factor of... of negative six X to the\\nthird power, Y to the fourth, or we could phrase that\\nthe other way around. We could say that negative\\nsix X to the third, Y to the fourth, is divisible by, is divisible by 3xy. So hopefully you're seeing the parallels. If I'm taking these two monomials\\nwith integer coefficients and I multiply 'em and I get\\nthis other, in this case, this other monomial, I could\\nsay that either one of these and there's actually\\nother factors of this, but I could say either\\none of these is a factor of this monomial, or we\\ncould say that negative six X to the third, Y to the four is divisible by one of its factors. And we could even extend this\\nto binomials or polynomials. For example, if I were to take, if I were to take, let me scroll down a little bit, whoops, if I were to take, let me say X plus three and I wanted to multiply it times X plus seven, we know that this is going to be equal to, if I were to write it as a trinomial, it's gonna be X times X, so X squared, and then it's gonna be\\nthree X plus seven X, so plus 10x; and if any\\nof this looks familiar, we have a lot of videos\\nwhere we go in detail of multiplying binomials like this. And then three times seven is 21. Plus 21. So because I multiplied these\\ntwo, in this case binomials, or we could consider\\nthemselves to be polynomials, polynomials or binomials\\nwith integer coefficients. Notice the coefficients\\nhere, they're one, one. The constants here, they're all integers. Because I'm dealing with all\\nintegers here, we could say that either one of these\\nbinomials is a factor of this trinomial, or we could say this\\ntrinomial is divisible by either one of these. So let me write that down. So I could say, I'll just\\npick on X plus seven. We could say that X plus seven is a factor, is a factor of X squared plus 10x plus 21; or we could say that X squared plus 10x plus 21 is divisible by, is divisible by I could say X plus three\\nor I could say X plus seven is divisible by, X plus seven. And the key is, is that\\nboth of these binomials, or even if we were\\ndealing with polynomials, we are dealing with\\nthings that have integer, we're dealing with things that\\nhave integer coefficients. \"),\n",

And the key here\\nis to figure out are there any common\\nfactors to both 4x and 18? And we can factor that\\ncommon factor out. We're essentially\\ngoing to be reversing the distributive property. So for example, what\\nis the largest number that is-- or I could really say\\nthe largest expression-- that is divisible into\\nboth 4x and 18? Well, 4x is divisible\\nby 2, because we know that 4 is divisible by 2. And 18 is also\\ndivisible by 2, so we can rewrite 4x as\\nbeing 2 times 2x. If you multiply that side,\\nit's obviously going to be 4x. And then, we can write 18 as\\nthe same thing as 2 times 9. And now it might\\nbe clear that when you apply the\\ndistributive property, you'll usually end\\nup with a step that looks something like this. Now we're just going to\\nundistribute the two right over here. We're going to\\nfactor the two out. Let me actually just draw that. So we're going to\\nfactor the two out, and so this is going to\\nbe 2 times 2x plus 9. And if you were to-- wanted\\nto multiply this out, it would be 2 times\\n2x plus 2 times 9. It would be exactly\\nthis, which you would simplify as\\nthis, right up here. So there we have it. We have written\\nthis as the product of two expressions,\\n2 times 2x plus 9. Let's do this again. So let's say that I\\nhave 12 plus-- let me think of something\\ninteresting-- 32x. Actually since we-- just to get\\na little bit of variety here, let's put a y here, 12 plus 32y. Well, what's the\\nlargest number that's divisible into both 12 and 32? 2 is clearly divisible\\ninto both, but so is 4. And let's see. It doesn't look like\\nanything larger than 4 is divisible into\\nboth 12 and 32. The greatest common\\nfactor of 12 and 32 is 4, and y is only divisible\\ninto the second term, not into this first\\nterm right over here. So it looks like 4 is the\\ngreatest common factor. So we could rewrite each\\nof these as a product of 4 and something else. So for example, 12, we\\ncan rewrite as 4 times 3. And 32, we can\\nrewrite-- since it's going to be plus-- 4 times. Well if you divide 32y by\\n4, it's going to be 8y. And now once again, we\\ncan factor out the 4. So this is going to\\nbe 4 times 3 plus 8y. And once you do more and\\nmore examples of this, you're going to find\\nthat you can just do this stuff all at once. You can say hey, what's\\nthe largest number that's divisible into both of these? Well, it's 4, so let\\nme factor a 4 out. 12 divided by 4 is 3. 32y divided by 4 is 8y. \"),\n",

Or to put it another way, I want to write it as\\nthe product x plus a, that's one binomial, times x plus b, where we need to figure out\\nwhat a and b are going to be. So I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure\\nout what a and b need to be. Can we rewrite this\\nexpression as the product of two binomials where\\nwe know what a and b are? So let's work through this together now. I'll highlight a and\\nb in different colors. I'll put a in yellow and\\nI'll put b in magenta. So one way to think about\\nit is let's just multiply these two binomials using a and b, and we've done this in previous videos. You might want to review\\nmultiplying binomials if any of this looks strange to you. But if you were to multiply what we have on the right-hand side\\nout it would be equal to, you're going to have the x times the x which is going to be x squared. Then you're going to\\nhave the a times the x, which is ax. And then you're going to\\nhave the b times the x, which is bx. Actually just let me, I'm\\nnot gonna skip any steps here just to see it this time. This is all review, or should be review. So then we have, so we did\\nx times x to get x squared. Then we have a times x\\nto get ax, to get a x. And then we're gonna have x times b, so we're multiplying each\\nterm times every other term. So then we have x times b to get bx. So plus bx. b x. And then finally we have\\nplus the a times the b, which is of course going to be ab. And now we can simplify this, and you might have been\\nable to go straight to this if you are familiar with\\nmultiplying binomials. This would be x squared plus, we can add these two coefficients because they're both on\\nthe first degree terms, they're both multiplied by x. If I have ax's and I add bx's to that I'm going to have a plus b x's. So let me write that down. a plus b x's, and then\\nfinally I have the plus, I'll do that blue color,\\nfinally I have it. I have plus ab. Plus ab. And now we can use this to think about what a and b need to be. If we do a little bit of pattern matching, we see we have an x squared there, we have an x squared there. We have something times x, in this case it's a\\nnegative three times x. And here we have something times x. So one way to think about it is that a plus b needs to be\\nequal to negative three. They need to add up to\\nbe this coefficient. So let me write that down. So we have a plus b needs to\\nbe equal to negative three. And we're not done yet. We finally look at this last\\nterm, we have a times b. Well a times b needs to\\nbe equal to negative 10. So let's write that down. So we have a times b needs\\nto be equal to negative 10. And in general, whenever\\nyou're factoring something, a quadratic expression that has\\na one on second degree term, so it has a one coefficient\\non the x squared, you don't even see it but\\nit's implicitly there. You could write this as one x squared. A way to factor it is to\\ncome up with two numbers that add up to the coefficient\\non the first degree term, so two numbers that add\\nup to negative three. And if I multiply those same two numbers, I'm going to get negative 10. So two numbers that add\\nup to negative three, to add up to the coefficient here. And now when I multiply it,\\nI get the constant term. I get this right over here. Two numbers when I\\nmultiply I get negative 10. Well what could those numbers be? Well since when you multiply\\nthem we get a negative number, we know that they're going\\nto have different signs. And so let's see how we\\ncould think about it. And since when we add them\\nwe get a negative number, we know that the negative\\nnumber must be the larger one. So if I were to just factor 10, 10 you could do that as one times ten, or two times five. And two and five are interesting because if one of them are negative, their difference is three. So if one is negative... So let's see if we're\\ntalking about negative 10, you could say negative two times five. And when you multiply them\\nyou do get negative 10. But if you add these two, you're going to get positive three. But what if you went positive\\ntwo times negative five. Now this is interesting because still when you multiply them\\nyou get negative 10. And when you add them,\\ntwo plus negative five is going to be negative three. So we have just figured\\nout our two numbers. We could say that a is two or\\nwe could say that b is two, but I'll just say that a is equal to two and b is equal to negative five. And so our original expression, we can rewrite as, so we can rewrite x squared\\nminus three x minus 10. We can say that that\\nis going to be equal to x plus two times x, instead\\nof saying plus negative five which we could say, we could just say, actually let me write that down. I could write just plus\\nnegative five right over there because that's our b. I could just write x minus\\nfive, and we're done. We've just factored it as\\na product of two binomials. Now, I did it fairly involved mainly so you see where all this came from. But in the future whenever you\\nsee a quadratic expression, and you have a one coefficient on the second degree term right over here, you could say alright well I\\nneed to figure out two numbers that add up to the coefficient\\non the first degree term, on the x term, and those same two numbers when I multiply them need to\\nbe equal to this constant term, need to be equal to negative 10. You say okay well let's see, they're gonna be different signs because when I multiply them\\nI get a negative number. The negative one is\\ngonna be the larger one, since when I add them I\\ngot a negative number. So let's see, let's say five\\nand two seem interesting. Well negative five and positive two, when you add them you're\\ngonna get negative three, when you multiply them\\nyou get negative 10. \"),\n",

So let's do that over here. If we look at our\\ncoefficient on x, can we think of\\nan a plus ab that is equal to that\\nnumber negative 14? And can we think\\nof the same a and b that if we were to\\ntake its product, it would be equal to 40? So what's an a and a b\\nthat would work over here? Well, let's think about\\nthis a little bit. If I have 4 times 10\\nis 40, but 4 plus 10 is equal to positive 14. So that wouldn't quite work. What happens if we make\\nthem both negative? If we have negative\\n4 plus negative 10, well that's going to be\\nequal to negative 14. And negative 4 times\\nnegative 10 is equal to 40. The fact that this number\\nright over here is positive, this number right\\nover here is positive, tells you that these are\\ngoing to be the same sign. If this number right\\nover here was negative, then we would have\\ndifferent signs. And so if you have\\n2 numbers that are going to be the same\\nsign and they add up to a negative number,\\nthen that tells you that they're both\\ngoing to be negative. So just going back\\nto this, we know that a is going to be negative\\n4, b is equal to negative 10, and we are done factoring it. We can factor this expression\\nas x plus negative 4 times x plus negative 10. Or another way to\\nwrite that, that's x minus 4 times x minus 10. Now let's do the\\nsame thing over here. Can we think of\\nan a plus b that's equal to the coefficient\\non the x term? Well, the coefficient\\non the x term here is essentially\\nnegative 1 times x. So we could say the\\ncoefficient is negative 1. And can we think of\\nan a times b where it's going to be\\nequal to negative 12? Well, let's think about\\nthis a little bit. The product of the 2\\nnumbers is negative, so that means that they\\nhave different signs. So one will be positive\\nand one will be negative. And so when I add the two\\ntogether, I get to negative 1. Well, just think about the\\nfactors of negative 12. Well, what about if one is 3\\nand maybe one is negative 4. Well, that seems to work. And you really just have\\nto try these numbers out. If a is 3 plus\\nnegative 4, that indeed turns out to be negative 1. And if we have 3\\ntimes negative 4, that indeed is equal\\nto negative 12.

Sometimes a quadratic\\npolynomial, or just a quadratic itself, or quadratic\\nexpression, but all it means is a second degree polynomial. So something that's going to\\nhave a variable raised to the second power. In this case, in all of the\\nexamples we'll do, it'll be x. So let's say I have the\\nquadratic expression, x squared plus 10x, plus 9. And I want to factor it into the\\nproduct of two binomials. How do we do that? Well, let's just think about\\nwhat happens if we were to take x plus a, and multiply\\nthat by x plus b. If we were to multiply these\\ntwo things, what happens? Well, we have a little bit\\nof experience doing this. This will be x times x, which is\\nx squared, plus x times b, which is bx, plus a times x,\\nplus a times b-- plus ab. Or if we want to add these two\\nin the middle right here, because they're both\\ncoefficients of x. We could right this as x squared\\nplus-- I can write it as b plus a, or a plus\\nb, x, plus ab. So in general, if we assume that\\nthis is the product of two binomials, we see that this\\nmiddle coefficient on the x term, or you could say the\\nfirst degree coefficient there, that's going to be\\nthe sum of our a and b. And then the constant term is\\ngoing to be the product of our a and b. Notice, this would map\\nto this, and this would map to this. And, of course, this is the\\nsame thing as this. So can we somehow pattern\\nmatch this to that? Is there some a and b where\\na plus b is equal to 10? And a times b is equal to 9? Well, let's just think about\\nit a little bit. What are the factors of 9? What are the things that a\\nand b could be equal to? And we're assuming that\\neverything is an integer. And normally when we're\\nfactoring, especially when we're beginning to factor,\\nwe're dealing with integer numbers. So what are the factors of 9? They're 1, 3, and 9. So this could be a 3 and a 3,\\nor it could be a 1 and a 9. Now, if it's a 3 and a 3, then\\nyou'll have 3 plus 3-- that doesn't equal 10. But if it's a 1 and a\\n9, 1 times 9 is 9. 1 plus 9 is 10. So it does work. So a could be equal to 1, and\\nb could be equal to 9. So we could factor this\\nas being x plus 1, times x plus 9. And if you multiply these two\\nout, using the skills we developed in the last few\\nvideos, you'll see that it is indeed x squared plus\\n10x, plus 9. So when you see something like\\nthis, when the coefficient on the x squared term, or the\\nleading coefficient on this quadratic is a 1, you can just\\nsay, all right, what two numbers add up to this\\ncoefficient right here? And those same two numbers, when\\nyou take their product, have to be equal to 9. And of course, this has to\\nbe in standard form. Or if it's not in standard form,\\nyou should put it in that form, so that you can\\nalways say, OK, whatever's on the first degree coefficient,\\nmy a and b have to add to that. Whatever's my constant term, my\\na times b, the product has to be that. Let's do several\\nmore examples. I think the more examples\\nwe do the more sense this'll make. Let's say we had x squared\\nplus 10x, plus-- well, I already did 10x, let's do a\\ndifferent number-- x squared plus 15x, plus 50. And we want to factor this. Well, same drill. We have an x squared term. We have a first degree term. This right here should be\\nthe sum of two numbers. And then this term, the constant\\nterm right here, should be the product\\nof two numbers. So we need to think of two\\nnumbers that, when I multiply them I get 50, and when\\nI add them, I get 15. And this is going to be a bit of\\nan art that you're going to develop, but the more practice\\nyou do, you're going to see that it'll start to\\ncome naturally. So what could a and b be? Let's think about the\\nfactors of 50. It could be 1 times 50. 2 times 25. Let's see, 4 doesn't\\ngo into 50. It could be 5 times 10. I think that's all of them. Let's try out these numbers,\\nand see if any of these add up to 15. So 1 plus 50 does not\\nadd up to 15. 2 plus 25 does not\\nadd up to 15. But 5 plus 10 does\\nadd up to 15. So this could be 5 plus 10, and\\nthis could be 5 times 10. So if we were to factor this,\\nthis would be equal to x plus 5, times x plus 10. And multiply it out. I encourage you to multiply this\\nout, and see that this is indeed x squared plus\\n15x, plus 10. In fact, let's do it. x\\ntimes x, x squared. x times 10, plus 10x. 5 times x, plus 5x. 5 times 10, plus 50. Notice, the 5 times\\n10 gave us the 50. The 5x plus the 10x is giving\\nus the 15x in between. So it's x squared plus\\n15x, plus 50. Let's up the stakes a little\\nbit, introduce some negative signs in here. Let's say I had x squared\\nminus 11x, plus 24. Now, it's the exact\\nsame principle. I need to think of two numbers,\\nthat when I add them, need to be equal\\nto negative 11. a plus b need to be equal\\nto negative 11. And a times b need to\\nbe equal to 24. Now, there's something for\\nyou to think about. When I multiply both of these\\nnumbers, I'm getting a positive number. I'm getting a 24. That means that both of these\\nneed to be positive, or both of these need to be negative. That's the only way I'm going to\\nget a positive number here. Now, if when I add them, I get\\na negative number, if these were positive, there's no way I\\ncan add two positive numbers and get a negative number, so\\nthe fact that their sum is negative, and the fact that\\ntheir product is positive, tells me that both a\\nand b are negative. a and b have to be negative. Remember, one can't be negative\\nand the other one can't be positive, because the\\nproduct would be negative. And they both can't be positive,\\nbecause when you add them it would get you\\na positive number. So let's just think about\\nwhat a and b can be. So two negative numbers. So let's think about\\nthe factors of 24. And we'll kind of have to think\\nof the negative factors. But let me see, it could be 1\\ntimes 24, 2 times 11, 3 times 8, or 4 times 6. Now, which of these when I\\nmultiply these-- well, obviously when I multiply\\n1 times 24, I get 24. When I get 2 times 11-- sorry,\\nthis is 2 times 12. I get 24. So we know that all these,\\nthe products are 24. But which two of these, which\\ntwo factors, when I add them, should I get 11? And then we could say,\\nlet's take the negative of both of those. So when you look at these,\\n3 and 8 jump out. 3 times 8 is equal to 24. 3 plus 8 is equal to 11. But that doesn't quite\\nwork out, right? Because we have a negative\\n11 here. But what if we did negative\\n3 and negative 8? Negative 3 times negative 8\\nis equal to positive 24. Negative 3 plus negative 8\\nis equal to negative 11. So negative 3 and\\nnegative 8 work. So if we factor this, x squared\\nminus 11x, plus 24 is going to be equal to x minus\\n3, times x minus 8. Let's do another\\none like that. Actually, let's mix it\\nup a little bit. Let's say I had x squared\\nplus 5x, minus 14. So here we have a different\\nsituation. The product of my two numbers is\\nnegative, right? a times b is equal to negative 14. My product is negative. That tells me that one of them\\nis positive, and one of them is negative. And when I add the two, a plus\\nb, it'd be equal to 5. So let's think about\\nthe factors of 14. And what combinations of them,\\nwhen I add them, if one is positive and one is negative,\\nor I'm really kind of taking the difference of the\\ntwo, do I get 5? So if I take 1 and 14-- I'm just\\ngoing to try out things-- 1 and 14, negative 1 plus\\n14 is negative 13. Negative 1 plus 14 is 13. So let me write all of the\\ncombinations that I could do. And eventually your brain\\nwill just zone in on it. So you've got negative 1\\nplus 14 is equal to 13. And 1 plus negative 14 is\\nequal to negative 13. So those don't work. That doesn't equal 5. Now what about 2 and 7? If I do negative 2-- let me do\\nthis in a different color-- if I do negative 2 plus 7,\\nthat is equal to 5. We're done! That worked! I mean, we could have tried 2\\nplus negative 7, but that'd be equal to negative 5, so that\\nwouldn't have worked. But negative 2 plus 7 works. And negative 2 times\\n7 is negative 14. So there we have it. We know it's x minus\\n2, times x plus 7. That's pretty neat. Negative 2 times 7\\nis negative 14. Negative 2 plus 7\\nis positive 5. Let's do several more of these,\\njust to really get well honed this skill. So let's say we have x squared\\nminus x, minus 56. So the product of the two\\nnumbers have to be minus 56, have to be negative 56. And their difference, because\\none is going to be positive, and one is going to be\\nnegative, right? Their difference has\\nto be negative 1. And the numbers that immediately\\njump out in my brain-- and I don't know if they\\njump out in your brain, we just learned this in\\nthe times tables-- 56 is 8 times 7. I mean, there's other numbers. It's also 28 times 2. It's all sorts of things. But 8 times 7 really jumped\\nout into my brain, because they're very close\\nto each other. And we need numbers that are\\nvery close to each other. And one of these has to be\\npositive, and one of these has to be negative. Now, the fact that when their\\nsum is negative, tells me that the larger of these two should\\nprobably be negative. So if we take negative\\n8 times 7, that's equal to negative 56. And then if we take negative\\n8 plus 7, that is equal to negative 1, which is exactly the\\ncoefficient right there. So when I factor this, this\\nis going to be x minus 8, times x plus 7. This is often one of the hardest\\nconcepts people learn in algebra, because it\\nis a bit of an art. You have to look at all of the\\nfactors here, play with the positive and negative signs,\\nsee which of those factors when one is positive, one is\\nnegative, add up to the coefficient on the x term. But as you do more and more\\npractice, you'll see that it'll become a bit\\nof second nature. Now let's step up the stakes\\na little bit more. Let's say we had negative x\\nsquared-- everything we've done so far had a positive\\ncoefficient, a positive 1 coefficient on the\\nx squared term. But let's say we had a\\nnegative x squared minus 5x, plus 24. How do we do this? Well, the easiest way I can\\nthink of doing it is factor out a negative 1, and then it\\nbecomes just like the problems we've been doing before. So this is the same thing as\\nnegative 1 times positive x squared, plus 5x, minus 24. Right? I just factored a\\nnegative 1 out. You can multiply negative 1\\ntimes all of these, and you'll see it becomes this. Or you could factor the negative\\n1 out and divide all of these by negative 1. And you get that right there. Now, same game as before. I need two numbers, that when\\nI take their product I get negative 24. So one will be positive,\\none will be negative. When I take their sum,\\nit's going to be 5. So let's think about\\n24 is 1 and 24. Let's see, if this is negative 1\\nand 24, it'd be positive 23, if it was the other way around,\\nit'd be negative 23. Doesn't work. What about 2 and 12? Well, if this is negative--\\nremember, one of these has to be negative. If the 2 is negative, their\\nsum would be 10. If the 12 is negative, their\\nsum would be negative 10. Still doesn't work. 3 and 8. If the 3 is negative,\\ntheir sum will be 5. So it works! So if we pick negative 3 and\\n8, negative 3 and 8 work. Because negative\\n3 plus 8 is 5. Negative 3 times 8\\nis negative 24. So this is going to be equal\\nto-- can't forget that negative 1 out front, and then\\nwe factor the inside. Negative 1 times x minus\\n3, times x plus 8. And if you really wanted to,\\nyou could multiply the negative 1 times this,\\nyou would get 3 minus x if you did. Or you don't have to. Let's do one more of these. The more practice, the\\nbetter, I think. All right, let's say I had\\nnegative x squared plus 18x, minus 72. So once again, I like to factor\\nout the negative 1. So this is equal to negative\\n1 times x squared, minus 18x, plus 72. Now we just have to think of\\ntwo numbers, that when I multiply them I get\\npositive 72. So they have to be\\nthe same sign. And that makes it easier in our\\nhead, at least in my head. When I multiply them,\\nI get positive 72. When I add them, I\\nget negative 18. So they're the same sign, and\\ntheir sum is a negative number, they both must\\nbe negative. And we could go through all\\nof the factors of 72. But the one that springs up,\\nmaybe you think of 8 times 9, but 8 times 9, or negative 8\\nminus 9, or negative 8 plus negative 9, doesn't work. That turns into 17. That was close. Let me show you that. Negative 9 plus negative 8, that\\nis equal to negative 17. Close, but no cigar. So what other ones are there? We have 6 and 12. That actually seems\\npretty good. If we have negative 6 plus\\nnegative 12, that is equal to negative 18. Notice, it's a bit of an art. You have to try the different\\nfactors here. So this will become negative\\n1-- don't want to forget that-- times x minus 6,\\ntimes x minus 12. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Averil was trying to factor six x squared minus 18x plus 12. She found that the greatest common factor of these terms was six\\nand made an area model. What is the width of Averil's area model? So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out, and then we'll work through this together. All right, so there's a couple\\nof ways to think about it. She's trying to factor six x squared minus 18x plus 12, and she figured out that the\\ngreatest common factor was six. So one way you could think about it is this could be rewritten as\\nsix times something else. And to help her think about it, she thought about an area model, where if you had a rectangle, if you had a rectangle like this, and if the height is six and the width, let's just call that the width for now, so this is the width right over here. If you multiply six times the width, maybe I could write width right over here, if you multiply six times the width, you multiply the height times the width, you're going to get the area. So imagine that the area of this rectangle was our original expression, six x squared minus 18x plus 12. And that's exactly what's drawn here. Now, what's interesting\\nis is that they broke up the area into three sections. This pink section is the six x squared, this blue section is the negative 18x, and this peach section is the 12. And, of course, these\\naren't drawn to scale, 'cause we don't even know\\nhow wide each of these are 'cause we don't know what x is. So this is all a little bit abstract, but it's to show that we\\ncan break our bigger area into three smaller areas. And what's useful about\\nthis is we could think about the width of each of these sub-areas, and then we can add them together to figure out the total width. So what is the width of this\\npink section right over here? Well, six times what is six x squared? Well, six times x\\nsquared is six x squared, so the width here is x squared. Now, what about this blue area? A height of six times what width is equal to negative 18x? So let's see, if I take\\nsix times negative three, I get negative 18, then I have to multiply\\nit times an x as well to get negative 18x. So six times negative\\nthree x is negative 18x. And then, last but not least, six, our height of six, times what is going to be equal to 12? Well, six times two is equal to 12. So we figured out the widths\\nof each of these subregions, and now we know what the total width is. The total width is going\\nto be our x squared plus our negative three x, plus our two. So the width is going to be x squared, and I can just write that as, minus three x, plus two. So we have answered the question. And you could substitute\\nthat back in for this, and you could see, if\\nyou multiplied six times all of this, if you distributed the six, you would indeed get six x\\nsquared minus 18x plus 12. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] So let's\\nsee if we can try to factor the following expression completely. So factor this completely, pause the video and have a go at that. All right, now let's work\\nthrough this together. So the way that I like to think about it, I first try to see is\\nthere any common factor to all the terms, and I\\ntry to find the greatest of the common factor, possible common factors\\nto all of the terms. So let's see, they're\\nall divisible by two, so two would be a common factor, but let's see, they're\\nalso all divisible by four, four is divisible by four,\\neight is divisible by four, 12 is divisible by four, and that looks like the\\ngreatest common factor. They're not all divisible by x, so I can't throw an x in there. So what I wanna do is factor out a four. So I could re-write this as four times, now what would it be, four times what? Well if I factor a four\\nout of four x squared, I'm just going to be\\nleft with an x squared. If I factor a four out\\nof negative eight x, negative eight x divided\\nby four is negative two, so I'm going to have negative two x. And if I factor a four out of negative 12, negative 12 divided by\\nfour is negative three. Now am I done factoring? Well it looks like I\\ncould factor this thing a little bit more. Can I think of two numbers\\nthat add up to negative two, and when I multiply it\\nI get negative three, since when I multiply\\nI get a negative value, one of the 'em is going to be positive and one of 'em is going to be negative. I can think about it this way. A plus B is equal to negative two, A times B needs to be\\nequal to negative three. So let's see, A could be\\nequal to negative three and B could be equal to one because negative three\\nplus one is negative two, and negative three times\\none is negative three. So I could re-write all of this as four times x plus negative three, or I could just write\\nthat as x minus three, times x plus one, x plus one. And now I have actually\\nfactored this completely. Let's do another example. So let's say that we had the expression negative three x squared\\nplus 21 x minus 30. Pause the video and see if you\\ncan factor this completely. All right now let's do this together. So what would be the\\ngreatest common factor? So let's see, they're\\nall divisible by three, so you could factor out a three. Let's see what happens if\\nyou factor out a three. This is the same thing as three times, well negative three x squared divided by three is negative x squared, 21 x divided by three is\\nseven x, so plus seven x, and then negative 30 divided\\nby three is negative 10. You could do it this way, but having this negative\\nout on the x squared term still makes it a little bit confusing on how you would factor this further. You can do it, but it still takes a little bit more of a mental load. So instead of just factoring out a three, let's factor out a negative three. So we could write it this way. If we factor out a negative\\nthree, what does that become? Well then if you factor\\nout a negative three out of this term, you're just\\nleft with an x squared. If you factor out a negative\\nthree from this term, 21 divided by negative\\nthree is negative seven x. And if you factor out a negative\\nthree out of negative 30, you're left with a\\npositive 10, positive 10. And now let's see if we\\ncan factor this thing a little bit more. Can I think of two numbers\\nwhere if I were to add them I get to negative seven, and if I were to multiply\\nthem, I get to 10? And let's see, they'd\\nhave to have the same sign 'cause their product is positive. So let's see A could be\\nequal to negative five, and then B is equal to negative two. So I can re-write this\\nwhole thing as equal to negative three times\\nx plus negative five, which is the same thing as x minus five, times x plus negative two, which is the same thing as x minus two. And now we have factored completely. \"),\n",

       "  \"In this video, I want to focus\\non a few more techniques for factoring polynomials. And in particular, I want to\\nfocus on quadratics that don't have a 1 as the leading\\ncoefficient. For example, if I wanted\\nto factor 4x squared plus 25x minus 21. Everything we've factored so\\nfar, or all of the quadratics we've factored so far, had\\neither a 1 or negative 1 where this 4 is sitting. All of a sudden now, we\\nhave this 4 here. So what I'm going to teach you\\nis a technique called, factoring by grouping. And it's a little bit more\\ninvolved than what we've learned before, but\\nit's a neat trick. To some degree, it'll become\\nobsolete once you learn the quadratic formula, because,\\nfrankly, the quadratic formula is a lot easier. But this is how it goes. I'll show you the technique. And then at the end of this\\nvideo, I'll actually show you why it works. So what we need to do here,\\nis we need to think of two numbers, a and b, where a\\ntimes b is equal 4 times negative 21. So a times b is going to be\\nequal to 4 times negative 21, which is equal to negative 84. And those same two numbers,\\na plus b, need to be equal to 25. Let me be very clear. This is the 25, so they need\\nto be equal to 25. This is where the 4 is. So we go, 4 times negative 21. That's a negative 21. So what two numbers are there\\nthat would do this? Well, we have to look at the\\nfactors of negative 84. And once again, one\\nof these are going to have to be positive. The other ones are going to have\\nto be negative, because their product is negative. So let's think about\\nthe different factors that might work. 4 and negative 21 look\\ntantalizing, but when you add them, you get negative 17. Or, if you had negative 4 and\\n21, you'd get positive 17. Doesn't work. Let's try some other\\ncombinations. 1 and 84, too far apart when\\nyou take their difference. Because that's essentially what\\nyou're going to do, if one is negative and\\none is positive. Too far apart. Let's see you could do 3--\\nI'm jumping the gun. 2 and 42. Once again, too far apart. Negative 2 plus 42 is 40. 2 plus negative 42 is negative\\n40-- too far apart. 3 and-- Let's see, 3 goes into\\n84-- 3 goes into 8 2 times. 2 times 3 is 6. 8 minus 6 is 2. Bring down the 4. Goes exactly 8 times. So 3 and 28. This seems interesting. And remember, one of these\\nhas to be negative. So if we have negative 3 plus\\n28, that is equal to 25. Now, we've found our\\ntwo numbers. But it's not going to be quite\\nas simple of an operation as what we did when this was\\na 1 or negative 1. What we're going to do now is\\nsplit up this term right here. We're going to split it up into\\npositive 28x minus 3x. We're just going to\\nsplit that term. That term is that term\\nright there. And of course, you have your\\nminus 21 there, and you have your 4x squared over here. Now, you might say, how did you\\npick the 28 to go here, and the negative\\n3 to go there? And it actually does matter. The way I thought about it is\\n3 or negative 3, and 21 or negative 21 , they have\\nsome common factors. In particular, they have\\nthe factor 3 in common. And 28 and 4 have some\\ncommon factors. So I grouped the 28 on\\nthe side of the 4. And you're going to see what\\nI mean in a second. If we, literally, group these\\nso that term becomes 4x squared plus 28x. And then, this side, over\\nhere in pink, it's plus negative 3x minus 21. Once again, I picked these. I grouped the negative 3 with\\nthe 21, or the negative 21, because they're both\\ndivisible by 3. And I grouped the 28 with the\\n4, because they're both divisible by 4. And now, in each of these\\ngroups, we factor as much out as we can. So both of these terms\\nare divisible by 4x. So this orange term is equal\\nto 4x times x-- 4x squared divided by 4x is just x-- plus\\n28x divided by 4x is just 7. Now, this second term. Remember, you factor\\nout everything that you can factor out. Well, both of these terms are\\ndivisible by 3 or negative 3. So let's factor out\\na negative 3. And this becomes x plus 7. And now, something might\\npop out at you. We have x plus 7 times\\n4x plus, x plus 7 times negative 3. So we can factor out\\nan x plus 7. This might not be completely\\nobvious. You're probably not\\nused to factoring out an entire binomial. But you could view this\\ncould be like a. Or if you have 4xa minus 3a,\\nyou would be able to factor out an a. And I can just leave this\\nas a minus sign. Let me delete this\\nplus right here. Because it's just\\nminus 3, right? Plus negative 3, same\\nthing as minus 3. So what can we do here? We have an x plus 7, times 4x. We have an x plus 7,\\ntimes negative 3. Let's factor out the x plus 7. We get x plus 7, times\\n4x minus 3. Minus that 3 right there. And we've factored\\nour binomial. Sorry, we've factored our\\nquadratic by grouping. And we factored it into\\ntwo binomials. Let's do another example of\\nthat, because it's a little bit involved. But once you get the hang\\nof it's kind of fun. So let's say we want to factor\\n6x squared plus 7x plus 1. Same drill. We want to find a times b that\\nis equal to 1 times 6, which is equal to 6. And we want to find an a plus\\nb needs to be equal to 7. This is a little bit more\\nstraightforward. What are the-- well, the obvious\\none is 1 and 6, right? 1 times 6 is 6. 1 plus 6 is 7. So we have a is equal to 1. Or let me not even\\nassign them. The numbers here are 1 and 6. Now, we want to split this\\ninto a 1x and a 6x. But we want to group it so it's\\non the side of something that it shares a factor with. So we're going to have a 6x\\nsquar ed here, plus-- and so I'm going to put the\\n6x first because 6 and 6 share a factor. And then, we're going to\\nhave plus 1x, right? 6x plus 1x equals 7x . That was the whole point. They had to add up to 7 . And then we have the\\nfinal plus 1 there. Now, in each of these groups,\\nwe can factor out as much as we like. So in this first group,\\nlet's factor out a 6x. So this first group becomes 6x\\ntimes-- 6x squar ed divided by 6x is just an x. 6x divided by 6x is just a 1. And then, the second\\ngroup-- we're going to have a plus here. But this second group, we just\\nliterally have a x plus 1. Or we could even write a\\n1 times an x plus 1. You could imagine I just\\nfactored out of 1 so to speak. Now, I have 6x times x plus\\n1, plus 1 times x plus 1. Well, I can factor\\nout the x plus 1. If I factor out an x plus 1,\\nthat's equal to x plus 1 times 6x plus that 1. I'm just doing the distributive property in reverse. So hopefully you didn't\\nfind that too bad. And now, I'm going to actually\\nexplain why this little magical system actually works. Let me take an example. I'll do it in very\\ngeneral terms. Let's say I had ax plus b,\\ntimes cx-- actually, I'm afraid to use the a's and b's. I think that'll confuse\\nyou, because I use a's and b's here. They won't be the same thing. So let me use completely\\ndifferent letters. Let's say I have fx plus g,\\ntimes hx plus, I'll use j instead of i. You'll learn in the future\\nwhy don't like using i as a variable. So what is this going\\nto be equal to? Well, it's going to be fx\\ntimes hx which is fhx. And then, fx times j. So plus fjx. And then, we're going\\nto have g times hx. So plus ghx. And then g times j. Plus gj. Or, if we add these two middle\\nterms, you have fh times x, plus-- add these two terms--\\nfj plus gh x. Plus gj. Now, what did I do here? Well, remember, in all of these\\nproblems where you have a non-1 or non-negative 1\\ncoefficient here, we look for two numbers that add up to this,\\nwhose product is equal to the product of\\nthat times that. Well, here we have two numbers\\nthat add up-- let's say that a is equal to fj. That is a. And b is equal to gh. So a plus b is going to be\\nequal to that middle coefficient. And then what is a times b? a\\ntimes b is going to be equal to fj times gh. We could just reorder these\\nterms. We're just multiplying a bunch of terms. So that could\\nbe rewritten as f times h times g times j. These are all the same things. Well, what is fh times gj? This is equal to fh times gj. Well, this is equal to the first\\ncoefficient times the constant term. So a plus b will be equal to\\nthe middle coefficient. And a times b will equal the\\nfirst coefficient times the constant term. So that's why this whole\\nfactoring by grouping even works, or how we're able\\nto figure out what a and b even are. Now, I'm going to close up\\nwith something slightly different, but just to make\\nsure that you have a well-rounded education\\nin factoring things. What I want to do is to teach\\nyou to factor things a little bit more completely. And this is a little\\nbit of a add-on. I was going to make a\\nwhole video on this. But I think, on some level,\\nit might be a little obvious for you. So let's say we had-- let\\nme get a good one here. Let's say we had negative\\nx to the third, plus 17x squared, minus 70x. Immediately, you say, gee, this\\nisn't even a quadratic. I don't know how to solve\\nsomething like this. It has an x to third power. And the first thing you should\\nrealize is that every term here is divisible by x. So let's factor out an x. Or even better, let's factor\\nout a negative x. So if you factor out a negative\\nx, this is equal to negative x times-- negative\\nx to the third divided by negative x is x squared. 17x squared divided by negative\\nx is negative 17x. Negative 70x divided by negative\\nx is positive 70. The x's cancel out. And now, you have something\\nthat might look a little bit familiar. We have just a standard\\nquadratic where the leading coefficient is a 1. We just have to find two numbers\\nwhose product is 70, and that add up to\\nnegative 17.

And that'll get it into a form\\nthat you might recognize. Hopefully, you found\\nthis helpful. I want to reiterate what I\\nshowed you at the beginning of this video. I think it's a really cool\\ntrick, so to speak, to be able to factor things that have\\na non-1 or non-negative 1 leading coefficient.

       "  \"We're asked to factor 4y squared\\nplus 4y, minus 15. And whenever you have an\\nexpression like this, where you have a non-one coefficient\\non the y squared, or on the second degree term-- it could\\nhave been an x squared-- the best way to do this\\nis by grouping. And to factor by grouping we\\nneed to look for two numbers whose product is equal to\\n4 times negative 15. So we're looking for two numbers\\nwhose product-- let's call those a and b-- is going\\nto be equal to 4 times negative 15, or negative 60. And the sum of those two\\nnumbers, a plus b, needs to be equal to this 4 right there. So let's think about all the\\nfactors of negative 60, or 60. And we're looking for ones that\\nare essentially 4 apart, because the numbers are going\\nto be of different signs, because their product is\\nnegative, so when you take two numbers of different signs and\\nyou sum them, you kind of view it as the difference of\\ntheir absolute values. If that confuses you, don't\\nworry about it. But this tells you that the\\nnumbers, since they're going to be of different size, their\\nabsolute values are going to be roughly 4 apart. So we could try out things like\\n5 and 12, 5 and negative 12, because one has\\nto be negative. If you add these two you get\\nnegative 7, if you did negative 5 and 12 you'd\\nget positive 7. They're just still\\ntoo far apart. What if we tried 6\\nand negative 10? Then you get a negative 4,\\nif you added these two. But we want a positive 4, so\\nlet's do negative 6 and 10. Negative 6 plus 10\\nis positive 4. So those will be our two\\nnumbers, negative 6 and positive 10. Now, what we want to do\\nis we want to break up this middle term here. The whole point of figuring out\\nthe negative 6 and the 10 is to break up the 4y into\\na negative 6y and a 10y. So let's do that. So this 4y can be rewritten as\\nnegative 6y plus 10y, right? Because if you add\\nthose you get 4y. And then the other sides of it,\\nyou have your 4y squared, your 4y squared and then\\nyou have your minus 15. All I did is expand this into\\nthese two numbers as being the coefficients on the y. If you add these, you\\nget the 4y again. Now, this is where the\\ngrouping comes in. You group the term. Let me do it in a\\ndifferent color. So if I take these two guys,\\nwhat can I factor out of those two guys? Well, there's a common factor,\\nit looks like there's a common factor of 2y. So if we factor out 2y, we get\\n2y times 4y squared, divided by 2y is 2y. And then negative 6y divided\\nby 2y is negative 3. So this group gets factored\\ninto 2y times 2y, minus 3. Now, let's look at this other\\ngroup right here. This was the whole point about\\nbreaking it up like this. And in other videos I've\\nexplained why this works. Now here, the greatest\\ncommon factor is a 5. So we can factor out a 5, so\\nthis is equal to plus 5 times 10y, divided by 5 is 2y. Negative 15 divided\\nby five is 3. And so we have 2y times\\n2y minus 3, plus 5 times 2y minus 3. So now you have two terms,\\nand 2y minus 3 is a common factor to both. So let's factor out a 2y minus\\n3, so this is equal to 2y minus 3, times 2y, times\\nthat 2y, plus that 5. There's no magic happening\\nhere, all I did is undistribute the 2y minus 3. I factored it out of\\nboth of these guys. I took it out of the\\nparentheses. If I distribute it in, you'd get\\nback to this expression. But we're done, we\\nfactored it. We factored it into two\\nbinomial expressions. 4y squared plus 4y, minus\\n15 is 2y minus 3, times 2y plus 5. \"),\n",

       "  \"We need to factor negative 12f\\nsquared minus 38f, plus 22. So a good place to start is just\\nto see if, is there any common factor for all three\\nof these terms? When we look at them,\\nthey're all even. And we don't like a negative\\nnumber out here. So let's divide everything, or\\nlet's factor out a negative 2. So this expression right here is\\nthe same thing as negative 2 times-- what's negative 12f\\nsquared divided by negative 2? It's positive 6f squared. Negative 38 divided by negative\\n2 is positive 19, so it'll be positive 19f. And then 22 divided by negative\\n22-- oh, sorry, 22 divided by negative\\n2 is negative 11. So we've simplified it a bit. We have the 6f squared\\nplus 19f, minus 11. We'll just focus on that\\npart right now. And the best way to factor this\\nthing, since we don't have a 1 here as the coefficient\\non the f squared, is to factor it by grouping. So we need to look for two\\nnumbers whose product is 6 times negative 11. So two numbers, so a times b,\\nneeds to be equal to 6 times negative 11, or negative 66. And a plus b needs to\\nbe equal to 19. So let's try a few\\nnumbers here. So let's see, 22, I'm just\\nthinking of numbers that are roughly 19 apart, because\\nthey're going to be of different signs. So 22 and 3, I think\\nwill work. Right. If we take 22 times negative 3,\\nthat is negative 66, and 22 plus negative 3 is\\nequal to 19. And the way I kind of got pretty\\nclose to this number is, well, you know, they're\\ngoing to be of different signs, so the positive versions\\nof them have to be about 19 apart, and\\nthat worked out. 22 and negative 3. So now we can rewrite this 19f\\nright here as the sum of negative 3f and 22f. That's the same thing as 19f. I just kind of broke it apart. And, of course, we have the\\n6f squared and we have the minus 11 here. Now, you're probably saying, hey\\nSal, why did you put the 22 here and the negative\\n3 there? Why didn't you do it the\\nother way around? Why didn't you put the 22 and\\nthen the negative 3 there? And my main motivation for doing\\nit, I like to put the negative 3 on the same side with\\nthe 6 because they have the common factor of the 3. I like to put the 22 with the\\nnegative 11, they have the same common factor of 11. So that's why I decided\\nto do it that way. So now let's do the grouping. And, of course, you can't forget\\nthis negative 2 that we have sitting out here\\nthe whole time. So let me put that negative 2\\nout there, but that'll just kind of hang out for awhile. But let's do some grouping. So let's group these\\nfirst two. And then we're going to group\\nthis-- let me get a nice color here-- and then we're going\\nto group this second two. Well, that's almost an\\nidentical color. Let me do it in this\\npurple color. And then we can group that\\nsecond two right there. So these first two, we could\\nfactor out a negative 3f, so it's negative 3f times-- 6f\\nsquared divided by negative 3f is negative 2f. And then negative 3f divided\\nby negative 3f is just positive f. Actually, a better way to start,\\ninstead of factoring out a negative 3f, let's just\\nfactor out 3f, so we don't have a negative out here. We could do it either way. But if we just factor\\nout a 3f, 6f squared divided by 3f is 2f. And then negative 3f divided\\nby 3f is negative 1. So that's what that\\nfactors into. And then that second part, in\\nthat dark purple color, can factor out an 11. And if we factor that out, 22f\\ndivided by 11 is 2f, and negative 11 divided by\\n11 is negative 1. And, of course, once again,\\nyou have that negative 2 hanging out there. Now, inside the parentheses,\\nwe have two terms, both of which have 2f minus\\n1 as a factor. So we can factor that out. This whole thing is just an\\nexercise in doing the reverse distributive property,\\nif you will. So let's factor that out, so\\nyou have 2f minus 1, times this 3f, and then times\\nthat plus 11. Let me do that in the\\nsame shade of purple right over there. And you know, you can distribute\\nit if you like. 2f minus 1 times 3f will give\\nyou this term, 2f f minus 1 times 11 will give\\nyou that term. And we can't forget that we\\nstill have that negative 2 hanging out outside. I want to change the\\ncolors on it. And we're done factoring it.

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're now\\ngoing to explore factoring a type of expression called\\na difference of squares and the reason why it's\\ncalled a difference of squares is 'cause it's expressions\\nlike x squared minus nine. This is a difference. We're subtracting between two quantities that are each squares. This is literally x squared. Let me do that in a different color. This is x squared minus three squared. It's the difference between two quantities that have been squared and it turns out that this is pretty\\nstraightforward to factor. And to see how it can be factored, let me pause there for a second and get a little bit of review\\nof multiplying binomials. So put this on the back\\nburner a little bit. Before I give you the answer\\nof how you factor this, let's do a little bit of an exercise. Let's multiply x plus a times x minus a where a is some number. Now, we can use that, do that using either the FOIL method but I like just thinking of this as a distributive property twice. We could take x plus a and distribute it onto\\nthe x and onto the a. So when we multiply it by x, we would get x times x is x squared, a times x is plus ax and then when we multiply\\nit by the negative a, well, it'll become negative a times x minus a squared. So these middle two terms cancel out and you are left with x\\nsquared minus a squared. You're left with a difference of squares. x squared minus a squared. So we have an interesting\\nresult right over here that x squared minus\\na squared is equal to, is equal to x plus a, x plus a times x minus a. And so we can use, and this is for any a. So we could use this\\npattern now to factor this. Here, what is our a? Our a is three. This is x squared minus three squared or we could say minus our a\\nsquared if we say three is a and so to factor it, this\\nis just going to be equal to x plus our a which is three times x minus our a which is three. So x plus three times x minus three. Now, let's do some examples\\nto really reinforce this idea of factoring differences of squares. So let's say we want to factor, let me say y squared minus 25 and it has to be a difference of squares. It doesn't work with a sum of squares. Well, in this case, this is going to be y\\nand you have to confirm, okay, yeah, 25 is five squared and y squared is well, y squared. So this gonna be y plus\\nsomething times y minus something and what is that something? Well, this right here is five\\nsquared so it's y plus five times y minus five and the variable doesn't\\nhave to come first. We could write 121 minus, I'll introduce a new\\nvariable, minus b squared. Well, this is a difference of squares because 121 is 11 squared. So this is going to be 11 plus something times 11 minus something and in this case, that something is going to be\\nthe thing that was squared. So 11 plus b times 11 minus b. So in general, if you see\\na difference of squares, one square being subtracted\\nfrom another square and it could be a numeric perfect square or it could be a variable that\\nhas been squared that can be, that you could take the square root of. Well, then you could say, alright, well, that's just gonna be the first thing that squared plus the second\\nthing that has been squared times the first thing that was squared minus the second thing that was squared. Now, some common mistakes\\nthat I've seen people do including my son when\\nthey first learned this is they say, okay, it's easy to recognize the difference of squares but then they say, oh,\\nis this y squared plus 25 times y squared minus 25? No, the important thing to realize is is that what is getting squared? Over here, y is the thing getting squared and over here it is five\\nthat is getting squared. Those are the things\\nthat are getting squared in this difference of squares and so it's gonna be y plus\\nfive times y minus five. I encourage you to just try this out. We have a whole practice\\nsection on Khan Academy where you can do many many more\\nof these to become familiar. \"),\n",

       "  \"Let's see if we can\\nfactor the expression 45x squared minus 125. So whenever I see\\nsomething like this-- I have a second-degree\\nterm here, I have a subtraction\\nsign-- my temptation is to look at this as a\\ndifference of squares. We've already seen\\nthis multiple times. We've already seen that if\\nwe have something of the form a squared minus b squared, that\\nthis can be factored as a plus b times a minus b. So let's look over here. Well, over here,\\nit's not obvious that this right over\\nhere is a perfect square. Neither is it obvious\\nthat this right over here is a perfect square. So it's not clear\\nto me that this is a difference of squares. But what is interesting\\nis that both 45 and 125 have some factors in common. And the one that\\njumps out at me is 5. So let's see if we can factor\\nout a 5, and by doing that, whether we can get something\\nthat's a little bit closer to this pattern right over here. So if we factor out a 5,\\nthis becomes 5 times-- well, 45x squared divided by 5\\nis going to be 9x squared. And then 125 divided by 5 is 25. Now, this is interesting. 9x squared-- that's\\na perfect square. If we call this a\\nsquared, then that tells us that a\\nwould be equal to 3x. 3x-- the whole thing\\nsquared is 9x squared. Similarly-- I can never say\\nsimilarly correctly-- 25 is clearly just 5 squared. So in this case, if we're\\nlooking at this template, b would be equal to 5. So now this is a\\ndifference of squares, and we can factor it completely. So we can't forget our 5 out\\nfront that we factored out. So it's going to be\\n5 times a plus b. So let me write this. So it's going to be 5 times\\na plus b times a minus b. So let me write the b's\\ndown, plus b and minus b.

Fatu factored it this way. Which student wrote an\\nexpression that is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64? So I encourage you to pause\\nthe video and figure that out. Which student wrote an\\nexpression that is equivalent to our original one, 16 x-squared minus 64? Well let's work through it\\ntogether, so let's see if first we can factor this out\\nsomehow to get what Moussa got and it looks like Moussa\\nfirst factored out a 16 and then he was left with\\na difference of squares. So let's see if we can do that. So, we can write our original expression. 16 x-squared minus 64,\\nwe can write that as 16 times x-squared minus 16 times four. And when you write it like\\nthat, it's very clear that you can factor out a 16. So this is going to be equal to 16 times what you have left over is x-squared minus four and then x-squared minus four, that's a difference of\\nsquares right over there. So, that part we can factor as, so we have our original 16 and then... this part right over here, we can write as x plus two times x minus two. x plus two times x minus two. If what I just did in this\\nlast step, going from x-squared minus four to x plus two times x minus two doesn't make any sense, I\\nencourage you to watch some of the introductory videos on factoring and difference of squares. But the basic idea, I have a form here of a-squared minus b-squared, so\\nit's going to have the form of a plus b times a minus b and in this case it's\\nx-squared minus two squared. So it's going to be x plus\\ntwo times x minus two. So that's exactly what Moussa got. So this one, so Moussa, did get an expression\\nthat is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64. Now let's think about Fatu. So Fatu didn't factor\\nout a 16 from the get-go. It looks like he just\\nimmediately recognized that our original expression is\\nitself a difference of squares even if we don't factor out a 16, and so let's re-write it. So our original expression, we could write as, so instead of writing,\\nwell I'm just going to write it like this, this\\nis our original expression. 16 x-squared minus 64. That's the same thing as, 16\\nx-squared is the same thing as four x, the whole thing squared and then minus eight squared. So when you write it like\\nthis, it's clear that this is a difference of squares,\\nso this is going to be four x plus eight times\\nfour x minus eight. Four x plus eight times\\nfour x minus eight. Once again, if this last\\nstep that I did doesn't make a lot of sense I encourage\\nyou to watch the video on factoring difference\\nof squares where we go a lot more into the intuition of it. But when you see it this\\nway you realize that Fatu also got an expression\\nthat is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64, so they both did. \"),\n",

And like always pause the video and see if you can work through this. All right, now let's work\\nthrough this together and the way I am going to do this is I'm just going to try and\\nfactor both of them into the product of binomials and\\nmaybe some other things and see if we have any\\ncommon binomial factors. So first let's focus on m squared minus 4m minus 45. So let me write it over here, m squared minus 4m minus 45. So when you're factoring a\\nquadratic expression like this, where the coefficient\\non the, in this case, m squared term, on the\\nsecond degree term is one, we could factor it as being equal to m plus a, times m plus b, where a plus b is going to be equal to this coefficient right over here, and a times b is going to be equal to this coefficient right over here. So let's be clear, so, a, let me see another color, so a plus b needs to\\nbe equal to negative 4, a plus b needs to be equal to negative 4, and then a times b needs\\nto be equal to negative 45. A times b is equal to negative 45. Now I like to focus on the\\na times b and think about, well, what could a and b\\nbe to get to negative 45? Well if I'm taking the\\nproduct of two things and if the product is negative that means that they are going to have different signs and if when we add them we get a\\nnegative number that means that the negative one has a larger magnitude. So let's think about this a little bit. So a times b is equal to negative 45. So this could be, let's\\ntry some values out. So, 1 and 45, those are too far apart. Let's see. 3 and 15, those still\\nseem pretty far apart. Let's see, it looks like\\n5 and 9 seem interesting. So if we say, if we say 5 times, if we were to say, 5 times negative 9, that indeed is equal to negative 45, and 5 plus negative 9 is indeed equal to negative 4. So a could be equal to 5 and b could be equal to negative 9. And so if we were to factor\\nthis, this is going to be m plus 5, times m, I could say m plus negative 9, but I'll just write m minus 9. So just like that I've\\nbeen able to factor this first quadratic expression right over there as a product of two binomials. So now let's try to factor the\\nother quadratic expression. Let's try to factor 6m squared minus 150. And let's see, the first\\nthing I might want to do is, both 6m squared and 150, they're both divisible by 6. So let me write it this\\nway, I could write it as, 6m squared minus 6 times, let's see, 6 goes into 150, 25 times. So all I did is I rewrote this and really I just wrote 150 as 6 times 25. And now you can clearly see\\nthat we can factor out a 6. You can view this as undistributing the 6. So this is the same thing as 6 times m squared minus 25, which we recognize this is\\na difference of squares. So it's all going to be 6 times, m plus 5, times m minus 5. And so we've factored this out\\nas a product of binomials and a constant factor here, 6, and so, what is their shared, common or what is their common\\nbinomial factor that they share? Well you see when we factored\\nit out, they both have an m plus 5. So m plus 5 is the binomial factor that they share. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Narrator] We\\'re going to\\nlearn to recognize and factor perfect square polynomials in this video. So for example, say I have the polynomial x squared plus six x plus nine. And then someone asks you,\\n\"Hey, can you factor this \"into two binomials?\" Well, using techniques we\\nlearned in other videos, say, \"Okay, I need to find two numbers \"whose product is nine\\nand whose sum is six.\" And so I encourage you to\\npause this video and say, \"Well, what two numbers can add up to six, \"and if I take their product I get nine?\" Well, nine only has so many factors, really one, three, and nine. And one plus nine does not equal six. And so, and negative\\none plus negative nine does not equal six. But three times three equals nine, and three plus three does equal six. Three times three, three plus three. And so we can factor this as x plus three times x plus three, which is of course the same thing as x plus three squared. And so what was it about this expression that made us recognize, or maybe now we will start to recognize it as being a perfect square? Well, I have of course some\\nvariable that is being squared, which we need. I have some perfect square as a constant, and that whatever is being squared there, I have two times that as the coefficient on this first degree term here. Let\\'s see if that is generally true. And I\\'ll switch up the variables\\njust to show that we can. So let\\'s say that I have a\\nsquared plus 14 a plus 49. So a few interesting\\nthings are happening here. All right, I have my variable squared. I have a perfect square constant term, that is seven squared right over here. And my coefficient on my\\nfirst degree term here that is two times the\\nthing that\\'s being squared. That is two times seven, or you can say it\\'s seven plus seven. So you can immediately say, \"Okay, \"if I want to factor this, \"this is going to be\\na plus seven squared.\" And you can of course verify that by multiplying out, by figuring out what a\\nplus seven squared is. Sometimes when you\\'re first learning this, you\\'re like, \"Hey, isn\\'t\\nthat just a squared \"plus seven squared?\" No! Remember, this is the same thing as a plus seven times a plus seven. And you can calculate this by using the foil, F-O-I-L technique. I don\\'t like that so much because you\\'re not thinking mathematically about what\\'s happening. Really you just have to do\\ndistributive property twice here. First you can multiply\\na plus seven times a. So a plus seven times a. And then multiply a\\nplus seven times seven. So plus a plus seven times seven, and so this is going to\\nbe a squared plus seven a, plus, now we distribute the seven. Plus seven a plus 49. So now you see where that 14 a came from. It\\'s from the seven a plus the seven a. You see where the a squared came from. And you see where the 49 came from. And you can speak of this\\nin more general terms. If I wanted to just take the expression a plus b and square it, that\\'s just a plus b times a plus b, and we do exactly what we did just here, but here I\\'m just doing\\nin very general terms with a or b and you can think of a as either a constant number or even a variable. And so this is going to\\nbe, if we distribute this, it\\'s going to be a plus b times that a plus a plus b times that b. And so this is going to be a squared, now I\\'m just doing the\\ndistributive property again. A squared plus ab plus ab plus b squared. So it\\'s a squared plus\\ntwo ab plus b squared. So this is going to be the general form. So if a is the variable, which\\nwas x, or a in this case, then it\\'s just going\\nto be whatever squared and the constant term is\\ngoing to be two times that times the variable. And I want to show that\\nthere\\'s some variation that you can entertain here. So if you were to see 25\\nplus 10x plus x squared, and someone wanted you, said \"Hey, why don\\'t you factor that?\" we could say, \"Look, this\\nright here is a perfect square. \"It\\'s five squared. \"I have the variable\\nsquared right over here, \"and then this coefficient\\non our first degree term \"is two times five.\" And so you might immediately\\nrecognize this as five plus x squared. Now of course you could\\njust rewrite this polynomial as x squared plus 10 x plus 25 in which case you might say,\\n\"Okay, variable squared, \"some number squared, five squared, \"two times that number\\nis the coefficient here. \"So that\\'s going to be\\nx plus five squared.\" And that\\'s good because these two things are absolutely equivalent.

For this middle\\nterm to work out-- I'm trying to look for good\\ncolors-- 2ab, this part right over here, needs to\\nbe equal to negative 30. Or another way-- let me write\\nit over here-- 2ab needs to be equal to negative 30. Or if we divide\\nboth sides by 2, ab needs to be equal\\nto negative 15. That tells us that the\\nproduct is negative. One has to be positive,\\nand one has to be negative. Now, lucky for us the\\nproduct of 5 and 3 is 15. If we make one of them positive\\nand one of them negative, we'll get up to negative 15. It looks like things\\nare going to work out. We could select a is\\nequal to positive 5, and b is equal to negative 3. Those would work out to ab\\nbeing equal to negative 15. Or we could make a is\\nequal to negative 5, and b is equal to positive 3. Either of these will work. If we factor this\\nout, this could be either a is negative--\\nlet's do this first one. It could either be a\\nis 5, b is negative 3. This could either be\\n5x minus 3 squared. a is 5, b is negative 3. It could be that. Or you could have-- we could\\nswitch the signs on the two terms. Or a could be negative 5,\\nand b could be positive 3. Or it could be negative\\n5x plus 3 squared. Either of these\\nare possible ways to factor this term out here. And you say wait, how\\ndoes this work out? How can both of these\\nmultiply to the same thing? Well, this term, remember,\\nthis negative 5x plus 3, we could factor\\nout a negative 1. So this right here is the same\\nthing as negative 1 times 5x minus 3, the whole\\nthing squared. And that's the same thing\\nas negative 1 squared times 5x minus 3 squared. And negative 1 squared\\nis clearly equal to 1. That's why this and\\nthis are the same thing. This comes out to the same\\nthing as 5x minus 3 squared, which is the same thing\\nas that over there. Either of these are\\npossible answers. \"),\n",

So let\\'s work through it. This is the same thing as multiplying AX plus B times AX plus B. So let me fill that in. This is AX there, another AX there. I just wrote it in that order to make the color switching\\na little bit easier. So AX plus B times AX plus B. Well, what\\'s that going to be equal to? Well, if you take this AX\\nand you multiply it times that AX, you\\'re going to get AX squared. AX, the entire thing squared. And then if you take, if you take this AX and then multiply it times this B, you\\'re going to get ABX. Then if you take this\\nB and you multiply it times this AX, you\\'re\\ngoing to get another ABX. ABX. And then last but not\\nleast, if you take this B and multiply it times the other B, it\\'s going to be plus B squared. And so what are you left with? Well, you\\'re going to be left with A, I\\'ll write it like this, AX squared, we actually if we want, well, I\\'ll write it in a\\ndifferent way in a second, and then you have plus, plus two, that\\'s a slightly different color. I\\'m gonna do that other color. Plus two ABX, and then finally plus B squared. Plus B squared. Now, I said I could write it\\nin a slightly different way, what I could do is just\\nrewrite-out AX squared as being the same thing. This is the same thing\\nas A-squared X-squared, and then I can write out\\neverything else the same way. Plus two ABX, and then plus B squared. Now, why did I, what\\'s\\ninteresting about doing this? Well, now we can see the pattern for the square of any binomial or binomial like this, so for example, if someone\\nwere to walk up to you and say \"alright, I have\\na trinomial of the form,\" let\\'s say they have a\\ntrinomial of the form 25X squared plus 20X plus 4, and they were to tell you to factor this, well, actually, let\\'s just do that. Why don\\'t you pause the video and see if you could factor this as\\nthe product of two binomials. Well, when you look at this, you\\'d say \"well look, there\\'s 25X squared, \"that looks like a perfect square. \"25X squared, that\\'s the\\nsame thing as five-squared \"x-squared,\" or you could write it as five X squared. This four here, that\\'s a perfect square. That\\'s the same thing as two squared. And let\\'s see, 20, right over here, if we want it to fit this pattern, we would see that A is five and B is two, and so let\\'s see, what\\nwould be two times AB? Well, five times two AB would be 10, and then two times that would be 20. So this right over here is, that is plus two times five. Two times five times two times two X. Times two X, I\\'ll do it in this color. Times two X. So you see that this completely\\nmatches this pattern here where A is equal to five\\nand B is equal to two. Once again, this is AX,\\nthe whole thing squared, then you have two times A times BX, you see that there, and then finally you have the B squared. So if you wanted to\\nfactor this, you could say \"well, this is just\\ngoing to the same thing \"since we know what A and B are, \"this is going to be five X plus two.\" Five X plus two. Five X plus two, whole thing squared. So the whole point of doing\\nthis is to start recognizing when we actually have perfect squares, especially perfect squares\\nwhere the leading coefficient isn\\'t one. '),\n",

When you look at them, well\\nthese first two are divisible by 4, these last 2 are divisible\\nby 3, but not all of them are divisible\\nany one number. Will, but you could factor out\\na negative 1, but even if you factor out a negative 1-- so you\\nsay this is the same thing as negative 1, times positive\\n4t squared plus 12t plus 9-- you still end up with a non-one\\ncoefficient out here and on the second degree term,\\non the t squared term. So you might want\\nto immediately start grouping this. And if you did factor it by\\ngrouping, it would work, you would get the right answer. But there is something about\\nthis equation that might pop out at you that might make it a\\nlittle bit simpler to solve. And to understand that, let's\\ntake a little bit of a break here on the right hand side,\\nand just think about what happens if you take a plus b\\ntimes a plus b, if you just have a binomial squared. Well you have a times a,\\nwhich is a squared. Then you have a times that\\nb, which is plus ab. Then you have b times a, which\\nis the same thing is ab. And then you have b times b,\\nor you have b squared. And so if you add these middle\\ntwo terms, right here, you're left with a squared plus\\n2ab plus b squared. This is the square\\nof a binomial. Now, does this right here, does\\n4t squared plus 12t plus 9 fit this pattern? Well the 4t squared\\nis a squared. So this right here\\nis a squared. If that is a squared right\\nthere, then what does a have to be? If this is a squared, then a\\nwould be equal to the square root of this. It would be 2t. And if this is b squared,\\nlet me do that in a different color. If this right here is b\\nsquared, if the 9 is b squared, right there,\\nthen that means that b is equal to 3. It's equal to the positive\\nsquare root of the 9. Now, this number, right here--\\nand actually it doesn't have to just be equal to 3,\\nit might have been negative 3 as well. It could be plus or minus 3. But this number here,\\nis it 2 times ab? Right? That's the middle term\\nthat we care about. Is it 2 times ab? Well if we multiply 2t\\ntimes 3, we get 6t. And then if we multiply that\\ntimes 2, you get 12t. This right here, 12t, is equal\\nto 2 times 2t times 3. It is 2 times ab. And if this was a negative 3,\\nwe would look to see if this was a negative 12, but this\\ndoes work for positive 3. So this it does fit the pattern\\nof a perfect square. This is a square\\nof a binomial. So if you wanted to factor\\nthis-- the stuff on the inside, you still have that\\nnegative 1 out there, the 4t squared plus 12t plus 9-- you\\ncould immediately say, well that's going to be a plus\\nb times a plus b. Or 2t plus 3 times 2t plus 3, or\\nyou could just say, it's 2t plus 3 squared. It fits this pattern. And, of course, you can't\\nforget about this negative 1 out here. You could have also solved it by\\ngrouping, but this might be a quicker thing to recognize. This is a number squared. That's another number squared. If you take each of those\\nnumbers that you're squaring, take their product and multiply\\nit by 2, you have that right there. So this is a perfect square. \"),\n",

What I wanna figure out in this video is what is c, given the information that we have right over here? What is c going to be equal to? And what is d going to be equal to? Like always, pause the video and see if you can figure it out. Let's work through this together. We're saying that x-squared\\nplus five x plus c can be rewritten as x plus d-squared. Let me write that down. So this part, this part, x-squared plus five x plus c, we're saying that, that could be written as x plus d-squared. This is equal to x plus d-squared. Now we can rewrite, x plus d-squared is going to be equal to x-squared plus two dx plus d-squared. If this step, right over\\nhere, you find strange, I encourage you to watch the videos on squaring binomials or on\\nperfect square polynomials, either one, so you can see the pattern that this is going to be.

And I encourage you to pause the video, see if you can figure it out. So, let\\'s do this by taking\\neach of these expressions, and trying to factor them into binomials, and then see if they share\\na common binomial factor. I guess they do share\\none, it\\'s to figure out which one they actually share. So, let\\'s focus first on this\\n4x squared, plus 12x, plus 9. So, the first thing that\\nmight jump out at you is, well let\\'s see, I have a\\n4 here, this coefficient on the x squared term,\\nthat\\'s a perfect square. I could write the entire 4x squared term, I could rewrite that\\nas 2x to the 2nd power, then out here, I have\\na constant term, the 9, that also is a perfect square. I could rewrite that as 3 squared. And you could say, \"Well,\\ngee, does this fit the pattern of a perfect square polynomial?\" In order for it to fit the pattern of a perfect square polynomial, the coefficient, here on the x term, would need to be 2 times the\\nproduct of this 2 and this 3, and it is, indeed, 2 times\\nthe product of 2 and 3. It is 2 times 6, so we\\ncould write this part, right over here, as 2 times 2, times that 2,\\ntimes 3, times that 3x, x. Then of course, we have to add\\nthese three things together, so plus, plus. And so just like that, we can recognize, hey, this is\\na perfect square polynomial, right over here. And if what I\\'m saying, right now, sounds like a little bit of voodoo, I encourage you to\\nwatch some of the videos on perfect square trinomials,\\nperfect square polynomials, some of the last two\\nvideos in this progression. So this this thing can be rewritten as the same thing as 2x\\nplus 3, 2x plus 3, squared, 2x plus 3, squared. Once again, because it\\'s of the form, you have the entire 2x squared here, you have the 3 squared here, and then this middle term\\nis 2 times the product of these two terms right over here, and so it definitely fit the pattern. So, there you have it. We factored the first expression, and now let\\'s try to factor\\nthe second expression. And, immediately when you see this one, it looks like it\\'s a\\ndifference of squares, so this one right over there, looks like a difference of squares to me. This, we can rewrite as 2x squared, minus, minus, look at that\\nnice color, minus 3 squared, so minus 3 squared. This is a difference of squares,\\nwe\\'ve seen multiple times, how to factor difference of squares. If this, again, looks foreign to you, I encourage you to watch those videos, and we explain how that\\nworks, and why it works. What is is going to be, when you have something in the form A squared, minus B squared, it\\'s going to be equal to\\nA plus B, times A minus B. So, this is going to be equal to, let me just put the two\\nbinomials right over here, so this is going to be A\\nplus B, times A minus B. So, this is going to be 2x\\nplus 3, times 2x minus 3. So, 2x plus 3, times 2x minus 3. And so, what is their\\ncommon binomial factor? Well, they both involve,\\nwhen you factor them out, they both have a binomial\\nfactor of 2x plus 3. This one right over here,\\nwe could rewrite if we want. We could rewrite it as 2x\\nplus 3, times 2x plus 3. That might\\'ve been somewhat\\nobvious to you already. So, 2x, 2x, then you have plus 3, plus 3, these two are equivalent. And so you see, we see, that\\nwe share in both of these, we share at least one,\\nor we share exactly one, 2x plus 3, so that\\'s the\\nbinomial factor that they share: 2x plus 3. '),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We have other videos on individual techniques\\nfor factoring quadratics, but what I would like to do in this video is get some practice figuring out which technique to use, so I'm gonna write a bunch of quadratics, and I encourage you to pause the video, try to see if you can factor that quadratic yourself before I work through it with you. So the first quadratic\\nis 6x squared plus 3x. So pause and see if you can factor this. So this one might jump out at you that both of these terms\\nhere have a common factor. Both of them are divisible by three, six is divisible by three and so is three, and both of them are divisible by x, so you can factor out a 3x. So if you factor out a 3x, 6x squared divided by 3x, you're gonna\\nhave a 2x left over there and then 3x divided by 3x,\\nyou're going to have a one. And that's about as much as we can actually factor, and you can verify that these two expressions are the same if you distribute the 3x,\\n3x times 2x is 6x squared, 3x times one is 3x, and\\nthat's all we would do. We would be done. That's all you can\\nreally do to factor that. And as we'll see, in this example, trying to factor out a common factor was all we had to do, but as we'll see in future examples, that's\\nusually a good first step. Do all of, check whether the terms have a common factor, and if they do it never hurts to factor that out. So let's do another example. Let's say I have the quadratic\\n4x squared minus 4x minus 48. Pause the video and try to\\nfactor that as much as you can. Alright, so the first thing\\nyou might have noticed is that there is a common\\nfactor amongst the terms. All of them are divisible by four. Four is clearly divisible by four and 48 is also divisible by four. So let's factor a four out. This would be the same thing as four times x squared minus x minus 12. I just divided each of these\\nby four and I factored it out. You can distribute the four and verify that these two expressions are the same. Now are we done? Well no, we can factor what we have inside the parentheses, we\\ncan factor this further. Now how would we do that? So over here the key realization is alright, I have a one as a coefficient on my second degree term. I've written it in standard form where I have the second degree and then if there's a first degree term, and then I have my constant term or my zero degree term, and if I have a one coefficient right over here then I say, okay, are there two numbers whose sum equals the coefficient on the first degree term, on the x term, so are there two numbers\\nthat add up to negative one? You didn't see a one here\\nbefore but it's implicit there. Negative x is the same\\nthing as negative 1x. So are there two numbers, a plus b, that is equal to negative one and whose product is equal to negative 12? This is a technique that\\nwe do in other videos, and here the key is to realize that hey, maybe we can use it here. So a times be is equal to negative 12. And there's a couple of\\nkey realizations here. It's like, okay, if I have two numbers and their product is\\ngoing to be a negative that means one of them, that means they're gonna have different signs. One's going to be positive and\\none's going to be negative. If they had the same sign\\nthen this would be positive. So let's think about the factors of 12, and especially think about them in terms of different sign combinations. So you could think about one and 12, and whether you're\\nthinking about negative one and 12, negative one plus\\n12 would be positive 11. If you went the other way around, if you went negative 12 and\\none it would be negative 11, but either way that doesn't work. Two and six, negative two and six would be four, negative six and two would be negative four,\\nso that doesn't work. Three and four. Let's see, negative three and four would be positive one, but three and negative four works out. You add these two together, you take their product, you clearly get negative 12 and then you add them\\ntogether, you get negative one. So we can write inside the parentheses, so let me write, so this is gonna be four times, so we can factor\\nthat as two binomials. The first is going to be x plus, the first is going to be x plus three and then the next is going to be, we could say x plus negative four or we could say x minus\\nfour, and we're done. And if any of this seems\\nintimidating to you I encourage you to watch the videos on introduction to factoring polynomials. The key here is to recognize the method. So once again, at first try to factor out any common factors. We did that in both examples. And then we saw here, hey if we have a leading one coefficient here on the second degree term and we have it written in standard form, well let's think of two numbers that add up to this coefficient and whose product is equal to the constant\\nterm, and in this case it was three and negative four, we were able to factor it this way. We prove that in other videos. Let's do another example. We can't get enough\\npractice, and like always, pause the video and see if you\\ncan work through it yourself. Three x squared, plus 30, plus 75. Alright, I'm assuming you had a go at it. So you might immediately see that all of the terms are divisible by three, so let's factor three\\nout, so it's gonna be three times x squared plus, oh whoops, this should be an x here, my apologies. Pause the video again and\\nsee if you can do it (laughs) now that I wrote the\\nactual right thing there. So as you imagine it's nice to factor out a three first, so it's\\nthree times x squared, plus 10x, plus 25, and so you might immediately say alright, let's use the technique we had here. We have a leading one coefficient, it's written in standard form. Can I think of two numbers\\nthat add up to ten, so a plus b is equal to\\n10, and whose product, a times b, is equal to 25? And this would work. And if you look at the factors of 25 you'd say, alright, well this thing here is positive, this is positive, so I'm dealing with two positive numbers and to get 25 it's either a one and 25 or five and five, and\\nfive and five match this. Five plus five is equal to 10. Five times five is equal to 25. And so just using the exact technique we just did, you'd say\\nokay this is three times and the stuff in parentheses would be x plus five times x plus five, or you could say three\\ntimes x plus five squared. So some of you might\\nhave immediately said, well I don't have to do\\nthat exact technique. I could have immediately recognized this as a perfect square\\nbecause I have a square constant right over here, and that's a good sign that hey,\\nmaybe I should explore whether this is going to be\\na perfect square polynomial. So this is a perfect square, and if I were to take the square root of\\nit, and this coefficient is twice that square root, well that's a good sign that I'm probably dealing, or that I am dealing\\nwith a perfect square. But either way, whether you recognize it as a perfect square or\\nwhether you use the technique that we used in the second problem, either one of those would get\\nyou to the appropriate answer. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Sal] In the last video we looked at three different\\nexamples, really as a bit of a review of some of\\nour factoring techniques, and also to appreciate when\\nwe might wanna apply them. We saw in the first\\nexample that it was just a process of recognizing a common factor. Once we factored that out, we were done. In the second example, there\\nwas a common factor, four. Then, after that, we used, you could say, our most basic factoring technique, or one of our more basic\\nfactoring techniques, where we say, what two numbers add up to the first-degree coefficient, and then their product is the constant. And we were able to factor the expression. Then, in the third\\nexample, we, once again, started off by factoring\\nout a common value, which, in this case, was three. We could\\'ve done it the same\\nway we did the second one, or we could\\'ve immediately recognized that this is a perfect-square polynomial. But either way, we were able\\nto factor the expression. Let\\'s keep going to see if we\\ncan tackle some other types of polynomials that might\\nrequire some other techniques. Let\\'s say we have the expression seven x squared minus 63. Like always, pause this video, and see if you can factor that. I\\'ve intentionally designed\\nall of these so that you can check whether there\\'s a\\ncommon factor across the terms, and here they\\'re all divisible by seven. If you factor out a seven, you\\'re gonna get seven times x-squared minus nine. You might immediately recognize this as a difference of squares. You have x squared minus\\nthis right over here is three squared. Minus three squared. If the term difference of\\nsquares or how to factor them is completely foreign to\\nyou, I encourage you to watch the videos on factoring\\ndifference of squares or do a search on Khan Academy\\nfor difference of squares. But you will see, when you have a difference of squares like this, it can be factored as seven,\\nthis is just a seven out front, and then this part right over\\nhere, get a different color, this part right over here can be written as x plus three times x minus three. It is x squared minus three squared. Now, one thing to appreciate. This really isn\\'t a different technique than the one that we saw\\nin the previous video. If we just focused on\\nx squared minus nine, you could view this as x\\nsquared plus zero x minus nine. In that case, you\\'d say:\\n\"OK, what two numbers \"get me a product of negative\\nnine and add up to zero?\" If I need to get a\\nproduct of negative nine, that means that they\\nmust be different signs, a positive and a negative; otherwise, if they were the same sign,\\nyou\\'d get a positive here. So they\\'re different signs. Nine only has three factors. One. You could either have one and nine. There\\'s only two combinations here. You could either have one or\\nnine, and three and three. And, if you make one\\nnegative or nine negative, that\\'s not going to add up to zero. But if you make one of\\nthese threes negative, that does add up to zero. Say, OK, my two numbers are gonna be negative three and three. So it\\'s gonna be x minus\\nthree times x plus three. Once again, I\\'m just focusing on what was inside the parentheses\\nright over here. You\\'d put that seven out front if we were doing this\\nexact same expression. But if you recognize it as\\na difference of squares, it might happen for you\\na little bit faster. Let\\'s do one more example. Let\\'s say that I have two x\\nsquared plus seven x plus three. In general, when my coefficient on the second-degree\\nterm here is not a one, I try to see is there\\na common factor here. But, seven isn\\'t divisible\\nby two, and neither is three. So I can\\'t use the techniques that I used in the last few videos or even over here, where I say: \"Oh,\\nthere\\'s a common factor\", and get a leading coefficient of one. If you see a situation like that, it\\'s a clue that factoring\\nby grouping might apply here. Factoring by grouping. On some level, everything\\nthat we\\'ve just done now you could view as special\\ncases of factoring by grouping. Factoring by grouping, you say, OK, can I think of two numbers that\\nadd up to this coefficient. a plus b is equal to seven. a times b, instead of just\\nsaying it needs to equal to three, it actually needs to\\nbe equal to three times this, three times the leading coefficient, the coefficient on the x-squared term. It needs to be equal to three times two. If you think about it, we\\'ve\\nalways been doing that. The other examples we gave, the leading coefficient was a one. When you took the constant term,\\nand multiplied it by a one, you were just saying a times b needs to be equal to that constant term. If you wanna talk about it more generally, it should be a times b\\nshould be the constant term times the leading coefficient. In the introduction to\\nfactoring by grouping we explained why that works. You should never just accept\\nthis as some magic formula. It makes sense for a very\\ngood mathematical reason. But once you accept that, then it\\'s useful to be able\\nto apply the technique. So can we think of two\\nnumbers that add up to seven and whose product is equal to six? They\\'re going to have to be the same sign since this is a positive value. And, they\\'re gonna be positive\\n\\'cause they\\'re the same sign, and if they\\'re adding\\nup to a positive value, they\\'re both gonna be positive. Well, let\\'s see, one\\nand six seems to work. One plus six is seven. One times six is six. In factoring by grouping\\nwe rewrite our expression where we break this up\\nbetween the a and the b. So I can rewrite this as two x squared plus six x plus, I could write one x. Actually, lemme just do that. Plus one x plus three. As you can see, the\\nseven x, different color, the seven x has been broken\\nup into the six x and one x. That whole exercise I\\njust did is to see how we can break up this first-degree\\nterm right over here. But then, what\\'s useful\\nabout this, is now, we can do the reverse of the\\ndistributive property twice. So, for these first two terms, in a different color than I just use, these first two terms,\\nyou see a common factor. Two x squared and six x,\\nthey\\'re both divisible by two x. So let\\'s factor out a two x\\noutta those first two terms. If you do that, two x\\nsquared divided by two x, you\\'re just gonna have an x left over. Six x divided by two x, you\\'re\\njust going to have a three. And then you have plus. Over here, this is a\\nspecial situation where, x plus three, there is no common\\nfactor between x and three, so we\\'ll just rewrite that, x plus three. When I put a parentheses on it, which is equivalent to writing\\nit without a parentheses, you might see something else. I can undistribute, or I can\\nfactor out, an x plus three. What happens if I do that? I\\'m gonna get an x plus three. And then I\\'m gonna have\\nleftover in this term, if I factored out an x plus three, I\\'m just gonna have a two x left over. Two x. And then, this term, if I\\nfactor out an x plus three, I\\'m just gonna have a one left over. Plus one. Lemme do it in that same color. Having trouble switching colors today. Two x plus one. And we are done. So, as I said, these are\\nall various techniques. On some level, factoring by grouping is sometimes viewed as the hardest one. But I\\'ll say hard in parentheses because everything we did is\\njust a variation, really, a special case, of factoring by grouping. As you can see, it\\'s all about, two numbers that add up\\nto that middle coefficient on the first-degree term when\\nit\\'s written in standard form. Their product is equal to the product of the constant and the\\nleading coefficient. If you do that, you\\nbreak it up, it works out quite nicely where you\\nkeep factoring out terms. This one, on some levels,\\nwas a little bit more subtle, \\'cause you had to recognize\\nthat this x plus three has a one coefficient on there implicitly. One times x plus three is the\\nsame thing as x plus three. And then see that you can\\nfactor out an x plus three outta both of these terms,\\nand then, once you do that, you\\'re gonna be left\\nwith the two x plus one. But all of these, if you\\nreally feel comfortable with this arsenal of techniques, you\\'re gonna do pretty well. Frankly, if none of these work, well, you might already be familiar\\nwith the quadratic formula or you might be soon to learn it, but that\\'s when the quadratic\\nformula might be effective if none of these techniques work.

       "  \"- [Instructor] In this video,\\nwe are going to talk about one of the most common types\\nof curves you will see in mathematics, and that is the parabola. The word parabola sounds\\nquite fancy, but we'll see it's describing something that\\nis fairly straightforward. Now in terms of why it\\nis called the parabola, I've seen multiple explanations for it. It comes from Greek para, that root word, similar to parable. You could view of something beside, alongside, something in parallel. Bola, same root as when we're talking about ballistics, throwing something. So you could interpret\\nit as beside, alongside, something that is being thrown. Now how does that relate\\nto curves like this? Well my brain immediately\\nimagines this is the trajectory, this is the path that is a\\npretty good approximation for the path of things\\nthat are actually thrown. When you study physics, you will see the path, you'll approximate, the paths of objects being\\nthrown, as parabolas, so maybe that's where it comes from, but there are other potential explanations for why it is actually\\ncalled the parabola. It has been lost to history. But what exactly is a parabola? In future videos, we're gonna describe it a little bit more algebraically. In this one, we just wanna get a sense for what parabolas look\\nlike and introduce ourselves to some terminology around a parabola. These three curves, they\\nare all hand-drawn versions of a parabola, and so\\nyou immediately notice some interesting things about them. Some of them are opened\\nupwards like this yellow one and this pink one, and some\\nof them are open downwards. You will hear people say\\nthings like open, opened down, open downwards or open\\ndown or open upwards, so it's good to know what\\nthey are talking about, and it's, hopefully,\\nfairly self-explanatory. Open upwards, the parabola is open towards the top of our graph paper. Here it's open towards the\\nbottom of our graph paper. This looks like a right-side up U. This looks like an upside\\ndown U right over here. This pink one would be open upwards. Now another term that\\nyou'll see associated with the parabola, and\\nonce again, in the future, we'll learn how to calculate these things and find them precisely, is the vertex. The vertex you should view as the maximum or minimum point on a parabola. So if a parabola opens upwards\\nlike these two on the right, the vertex is the minimum point. The vertex is the minimum\\npoint right over there, and so if someone said what is the vertex of this yellow parabola? Well it looks like the x,\\nlooks like the x coordinate is three and a half, so\\nit is three and a half. It looks like the y\\ncoordinate, it looks like it is about negative three and a half. Once again, once we start\\nrepresenting these things with equations, we'll have techniques for calculating them more\\nprecisely, but the vertex of this other upward-opening parabola, it is the minimum point. It is the low point. There is no maximum point on\\nan upward-opening parabola. It just keeps increasing as x gets larger in the positive or the negative direction. Now if your parabola opens downward, then your vertex is going\\nto be your maximum point. Now related to the idea\\nof a vertex is the idea of an axis of symmetry. In general when we're talking\\nabout, well not just three, two dimensions but even three dimensions, but especially in two dimensions,\\nyou can imagine a line over which you can flip the graph, and so it meets, it folds onto itself. The axis of symmetry for this\\nyellow graph right over here, for this yellow parabola,\\nit would be this line. I'm gonna have to draw\\nit a little bit better. It would be that line right over there. You could fold the\\nparabola over that line, and it would meet itself. And that line, I didn't\\ndraw it as neat as I should, that should go directly\\nthrough the vertex, so to describe that line you'd say that line is x is equal to 3.5. Similarly the axis of symmetry\\nfor this pink parabola, it should go through the\\nline x equals negative one, so let me do that. That's the axis of symmetry. It goes through the\\nvertex, and if you were to fold the parabola over\\nit, it would meet itself. The axis of symmetry for this green one? It should, once again,\\ngo through the vertex. It looks like it is x is\\nequal to negative six. This is, let me write that down, that is the axis of symmetry. Now another concept that\\nisn't unique to parabolas, but we'll talk a lot about it\\nin the context of parabolas, are intercepts, so when\\npeople say y-intercept, and you saw this when\\nyou first graphed lines, they're saying where is the graph, where does the curve intercept\\nor intersect the y-axis? So the y-intercept of this\\nyellow line would be right there. It looks like it's the\\npoint zero comma three, zero comma three. The y-intercept for the pink\\none is right over there. At least on this graph paper,\\nwe don't see the y-intercept, but it eventually will\\nintersect the y-axis. It just will be way off of this screen. You might also be familiar\\nwith the term x-intercept, and that's especially\\ninteresting with parabolas as we'll see in the future. X-intercept is where do you intercept or intersect the x-axis? Here this yellow one you\\nsee it does it two places, and this is where it gets interesting. Lines will only intersect\\nthe x-axis once at most, but here we see that a\\nparabola can intersect the x-axis twice, because\\nit curves back around to intersect it again, and so for here the x-intercepts are going to be the point one comma zero and six comma zero. You might already notice\\nsomething interesting. The x-intercepts are symmetric\\naround the axis of symmetry, so they should be equal distant\\nfrom that axis of symmetry, and you can see they indeed are. They are both exactly two and a half away from that axis of symmetry,\\nand so if you know where the intercepts are,\\nyou just take, you could say, the midpoint of the x\\ncoordinates, and then you're going to have the axis of\\nsymmetry, the x coordinate of the axis of symmetry\\nand the x coordinate of the actual vertex. Similarly the x-intercept\\nhere looks like it's negative, the points are negative seven comma zero and negative five comma zero, and the x coordinate of the\\nvertex, or the line of symmetry, is right in between those two points. It's worth noting not\\nevery parabola is going to intersect the x-axis. Notice this pink upward-opening parabola, it's low point is above the x-axis, so it's never going to\\nintersect the actual x-axis, so this is actually not going\\nto have any x-intercepts. I'll leave you there. Those are actually the core\\nideas or the core visual themes around parabolas, and\\nwe're going to discuss them in a lot more detail when we\\nrepresent them with equations. As you'll see, these equations are going to involve second-degree terms. So the most simple parabola is going to be y is equal to x squared, but then you can\\ncomplicate it a little bit. You could have things like y is equal to two x squared minus five x plus seven. These types that we'll talk\\nabout in more general terms, these types of equations\\nsometimes called quadratics, they are represented,\\ngenerally, by parabolas. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're told that Adam flew his remote controlled\\ndrone off of a platform. The function f models\\nthe height of the drone above the ground, in meters, as a function of time, in\\nseconds, after takeoff. So what they want us\\nto do is plot the point on the graph of f that corresponds to each of the following things. So pause the video and\\nsee if you can do that, and, obviously, you can't\\ndraw on your screen. This is from an exercise on Khan Academy, but you can visually look at it, and even with your\\nfinger, point to the part of the graph of f that\\nrepresents each of these things. All right, so the first thing here is the height of the platform. So the drone is at the\\nheight of the platform right when it takes off, 'cause it says Adam flew\\nhis remote controlled drone off of a platform. So what is the time that he's taking off, the drone, or the drone is taking off? Well, that's going to\\nbe at time t equals zero right over here. And what is the height of\\nthe drone at that moment? It is 60 meters. So that must be the\\nheight of the platform. So that point right over there tells us the height of the platform. And if they asked us what the\\nheight of the platform is, it would be 60 meters. The next one is the\\ndrone's maximum height. So then as time goes on, we can see the drone starts going to a higher and higher and higher height, gets as high as 80 meters. And then it starts going down. So it looks like 80\\nmeters, at time 10 seconds, the drone hits a maximum\\nheight of 80 meters. And then last but not least, they say the time when the\\ndrone landed on the ground. Now, we can assume that the ground is when the height of the\\ndrone is at zero meters, and we can see that that\\nhappens right over here. And that happens at time\\nt equals 30 seconds. And so we've just marked it off, and I know what some of\\nyou all are thinking. Wait, there's another time where the drone's height is at zero, and that's right over here. That's at negative 10 seconds. Couldn't we say that that's also a time when the drone landed on the ground? And this is a important point to realize, because if we're really trying to model the drone's behavior from time t equals zero, if t equals zero is\\nright when you take off all the way to it lands, then this parabola that we're\\nshowing right over here, it actually, we would probably want to restrict its domain to positive times. And so this negative time\\nregion right over here really doesn't make a lot of sense. We should probably consider\\nthe non-negative values of time when we're trying to think about these different thins. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Katie\\nthrows a ball in the air for her dog to chase. The function f models the\\nheight of the ball, in meters, as a function of time, in\\nseconds, after Katie threw it. And we could see that right over here. This is our function f. So at time t equals zero, the height looks like\\nit's a couple of meters. And then as we go forward in time, to a little under 2 1/2\\nseconds, the ball's going up. And then after a little\\nunder 2 1/2 seconds, the ball starts going down. And after, by the time you get to five seconds or close to five seconds, it looks like the ball is on the ground. Its height is zero meters. So then they ask us which of these statements are true? Choose all that apply. So pause this video, and\\nsee if you can work it out. All right, now let's\\nlook through the choices. So the first one says Katie threw the ball from a height of five meters. So let's see if that bears fruit or (chuckles) see if that's true. So if she threw it from\\na height of five meters, that means that the y-intercept would've been at five meters. At time t equals zero, we would've been at a\\nheight of five meters. Clearly, that is not the y-intercept. It looks like she threw it from a height of maybe 1 1/2 or two meters. So I'm assuming that Katie\\nis not five meters tall. So she wasn't on a ladder or anything. She just threw it from her regular height. And so we can rule out this first choice. The second one says at its highest point, the ball was about 31\\nmeters above the ground. Let's see if that is true. So the highest point is right over here. And yeah, that looks about 31 meters, so I like that choice. So I will select that one. The ball was in the air\\nfor about 2 1/2 seconds. So we can clearly see\\nthat that is not the case. The ball was going up for about 2 1/2 seconds,\\nbut then it was going down for roughly another 2 1/2 seconds. And so it was actually in the\\nair for almost five seconds. So I would rule this one out. The ball reached its\\nhighest point in the air about 2 1/2 seconds after Katie threw it. So let's see, after Katie, 2 1/2 seconds after Katie threw the ball, it's right over there. It looks like it reached its highest point a little bit before that. But they said about, so they're\\nspeaking in rough terms. So I think that statement can be true. It's about 2 1/2 seconds. If they said exactly 2 1/2 seconds, I wouldn't have selected it\\n'cause it seems like it happened at like 2.45 seconds\\nor something like that. But there you go, those are\\nthe ones that seem true. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Instructor] Let\\'s say\\nthat we\\'ve got the equation two X minus one times X plus four is equal to zero. Pause this video and see\\nif you can figure out the X values that would\\nsatisfy this equation, essentially our solutions\\nto this equation. Alright, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. So at first, you might be tempted to multiply these things out, or there\\'s multiple ways that you might have tried to approach it, but the key realization here is that you have two\\nthings being multiplied, and it\\'s being equal to zero. So you have the first\\nthing being multiplied is two X minus one. This is expression is being multiplied by X plus four, and to get it to be equal to zero, one or both of these expressions needs to be equal to zero. Let me really reinforce that idea. If I had two variables, let\\'s say A and B, and I told you A times B is equal to zero. Well, can you get the\\nproduct of two numbers to equal zero without at least one of them being equal to zero? And the simple answer is no. If A is seven, the only way that you would get zero is if B is zero, or if B was five, the only way to get zero is if A is zero. So you see from this example, either, let me write this down, either A or B or both, \\'cause zero times zero is zero, or both must be zero. The only way that you get the\\nproduct of two quantities, and you get zero, is if one or both of\\nthem is equal to zero. I really wanna reinforce this idea. I\\'m gonna put a red box around it so that it really gets\\nstuck in your brain, and I want you to think about why that is. Try to come up with two numbers. Try to multiply them so that you get zero, and you\\'re gonna see\\nthat one of those numbers is going to need to be zero. So we\\'re gonna use this\\nidea right over here. Now this might look a\\nlittle bit different, but you could view two\\nX minus one as our A, and you could view X plus four as our B. So either two X minus one\\nneeds to be equal to zero, or X plus four needs to be equal to zero, or both of them needs to be equal to zero. So I could write that as two X minus one needs to be equal to zero, or X plus four, or X, let me do that orange. Actually, let me do the two X minus one in that yellow color. So either two X minus\\none is equal to zero, or X plus four is equal to zero. X plus four is equal to zero, and so let\\'s solve each of these. If two X minus one could be equal to zero, well, let\\'s see, you could\\nadd one to both sides, and we get two X is equal to one. Divide both sides by two, and this just straightforward solving a linear equation. If this looks unfamiliar, I encourage you to watch videos on solving linear\\nequations on Khan Academy, but you\\'ll get X is equal\\nto 1/2 as one solution. This is interesting \\'cause we\\'re gonna have\\ntwo solutions here, or over here, if we wanna solve for X, we can subtract four from both sides, and we would get X is\\nequal to negative four. So it\\'s neat. In an equation like this, you can actually have two solutions. X could be equal to 1/2, or X could be equal to negative four. I think it\\'s pretty interesting to substitute either one of these in. If X is equal to 1/2, what is going to happen? Well, this is going to be\\ntwo times 1/2 minus one, two times 1/2 minus one. That\\'s going to be our first expression, and then our second expression\\nis going to be 1/2 plus four. And so what\\'s this going to be equal to? Well, two times 1/2 is one. One minus one is zero, so I don\\'t care what you have over here. Zero times anything is\\ngoing to be equal to zero. So when X equals 1/2, the first thing becomes zero, making everything, making\\nthe product equal zero. And likewise, if X equals negative four, it\\'s pretty clear that\\nthis second expression is going to be zero, and even though this first expression isn\\'t going to be zero in that case, anything times zero is going to be zero. Let\\'s do one more example here. So let me delete out everything\\nthat I just wrote here, and so I\\'m gonna involve a function. So let\\'s say someone told you that F of X is equal to X minus five, times five X, plus two, and someone said, \"Find\\nthe zeros of F of X.\" Well, the zeros are, what are the X values that make F of X equal to zero? When does F of X equal zero? For what X values does F of X equal zero? That\\'s what people are really asking when they say, \"Find the zeros of F of X.\" So to do that, well, when\\ndoes F of X equal zero? Well, F of X is equal to zero when this expression right over here is equal to zero, and so it sets up just like\\nthe equation we just saw. X minus five times five X plus two, when does that equal zero? And like we saw before, well, this is just like\\nwhat we saw before, and I encourage you to pause the video, and try to work it out on your own. So there\\'s two situations where this could happen, where either the first\\nexpression equals zero, or the second expression, or maybe in some cases, you\\'ll have a situation where\\nboth expressions equal zero. So we could say either X\\nminus five is equal to zero, or five X plus two is equal to zero. I\\'ll write an, or, right over here. Now if we solve for X, you add five to both\\nsides of this equation. You get X is equal to five. Here, let\\'s see. To solve for X, you could subtract two from both sides. You get five X is equal to negative two, and you could divide both sides by five to solve for X, and you get X is equal to negative 2/5. So here are two zeros. You input either one of these into F of X. If you input X equals five, if you take F of five, if you try to evaluate F of five, then this first\\nexpression\\'s gonna be zero, and so a product of\\nzero and something else, it doesn\\'t matter that\\nthis is gonna be 27. Zero times 27 is zero, and if you take F of negative 2/5, it doesn\\'t matter what\\nthis first expression is. The second expression right over here is gonna be zero. Zero times anything is zero.

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're asked\\nto graph the equation y is equal to one-half times x minus six times x plus two. So like always, pause this video and take out some graph paper or even try to do it on\\na regular piece of paper and see if you can graph this equation. All right now, let's work\\nthrough this together. There's many different ways that you could attempt to graph it. May be the most basic is\\ntry out a bunch of x values and a bunch of y values and\\ntry to connect the curve that connects all of those dots. But let's try to see if\\nwe can get the essence of this graph without\\ndoing that much work. The key realization here without\\neven having to do the math is if I multiply this out, if I multiplied x minus\\nsix times x plus two, I'm going to get a quadratic. I'm going to get x-squared, plus something, plus something else. And so this whole thing\\nis going to be a parabola. We are graphing a quadratic equation. Now a parabola you might remember can intersect the x-axis multiple times. So let's see if we can find out where this intersects the x-axis. And the form that it's in, it's in factored form already, it makes it pretty straightforward for us to recognize\\nwhen does y equal zero? Which are going to be the\\ntimes that we're intersecting the x-axis. And then from that, we'll\\nactually be able to find the coordinates of the vertex and we're going to be able\\nto get the general shape of this curve which is\\ngoing to be a parabola. So let's think about it. When does y equal zero? Well to solve that we just\\nhave to figure out when, if we want to know when y equals zero, then we have to solve for when does this expression equal zero? So let's just solve the equation. One half times x minus six, times x plus two is equal to zero. Now in previous videos we've\\ntalked about this idea. If I have the product of multiple things and it needs to be equal to zero, the only way that's going to happen is if one or more of these things are going to be equal to zero. Well one half is one-half, it's not going to be equal to zero. But x minus six could be equal to zero. So if x minus six is equal to zero, then that would make this equation true. Or if x plus two is equal to zero, that would also make this equation true. So the x values that\\nsatisfy either of these would make y equal zero\\nand those would be places where our curve is\\nintersecting the x-axis. So what x value makes\\nx minus six equal zero? Well you could add six to both sides, you're probably able to\\ndo that in your head, and you get x is equal to six. Or you subtract two from both sides here and you get x is equal to, these cancel out, you get x is equal to negative two. These are the two x values where y will be equal to zero. You can substitute it back\\ninto our original equation. If x is equal to six, then this right over here is\\ngoing to be equal to zero, and then y is going to be equal to zero. If x is equal to negative two, then this right over here is\\ngoing to be equal to zero, and y would be equal to zero. So we know that our parabola\\nis going to intersect the x-axis at x equals\\nnegative two right over there, and x is equal to six. These are our x-intercepts. So given this, how do we\\nfigure out the vertex? Well the key idea here is to recognize that your axis of\\nsymmetry for your parabola is going to sit right between\\nyour two x-intercepts. So what is the midpoint between, or what is the average\\nof six and negative two? Well, you could do that in your head. Six plus negative two is\\nfour divided by two is two. Let me do that. So I'm just trying to find the\\nmidpoint between the point, let's use a new color. So I'm trying to find the midpoint between the point negative two comma zero and six comma zero. Well the midpoint, those are just the average of the coordinates. The average of zero and zero\\nis just going to be zero, it's going to sit on the x-axis. But then the midpoint\\nof negative two and six or the average negative\\ntwo plus six over two. Well let's see, that's four over two, that's just going to be two, so two comma zero. And you see that there. You could have done that\\nwithout even doing the math. You say okay, if I want to go right in between the two, I want to be two away from each of them. And so just like that,\\nI could draw an axis of symmetry for my parabola. So my vertex is going to sit\\non that axis of symmetry. And so how do I know what the y value is? Well I can figure out, I can substitute back\\nin my original equation, and say well what is y equal\\nwhen x is equal to two? Because remember the vertex\\nhas a coordinate x equals two. It's going to be two comma something. So let's go back, let's see what y equals. So y will equal to one-half times, we're going to see when x equals two, so two minus six, times two plus two. Let's see, this is negative four, this is positive four. Negative four times four is negative 16. So it's equal to one-half\\ntimes negative 16, which is equal to negative eight. So our vertex when x is equal to two, y is equal to negative eight. And so our vertex is going\\nto be right over here two common negative eight. And now we can draw the general shape of our actual parabola. It's going to look something like, once again this is a hand-drawn sketch, so take it with a little\\nbit of a grain of salt, but it's going to look\\nsomething like this. And it's going to be symmetric\\naround our axis of symmetry. That's why it's called\\nthe axis of symmetry. This art program I have,\\nthere's a symmetry tool, but I'll just use this and there you go. That's a pretty good sketch\\nof what this parabola is or what this graph is going\\nto look like which it is, an upward-opening parabola. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Instructor] We are\\ntold a rocket is launched from a platform. Its height in meters, x seconds\\nafter the launch is modeled by h of x is equal to\\nnegative four times x plus two times x minus 18. Now, the first thing they\\nask us is what is the height of the rocket at the time of launch? Pause the video and see if\\nyou can figure that out. Well, what is x at the time of launch? Well, x is the number of\\nseconds after the launch, so at the time of launch, x\\nwould be equal to zero. The height of the rocket when\\nx is equal to zero, they\\'re essentially saying,\\n\"Well, what is h of zero?\" To figure out h of zero, we\\njust have to go back to this expression and replace\\nall the xs with zeros. H of zero is going to be equal\\nto negative four, negative four times zero plus two,\\nwhich is just going to be two times zero minus 18,\\nwhich is just going to be negative 18. Let\\'s see, this is going\\nto be negative eight times negative 18, negative\\neight times negative 18, which is the same thing as negative eight times negative nine times two. This is going to be positive 72 times two, which is 144, so 144 meters. Did I do that right? Let\\'s see. We\\'re going to have ... Yep that sounds right. That\\'s right. How many seconds after\\nlaunch will the rocket hit the ground? Pause this video again and\\nsee if you can answer that. Well, what does it mean for\\nthe rocket to hit the ground? That means that the height is\\nequal to zero, so if you want to figure out how many\\nseconds after launch, how many seconds that\\'s x, so we want\\nto figure out the x when our height is equal to zero. We can set up an equation. Let\\'s make our height h of\\nx equal to zero, so zero is equal to negative four times x plus two times x minus 18. Well, if you have the product\\nof three different things being equal to zero, the way\\nyou get this to be equal to zero is if at least one of these three\\nthings is equal to zero. Well, negative four can\\'t be\\nequal to zero, so we could say x plus two equals zero. I got that from right over here. If x plus two were equaling\\nto zero, then this equation would be satisfied. That would be the situation\\nwhen x is equal to negative two, but remember x is the\\nnumber of seconds after the launch, so a negative\\nx would mean be going before the launch. We can rule that one out. Then, we could also think\\nabout, \"Well, x minus 18 if \"that\\'s equal to zero,\\nthen this entire expression \"could be equal to zero.\" X minus 18 equals zero,\\nyou add 18 to both sides. You get x is equal to 18, so 18 seconds after launch, well we\\'re going forward in time. 18 seconds after launch, we see that our height is zero, we have hit the ground. Next question, how many seconds\\nafter being launched will the rocket reach its maximum height? Pause the video again and see\\nif you can figure that out. Well, the key realization here is if you have a curve, if you have a parabola in\\nparticular and it\\'s going to look something like this, if you\\'re\\ngonna have a parabola that looks something like this,\\nyou\\'re going to hit your maximum height right over here\\nbetween your two zeros or between the two times\\nthat your height is zero. If you figure out this x\\nvalue and this x value, the average of the two will give\\nyou your x value the time after launch, when you\\'re\\nat your maximum height. Well, we already figured out\\nwhat this x-value is and what this x-value is. We know that h of x is equal\\nto zero when x is either equal to 18, so that is x is equal to 18 or x is equal to negative two, so that is x is equal to negative two. To answer this question, we\\njust have to go halfway between negative two and 18, so let\\'s do that. Negative two plus 18 divided by two gets us what? That\\'s going to be 16 over\\ntwo, which is going to be equal to eight. This is right over here. This is x equals eight\\nseconds the rocket is at its maximum height. Last question, what is the\\nmaximum height that the rocket will reach? Once again, pause the video\\nand try to answer that. Well, we already know from\\nthe previous question that we reach our maximum height\\nwhen x is equal to eight, eight seconds after launch. To figure out the height\\nthen, we just have to evaluate what h of eight is, h of eight. Remember that\\'s what this\\nfunction does, you give me any x value, any elapsed time after\\nlaunch and it will give me the height, so eight seconds\\nafter launch, I know I have maximum height. To figure out that height,\\nI just input it into the function, so h of eight is\\ngoing to be equal to negative four times eight plus two times eight minus 18. Eight plus two is 10. Eight minus 18 is negative 10. You have negative four times negative 100, so that\\'s\\ngoing to be positive 400. H is given in meters, so\\nthat\\'s its maximum height, 400 meters. '),\n",

       "  \"We're asked to\\nsolve the equation 2x squared plus\\n3 is equal to 75. So in this situation,\\nit looks like we might be able to isolate\\nthe x squared pretty simply. Because there's only one\\nterm that involves an x here. It's only this x squared term. So let's try to do that. So let me just rewrite it. We have 2x squared\\nplus 3 is equal to 75. And we're going to try to\\nisolate this x squared over here. And the best way to do that,\\nor at least the first step, would be to subtract 3 from\\nboth sides of this equation. So let's subtract\\n3 from both sides. The left hand side, we're\\njust left with 2x squared. That was the whole point of\\nsubtracting 3 from both sides. And on the right hand\\nside, 75 minus 3 is 72. Now, I want to isolate\\nthis x squared. I have a 2x squared here. So I could have just\\nan x squared here if I divide this side or\\nreally both sides by 2. Anything I do to one side, I\\nhave to do to the other side if I want to maintain\\nthe equality. So the left side, just\\nbecomes x squared. And the right hand side\\nis 72 divided by 2 is 36. So we're left with x\\nsquared is equal to 36. And then to solve for x,\\nwe can take the positive, the plus or minus square\\nroot of both sides. So we could say the plus or--\\nlet me write it this way-- If we take the square\\nroot of both sides, we would get x is equal to\\nthe plus or minus square root of 36, which is equal\\nto plus or minus 6. Let me just write\\nthat on another line. So x is equal to\\nplus or minus 6. And remember here, if something\\nsquared is equal to 36, that something could\\nbe the negative version or the positive version. It could be the\\nprincipal root or it could be the negative root. Both negative 6 squared is\\n36 and positive 6 squared is 36, so both of these work. And you could put them back\\ninto the original equation to verify it. Let's do that. If you say 2 times\\n6 squared plus 3, that's 2 times 36, which\\nis 72 plus 3 is 75. So that works. If you put negative\\n6 in there, you're going to get the\\nexact same result. Because negative 6\\nsquared is also 36. 2 times 36 is 72 plus 3 is 75. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Voiceover] So pause\\nthe video and see if you can solve for x here. Figure out which x-values\\nwill satisfy this equation. All right, let\\'s work through this. So, the way I\\'m gonna do\\nthis is I\\'m gonna isolate the x plus three squared on one side and the best way to do that\\nis to add four to both sides. So, adding four to both sides will get rid of this\\nfour, subtracting four, this negative four on the left-hand side. And so we\\'re just left\\nwith x plus three squared. X plus three squared. And on the right-hand\\nside I\\'m just gonna have zero plus four. So, x plus three squared is equal to four. And so now, I could take the square root of both sides and, or, another\\nway of thinking about it, if I have something-squared equaling four, I could say that that something needs to either be positive or negative two. So, one way of thinking about it is, I\\'m saying that x plus\\nthree is going to be equal to the plus or minus\\nsquare root of that four. And hopefully this makes\\nintuitive sense for you. If something-squared is equal to four, that means that the something, that means that this\\nsomething right over here, is going to be equal to the\\npositive square root of four or the negative square root of four. Or it\\'s gonna be equal to\\npositive or negative two. And so we could write that x plus three could\\nbe equal to positive two or x plus three could be\\nequal to negative two. Notice, if x plus three was positive two, two-squared is equal to four. If x plus three was negative two, negative two-squared is equal to four. So, either of these would\\nsatisfy our equation. So, if x plus three is\\nequal to two, we could just subtract three from both\\nsides to solve for x and we\\'re left with x is\\nequal to negative one. Or, over here we could subtract three from both sides to solve for x. So, or, x is equal to\\nnegative two minus three is negative five. So, those are the two possible solutions and you can verify that. Take these x-values,\\nsubstitute it back in, and then you can see when\\nyou substitute it back in if you substitute x equals negative one, then x plus three is equal to two, two-squared is four, minus four is zero. And when x is equal to negative five, negative five plus three is negative two, squared is positive four, minus\\nfour is also equal to zero. So, these are the two possible x-values that satisfy the equation. Now let\\'s do another one\\nthat\\'s presented to us in a slightly different way. So, we are told that f of x is\\nequal to x minus two squared minus nine. And then we\\'re asked at what x-values does the graph of y equals\\nf of x intersect the x-axis. So, if I\\'m just generally\\ntalking about some graph, so I\\'m not necessarily gonna\\ndraw that y equals f of x. So if I\\'m just, so that\\'s our\\ny-axis, this is our x-axis. And so if I just have the\\ngraph of some function. If I have the graph of some function that looks something like that. Let\\'s say that the y is\\nequal to some other function, not necessarily this f of x. Y is equal to g of x. The x-values where you intersect, where you intersect the x-axis. Well, in order to intersect the x-axis, y must be equal to zero. So, y is equal to zero there. Notice our y-coordinate\\nat either of those points are going to be equal to zero. And that means that our\\nfunction is equal to zero. So, figuring out the\\nx-values where the graph of y equals f of x intersects the x-axis, this is equivalent to saying, \"For what x-values does\\nf of x equal zero?\" So we could just say, \"For what x-values does\\nthis thing right over here \"equal zero?\" So, let me just write that down. So we could rewrite this as x, x minus two squared minus nine equals zero. We could add nine to both\\nsides and so we could get x minus two squared is equal to nine. And just like we saw before, that means that x minus two is equal to the positive or negative square root of nine. So, we could say x minus two\\nis equal to positive three or x minus two is equal to negative three. Well, you add two to both sides of this, you get x is equal to five, or x is equal to, if we\\nadd two to both sides of this equation, you\\'ll get\\nx is equal to negative one. And you can verify that. If x is equal to five,\\nfive minus two is three, squared is nine, minus nine is zero. So, the point five comma zero is going to be on this graph. And also, if x is equal to negative one, negative one minus two, negative three. Squared is positive\\nnine, minus nine is zero. So, also the point negative one comma zero is on this graph. So those are the points where, those are the x-values where the function intersects the x-axis. '),\n",

So this first step\\nright here-- and I encourage you to\\npause this video and try to figure\\nthis out on your own before I work through it. So this first step, let's see. She got rid of this 2 by\\ndividing the left-hand side by 2, and she\\nappropriately divided. Well, you can't just\\ndo that to one side. You have to do\\nthat to both sides in order to hold this equality. So she divided 242 by 2 as\\nwell, so that is correct. Step one makes sense. And then she just\\nwanted-- instead of this being an\\nx plus 4 squared, she wanted it to be an x plus 4. So she attempted to take the\\nsquare root of both sides. She said hey, look. The square root of x plus\\n4 squared is x plus 4, and the square\\nroot of 121 is 11. And this is where she made\\na small but very, very, very, very important mistake.

So I'm assuming\\nyou've given it a go. So let's try to work\\nthrough it together. And first, let me just\\nrewrite the equation. So we have 3 times the\\nquantity x plus 6 squared is equal to 75. So what I want to do is I want\\nto isolate the x plus 6 squared on the left-hand side. Or another way of\\nthinking about it-- I don't want this\\n3 here anymore. So how would I\\nget rid of that 3? Well, I could divide\\nthe left-hand side by 3. But if I do that to only\\none side of the equation, it won't be equal anymore. These two things in yellow\\nwere equal to each other. If I want the equalities\\nto hold, anything that I do to the\\nleft-hand side, I have to do the right-hand side. So let me divide\\nthat by 3 as well. And so on the\\nleft-hand side, I am left with x plus 6 squared\\nis equal to 75 divided by 3. So 75 divided by 3 is 25. So actually, let me just\\npick out the first one I did. I divided both sides by 3. So that was my first step then. Let me write that\\nin a darker color. So that was my first\\nstep right over there. Now let's think about\\nwhat we're doing. We're saying that something\\nsquared is equal to 25. So this something could be\\nthe positive or negative square root of 25. So we could write\\nthis as x plus 6 is equal to the plus or\\nminus square root of 25. So I'm essentially taking\\nthe positive and negative square root of both sides. So, let's see. This looks like this step. I took the square\\nroot of both sides. That's step number two. And so, let me\\njust rewrite this. This is the same thing as x plus\\n6 is equal to plus or minus 5. And now I want to just have\\nan x on the left-hand side. I want to solve for x. That's the goal\\nfrom the beginning. So I would like to\\nget rid of this 6. Well, the easiest\\nway to do that is to subtract 6 from\\nthe left-hand side. But just like\\nbefore, I can't just do it from one side\\nof an equation. Then the equality\\nwouldn't be true. We're literally\\nsaying that x plus 6 is equal to plus or minus 5. So x plus 6 minus\\n6 is going to be equal to plus or\\nminus 5 minus 6. Or actually, let me\\nwrite it this way. So let me subtract\\n6 from both sides. On the left-hand side,\\nI'm left with an x. And on the right-hand side,\\nI could write it this way. Let me do it in\\nthat green color. I have negative 6\\nplus or minus 5. So what are the\\npossible values of x? Or actually, I keep forgetting. We don't have to actually\\ngive the value for x. We just have to say\\nwhat steps we did. So then, let's see. After we took the square\\nroot of both sides, we then subtracted\\n6 from both sides. So that was step three\\nright over there. Then that got us to essentially\\nthe two possible x's that would satisfy this\\nequation right over here. And just for fun, let's\\nactually solve it all the way. So if we solve it all the way,\\nso x is equal to negative 6 plus 5 is negative 1, or x is\\nequal to negative 6 minus 5 is negative 11. And you could verify\\nthat both of these work. If you put either of them in\\nhere-- if you put negative 1 here, you get negative 1\\nplus 6 squared is 5 squared. If you put negative 11 here,\\nit's negative 11 plus 6 is negative 5 squared. Obviously either plus or minus\\n5 squared is going to be 25. 25 times 3 is 75. So these are our three steps. We divided both sides by 3. Then we took the square\\nroot of both sides. Then we subtracted\\n6 from both sides. And then we were\\nessentially done. So let's input those steps. So the first thing we did,\\nwe divide both sides by 3. That's the first thing we did.

       "  '- [Instructor] It might not be obvious when you look at these three equations but they\\'re the exact same equation. They\\'ve just been\\nalgebraically manipulated. They are in different forms. This is the equation and sometimes called standard\\nform for a quadratic. This is the quadratic in factored form. Notice this has been\\nfactored right over here. And this last form is what we\\'re going to\\nfocus on in this video. This is sometimes known as vertex form and we\\'re not gonna focus on how do you get from\\none of these other forms to a vertex form in this video, we\\'ll do that in future videos,\\nbut what we\\'re going to do is appreciate why this\\nis called vertex form. Now to start, let\\'s just remind\\nourselves what a vertex is. As you might remember from other videos, if we have a quadratic,\\nif we\\'re graphing y is equal to some quadratic\\nexpression in terms of x, the graph of that will be a parabola, and it might be an upward opening parabola or a downward opening parabola. This one in particular is going to be an upward opening parabola, and so it might look something like this. It might look something like this right over here. And for an upward opening\\nparabola like this, the vertex is this point right over here. You could view it as this minimum point. You have your x-coordinate of\\nthe vertex right over there and you have your y-coordinate of the vertex right over here. Now the reason why this\\nis called vertex form is it\\'s fairly straightforward\\nto pick out the coordinates of this vertex from this form. How do we do that? Well, to do that, we just have\\nto appreciate the structure that\\'s in this expression. Let me just rewrite it again. We have y is equal to three\\ntimes x plus two squared minus 27. The important thing to realize is that this part of the expression is never going to be negative. No matter what you have\\nhere, if you square it, you\\'re never going to\\nget a negative value. And so this is never going to be negative and we\\'re multiplying it by\\na positive right over here. This whole thing right over here is going to be greater\\nthan or equal to zero. So another way to think about it, it\\'s only going to be\\nadditive to negative 27. So your minimum point for\\nthis curve right over here, for your parabola, is going to happen when this expression is equal to zero, when you\\'re not adding\\nanything to negative 27. And so, when will this equal zero? Well, it\\'s going to be equal to zero when x plus two is going\\nto be equal to zero. So you could just say, if you wanna find the\\nx-coordinate of the vertex, well, for what x value\\ndoes x plus two equal zero? And of course we can\\nsubtract two from both sides and you get x is equal to\\nnegative two, so we know that this x-coordinate right\\nover here is negative two. And then what\\'s the\\ny-coordinate of the vertex? You could just say, \"Hey,\\nwhat is the minimum y \"that this curve takes on?\" Well, when x is equal to negative two, this whole thing is zero and\\ny is equal to negative 27. Y is equal to negative 27, so this right over here is negative 27. And so the coordinates of the vertex here are negative two comma negative 27. And you are able to pick that out just by looking at the\\nquadratic in vertex form. Now let\\'s get a few more\\nexamples under our belt so that we can really get\\ngood at picking out the vertex when a quadratic is\\nwritten in vertex form. So let\\'s say let\\'s pick a scenario where we have a downward opening parabola, where y is equal to, let\\'s\\njust say negative two times x plus five, actually, let me make it x minus five. X minus five squared, and then let\\'s say plus 10. Well here, this is gonna\\nbe downward opening and let\\'s appreciate why that is. So here, this part is still\\nalways going to be non-negative but it\\'s being multiplied\\nby a negative two, so it\\'s actually always\\ngonna be non-positive. So this whole thing right over here is going to be less than or\\nequal to zero for all x\\'s, so it could only take away from the 10. So, where do we hit a maximum point? Well, we hit a maximum point when x minus five is equal to zero, when we\\'re not taking\\nanything away from the 10. And so, x minus five is equal to zero. Well, that of course is going to happen when x is equal to five, and that indeed is the\\nx-coordinate for the vertex. And what\\'s the y-coordinate\\nfor the vertex? Well, if x is equal to five\\nand this thing is zero, you\\'re not gonna be taking\\nanything away from the 10 and so y is going to be equal to 10. And so the vertex here is x equals five, and I\\'m just gonna eyeball it, maybe it\\'s right over here, x equals five. And y is equal to 10. If this is negative 27,\\nthis would be positive 27, 10 would be something like this. I\\'m not using the same\\nscales for the x and y-axis, but there you have it. So it\\'s five comma 10 and our curve is gonna\\nlook something like this. I don\\'t know exactly where\\nit intersects the x-axis but it\\'s going to be a\\ndownward opening parabola. Let\\'s do one more example just so that we get really fluent at identifying the\\nvertex from vertex form. So let\\'s say, I\\'m just gonna make this up, we have y is equal to negative pi times x minus 2.8 squared plus 7.1. What is the vertex of the parabola here? Well, the x-coordinate is\\ngoing to be the x value that makes this equal\\nto zero, which is 2.8. And then if this is equal to zero, then this whole thing is\\ngoing to be equal to zero and y is going to be 7.1. So now, you hopefully appreciate why this is called vertex form. It\\'s quite straightforward\\nto pick out the vertex when you have something\\nwritten in this way. '),\n",

So y is equal to negative 2\\ntimes x minus 2 squared plus 5. So one thing, when you see a\\nquadratic or a parabola graph expressed in this way, the\\nthing that might jump out at you is that this term\\nright over here is always going to be\\npositive because it's some quantity squared. Or I should say, it's always\\ngoing to be non-negative. It could be equal to 0. So it's always going to\\nbe some quantity squared. And then we're multiplying\\nit by a negative. So this whole quantity\\nright over here is going to be non positive. It's always going to be\\nless than or equal to 0. So this thing is always\\nless than or equal to 0, the maximum value\\nthat y will take on is when this thing\\nactually does equal 0. So the maximum\\nvalue for y is at 5. The maximum value for y is 5. And when does that happen? Well, y hits 5 when\\nthis whole thing is 0. And when does this\\nthing equal 0? Well, this whole thing equals\\n0 when x minus 2 is equal to 0. And x minus 2 is equal to\\n0 when x is equal to 2. So the point 2 comma\\n5 is the maximum point for this parabola. And it is actually\\ngoing to be the vertex. So if we were to graph this,\\nso the point 2 comma 5. So that's my y-axis. This is my x-axis. So this is 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So this right here is\\nthe point 2 comma 5. This is a maximum point,\\nit's a maximum point for this parabola. And now I want to find two more\\npoints so that I can really determine the parabola. Three points completely\\ndetermine a parabola. So that's 1, the vertex,\\nthat's interesting. Now, what I'd like\\nto do is just get two points that are\\nequidistant from the vertex. And the easiest way to do\\nthat is to maybe figure out what happens when x is equal\\nto 1 and when x is equal to 3. So I could make a table here\\nactually, let me do that. So I care about x being equal\\nto 1, 2, and 3, and what the corresponding y is. We already know that when x is\\nequal to 2, y is equal to 5. 2 comma 5 is our vertex. When x is equal to 1, 1\\nminus 2 is negative 1, squared is just 1. So this thing is going\\nto be negative 2 plus 5, so it's going to be 3. And when x is equal to\\n3, this is 3 minus 2, which is 1 squared is 1 times\\nnegative 2 is negative 2 plus 5 is 3 as well. So we have three points. We have the point 1 comma\\n3, the point 2 comma 5, and the point 3 comma\\n3 for this parabola. So let me go back\\nto the exercise and actually put\\nthose three points in. And so we have the point 1 comma\\n3, we have the point 2 comma 5, and we have the point 3 comma 3. And we have now fully\\ndetermined our parabola. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Sal] An object is\\nlaunched from a platform. Its height in meters, x\\nseconds after the launch, is modeled by: h of x is\\nequal to negative five times x minus four squared plus 180. Normally, when they talk\\nabout seconds or time, they usually would use the variable t, but we can roll with x being that. Let\\'s think about what\\'s\\ngoing to happen here. Lemme just visualize it. Lemme draw an h axis for our height. Let me draw an x axis. An x axis. At time x is equal to zero. We\\'re on a platform, so we\\'re already gonna have some height. At time x is equal to zero. I\\'m used to saying time t equals zero, but at time x is equal to zero, we\\'re already gonna have some height \\'cause we\\'re on some platform. And then we\\'re gonna\\nlaunch this projectile. And, it\\'s gonna go in\\nthe shape of a parabola, and it\\'s gonna be a\\ndownward-opening parabola. You might say: \"Sal, how do you know \"it\\'s gonna be a\\ndownward-opening parabola?\" Gonna look something like that. I didn\\'t draw it exactly perfectly, but you get, hopefully, the point. The reason why I knew it was a parabola, in particular a downward-opening parabola, is when you look at what\\'s going on here. This is written in vertex\\nform but it\\'s a quadratic. In vertex form, you have an\\nexpression with x squared, and then you\\'re multiplying by negative five right over here. This tells us that it\\'s\\ngonna be downward-opening. If you were to multiply this out, x minus four squared is gonna be x squared plus something else plus something else, then you\\'re gonna have to multiply all those terms by negative five, your leading term is gonna\\nbe negative five x squared. Once again, it\\'s gonna be\\na downward-opening parabola that looks something like that. So, given this visual\\nintuition that we have, let\\'s see if we can answer\\nsome questions about it. The first one I\\'d like to answer is how high is the platform. How high is the platform? How high is the platform? I encourage you to pause the video, and try to figure that out. What is that value right over there? Well, as you can see, we are at that value\\nat time x equals zero. So to figure out how high is the platform, we essentially just have\\nto evaluate h of zero. That\\'s going to be negative five times negative four squared plus 180. I just substituted x with zero. Negative four squared is 16. Negative five times 16 is negative 80. Plus 180. So this is going to be equal to 100. So the platform is 100 meters tall. Remember, the height is given in meters. Now, the next question I have is, how many seconds after launch\\ndo we hit our maximum height? So our maximum height,\\nif we\\'re talking about a downward-opening parabola,\\nit\\'s going to be our vertex, is going to be our maximum height. And so, the x value of that would tell us how long after takeoff,\\nhow long after, or launch, do we hit the maximum height. Trying to use a color you can see. What is this x value right over here? Once again, pause the video, and see if you can figure it out. We\\'re trying to answer how long after launch is the maximum height. Well, it\\'s going to be the\\nx coordinate of our vertex. How do we figure that out? Well, this quadratic has\\nactually been written already in vertex form, which\\nmakes it sound like it should be relatively easy to figure\\nout the vertex over here. To appreciate that, we\\nhave to see the structure in the expression, is one\\nway to think about it. Let\\'s think about what\\'s going on. You have this 180. And then you this other\\nterm right over here. Anything squared is gonna be nonnegative. So x minus four squared is\\nalways gonna be nonnegative. But then you always multiply\\nthat times a negative five, so this whole thing is\\ngonna be non-positive. So, it will never add to the 180. Your maximum value is when\\nthis term right over here is going to be equal to zero. And when is this term\\ngoing to be equal to zero? In order to make this term equal to zero, then x minus four needs\\nto be equal to zero. The only way to get x minus\\nfour to be equal to zero is if x is equal to four. Just by looking at this, you say: \"Hey, what makes this zero?\" Four. X equals four will make this zero. This is right over there. If I were to write h of\\nfour, this is going to be, this term is gonna go to zero, and you\\'re gonna be left with the 180. There you go, this right over here. The maximum height is 180. It happens four seconds after launch. Now, the last question I\\'ll ask you is, how long after launch do\\nwe get to a height of zero? So, for what x makes our height zero? To do that, we have to solve\\nh of x is equal to zero. Or, we can write h of x as negative five times x minus four squared\\nplus 180 is equal to zero. And, once again, pause the video, and see if you can solve this. Could subtract 180 from both sides. You get negative five\\ntimes x minus four squared, is equal to negative 180. We can divide both sides by negative five. We get x minus four\\nsquared is equal to 36. Scroll down a little bit. Then, we could take the plus\\nand minus square root, I guess you could say. And so, that will give us x minus four could be equal to six. Or, x minus four is equal to negative six. In this first situation,\\nadd four to both sides, you get x is equal to 10. Or, you add four to both sides here, you get x is equal to negative two. Now, we\\'re dealing with time here, so negative two would\\'ve been in the past if it wasn\\'t sitting on the platform and if it was just\\ncontinuing its trajectory, I guess you could say, backwards in time. But that\\'s not the x that we\\nwanna take into consideration. We want the positive time value,\\nand that\\'s right over here. That is when x is equal to 10. 10 seconds after takeoff, our height is going to be equal to zero. If the ground is at height of zero, if it\\'s at sea level, I guess, then, that\\'s when our projectile\\nis going to hit the ground. '),\n",

       "  \"We're asked to solve for s. And we have s squared minus\\n2s minus 35 is equal to 0. Now if this is the first time\\nthat you've seen this type of what's essentially a quadratic\\nequation, you might be tempted to try to solve for s using\\ntraditional algebraic means, but the best way to solve this,\\nespecially when it's explicitly equal to 0, is to\\nfactor the left-hand side, and then think about the fact that\\nthose binomials that you factor into, that they have\\nto be equal to 0. So let's just do that. So how can we factor this? We've seen it in several ways. I'll show you the standard\\nwe've been doing it, by grouping, and then there's a\\nlittle bit of a shortcut when you have a 1 as a coefficient\\nover here. So when you do something by\\ngrouping, when you factor by grouping, you think about two\\nnumbers whose sum is going to be equal to negative 2. So you think about two numbers\\nwhose sum, a plus b, is equal to negative 2 and whose product\\nis going to be equal to negative 35. a times b is equal\\nto negative 35. So if the product is a negative\\nnumber, one has to be positive, one has\\nto be negative. And so if you think about it,\\nones that are about two apart, you have 5 and negative 7,\\nI think that'll work. 5 plus negative 7 is equal\\nto negative 2. So to factor by grouping, you\\nsplit this middle term. We can split this into a--\\nlet me write it this way. We have s squared, and then this\\nmiddle term right here, I'll do it in pink. This middle term right there I\\ncan write it as plus 5s minus 7s and then we have\\nthe minus 35. And then, of course, all\\nof that is equal to 0. Now, we call it factoring by\\ngrouping because we group it. So we can group these first two\\nterms. And these first two terms, they have a common\\nfactor of s. So let's factor that out. You have s times s plus 5. That's the same thing as\\ns squared plus 5s. Now, in these second two terms\\nright here, you have a common factor of negative 7, so\\nlet's factor that out. So you have negative\\n7 times s plus 5. And, of course, all of\\nthat is equal to 0. Now, we have two terms here,\\nwhere both of them have s plus 5 as a factor. So we can factor that out. So let's do that. So you have s plus 5 times\\nthis s right here, right? S plus 5 times s will\\ngive you this term. And then you have minus\\nthat 7 right there. I undistributed the s plus 5. And then this is going\\nto be equal to 0. Now that we've factored it, we\\njust have to think a little bit about what happens\\nwhen you take the product of two numbers? I mean, s plus 5 is a number. s minus 7 is another number. And we're saying that the\\nproduct of those two numbers is equal to zero. If ever told you that I had\\ntwo numbers, if I told you that I had the numbers a times\\nb and that they equal to 0, what do we know about either\\na or b or both of them? Well, at least one of them has\\nto be equal to 0, or both of them have to be equal to 0. So, the fact that this number\\ntimes that number is equal to zero tells us that either s plus\\n5 is equal to 0 or-- and maybe both of them-- s minus\\n7 is equal to 0. I'll do that in just green. And so you have these two\\nequations, and actually, we could say and/or. It could be or/and, either way,\\nand both of them could be equal to 0. So let's see how we can\\nsolve for this. Well, we can just subtract\\n5 from both sides of this equation right there. And so you get, on the left-hand\\nside, you have s is equal to negative 5. That is one solution to the\\nequation, or you can add 7 to both sides of that equation, and\\nyou get s is equal to 7. So if s is equal to negative 5,\\nor s is equal to 7, then we have satisfied this equation. We can even verify it. If you make s equal to negative\\n5, you have positive 25 plus 10, which is minus 35. That does equal zero. If you have 7, 49 minus 14\\nminus 35 does equal zero. So we've solved for s. Now, I mentioned there's\\nan easier way to do it. And when you have something like\\nthis, where you have 1 as the leading coefficient,\\nyou don't have to do this two-step factoring. Let me just show\\nyou an example. If I just have x plus a\\ntimes x plus b, what is that equal to? x times x is x squared,\\nx times b is bx. a times x is plus ax. a times b is ab. So you get x squared plus--\\nthese two can be added-- plus a plus bx plus ab. And that's the pattern that\\nwe have right here. We have 1 as a leading\\ncoefficient here, we have 1 as a leading coefficient here. So once we have our two\\nnumbers that add up to negative 2, that's our a plus\\nb, and we have our product that gets to negative 35, then\\nwe can straight just factor it into the product of\\nthose two things. So it will be-- or the product\\nof the binomials, where those will be the a's and the b's. So we figured it out. It's 5 and negative 7. 5 plus negative 7\\nis negative 2. 5 times negative 7\\nis negative 35. So we could have just straight\\nfactored at this point. 2, well, actually this\\nwas the case of s. So we could have factored it\\nstraight to the case of s plus 5 times s minus 7. We could have done that straight\\naway and would've gotten to that right there. And, of course, that whole\\nthing was equal to zero. So that would've been a little\\nbit of a shortcut, but factoring by grouping is a\\ncompletely appropriate way to do it as well. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] We have six\\nx squared, minus 120 x, plus 600, equals zero. Like always, pause this video, and see if you can solve for x, if you could find the x values\\nthat satisfy this equation. Alright, let's work through this together. The numbers here don't seem\\nlike outlandish numbers. They seem like something that\\nI might be able to deal with, and I might be able to factor,\\nso let's try to do that. The first thing I like\\nto do is see if I can get a coefficient of one, on\\nthe second degree term, on the x-squared term. It looks like actually all of these terms are divisible by six. So if we divide both sides\\nof this equation by six, I'm still going to have\\nnice integer coefficients. Let's do that. Let's divide both sides by six. If we divide the left side\\nby six, divide by six, divide by six, divide by six. And I divide the right side by six. If I do that, and clearly\\nif I do the same thing to both sides of the equation, then the equality still holds. On the left-hand side, I am\\ngoing to be left with x squared, and then negative 120, divided by six. That is, let's see. 120 divided by six is 20. So that's minus 20 x. Then 600 divided by six, is 100. So plus 100, is equal\\nto zero divided by six. Is equal to zero. So let's see if we can factor, if we can express this quadratic as a product of two expressions. The way we think about this, and we've done it multiple times, if we have something, if we have x plus a, times x plus b, and this is\\nhopefully review for you. If you multiply that out,\\nthat is going to be equal to, that equals to x squared, plus a, plus b, x, plus a b. What we want to do is\\nsee if we can factor this into an x plus a, and an x plus b. A plus b, needs to be\\nequal to negative 20. That needs to be a plus b. And then a times b, right over here, that needs to be equal\\nto the constant term. That needs to be a times\\nb, right over there. Can we think of two numbers,\\nthat if we take their product, we get positive 100, and\\nif we take their sum, we get negative 20? Well since their product is positive, we know that they have the same sign. They're both going to have the same sign. They're either both going to be positive, or their both going to be negative, since we know that we\\nhave a positive product. Since their sum is negative, well they both must both be negative. You can't add up two positive\\nnumbers, and get a negative. So they both must be negative. Let's think about it a little bit. What negative numbers,\\nwhen I add them together I get negative 20, when\\nI multiply it, I get 100? Well you could try to factor 100. You could say, well negative\\ntwo times negative 50, or negative four times negative 25. But the one that might jump out at you is this is negative 10,\\ntimes, I'll write it this way, negative 10, times negative 10, and this is negative 10, plus negative 10. So in that case, both our a and\\nour b, would be negative 10. And so we can rewrite the\\nleft side of this equation as, we can rewrite it as, x, and I'll write it this way at first, x plus negative 10, times, x plus negative 10 again. X plus negative 10, and that is going to be equal to zero. So all I've done is I've\\nfactored this quadratic. Another way, these are both\\nthe same thing as x minus 10. I could rewrite this\\nas x minus 10, squared, is equal to zero. The only way that the left-hand side is going to be equal to zero, is if x minus 10 is equal to zero. You could think of this as taking the square root of both sides. It doesn't matter if\\nyou're taking the positive or negative square root, or both of them. The square root of zero, is zero. So, we would say, that x minus\\n10 needs to be equal to zero. So x , adding 10 to both sides of this, you have x is equal to 10, is the solution to this quadratic equation, up here. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] So let's\\ntry to find the solutions to this equation right over here. We have the quantity two\\nX minus three squared, and that is equal to four X minus six, and I encourage you to pause the video and give it a shot. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint, you could do this in the traditional way of expanding this out, and then turning it into kind\\nof a classic quadratic form, but there might be a faster\\nor a simpler way to do this if you really pay\\nattention to the structure of both sides of this equation. Well let's look at this, we\\nhave two X minus three squared on the left-hand side, on the right-hand side\\nwe have four X minus six. Well four X minus six,\\nthat's just two times two X minus three, let me be clear there, so this is the same thing as two X minus three squared is equal to, four X minus six, if I factor out a two, that's two times two X minus three. And so this is really interesting, we have something squared is equal to two times that something. So if we can solve for the something, let me be very clear here, so the stuff in blue squared is equal to two times the stuff in blue. So if we can solve for what the stuff in blue could be equal to, then we could solve for X, and I'll show you that right now. So let's say, let's just\\nreplace two X minus three, we'll do a little bit of a substitution, let's replace that with P. So let's say that P is equal to two X minus three. Well then this equation\\nsimplifies quite nicely, the left-hand side becomes P squared, P squared is equal to two times P, 'cause once again two X minus three is P, two times P. And now we just have to solve for P. And I'll switch to just one color now. So we can write this as, if we subtract two P from both sides, we can get P squared minus two P is equal to zero, and we can factor out a P, so we get P times P minus two is equal to zero. And we've seen this shown multiple times, if I have the product of two\\nthings and they equal to zero, at least one of them\\nneeds to be equal to zero, so either P is equal to zero, or P minus two is equal to zero. Well if P minus two is equal to zero, then that means P is equal to two. So either P equals zero, or P equals two. Well we're not quite done yet, because we wanted to solve for X, and not for P. But luckily we know that two X minus three is equal to P. So now we could say either two X minus three is going\\nto be equal to this P value, is going to be equal to zero, or two X minus three is going\\nto be equal to this P value, is going to be equal to two. And so this is pretty\\nstraightforward to solve, add three to both sides, you get two X is equal to three. Divide both sides by two, and we get X is equal to 3/2, or over here if we add\\nthree to both sides, we get two X is equal to five. Divide both sides by two, and you get X is equal to 5/2. So these are the possible solutions, and this is pretty neat. This one right over here, you could almost do this in your head, it was nice and simple. Well if you were to expand this out, and then subtract this, it would have been a much more complex set of operations that you would have done. You still would have hopefully\\ngotten to the right answer, but it would have just\\ntaken a lot more steps. But here we could appreciate some patterns that we saw in our equations, and namely, we have\\nthis thing being squared and then we have two\\ntimes that same thing, two times two X minus three. \"),\n",

       "  \"The height of a triangle\\nis four inches less than the length of the base. The area of the triangle\\nis 30 inches squared. Find the height and base. Use the formula area\\nequals one half base times height for the\\narea of a triangle. OK. So let's think about\\nit a little bit. We have the-- let me\\ndraw a triangle here. So this is our triangle. And let's say that the\\nlength of this bottom side, that's the base,\\nlet's call that b. And then this is the height. This is the height\\nright over here. And then the area is equal to\\none half base times height. Now in this first\\nsentence they tell us at the height\\nof a triangle is four inch is less than\\nthe length of the base. So the height is equal\\nto the base minus 4. That's what that first\\nsentence tells us. The area of the triangle\\nis 30 inches squared. So if we take one half\\nthe base times the height we'll get 30 inches squared. Or we could say that\\n30 inches squared is equal to one half times\\nthe base, times the height. Now instead of putting\\nan h in for height, we know that the height\\nis the same thing as 4 less than the base. So let's put that in there. 4 less than the base. And then let's see\\nwhat we get here. We get-- let me\\ndo this in yellow. We get 30 is equal to\\none half times-- let's distribute the b-- times\\nb, let me make it clear. So let's do it this way. Times b over 2,\\ntimes b, minus 4. I just multiplied the\\none half times the b. Now let's distribute\\nthe b over 2. So 30 is equal to b\\nsquared over 2, be careful. b over 2 times b is\\njust b squared over 2. And then b over 2, times\\nnegative 4 is negative 2b. Now just to get rid\\nof this fraction here let's multiply both\\nsides of this equation by 2. So let's multiply\\nthat side by 2. And let's multiply\\nthat side by 2. On the left hand\\nside you get 60. On the right hand side\\n2 times b squared over 2 is just b squared. Negative 2b times\\n2 is negative 4b. And now we have\\na quadratic here. And the best way to\\nsolve a quadratic-- we have a second degree\\nterm right here-- is to get all of the terms\\non one side of the equation, having them equal 0. So let's subtract 60 from\\nboth sides of this equation. And we get 0 equal to b\\nsquared, minus 4b, minus 60. And so what we need\\nto do here is just factor this thing right\\nnow, or factor it. And then, no-- if I have\\nthe product of some things, and that equals 0, that\\nmeans that either one or both of those things need\\nto be equal to 0. So we need to factor b\\nsquared, minus 4b, minus 60. So what we want to do, we\\nwant to find two numbers whose sum is negative 4 and\\nwhose product is negative 60. Now, given that the\\nproduct is negative, we know there are\\ndifferent signs. And this tells us that\\ntheir absolute values are going to be four apart. That one is going to be\\nfour less than the others. So you could look at the\\nproducts of the factors of 60. 1 and 60 are too far apart. Even if you made\\none of the negative, you would either get positive\\n59 as the sum or negative 59 as the sum. 2 and 30, still too far apart. 3 and 20, still too far apart. If you had made\\none negative you'd either get negative\\n17 or positive 17. Then you could have 4 and\\n15, still too far apart. If you made one\\nof them negative, their sum would be either\\nnegative 11 or positive 11. Then you have 5 and a 12,\\nstill seems too far apart from each other. One of them is negative,\\nthen you either have their sum being\\npositive 7 or negative 7. Then you have 6 and 10. Now this looks interesting. They are four apart. So if we make-- and we want\\nthe larger absolute magnitude number to be negative so\\nthat their sum is negative. So if we make it\\n6 and negative 10 their sum will be negative\\n4, and their product is negative 60. So that works. So you could literally\\nsay that this is equal to b plus 6, times\\nb, minus 10. b plus the a, plus b minus the b. And let me be very careful here. This b over here, I want\\nto make it very clear, is different than the b that\\nwe're using in the equation. I just used this b\\nhere to say, look, we're looking for two numbers\\nthat add up to this second term right over here. It's a different b. I could have said x plus\\ny is equal to negative 4, and x times y is\\nequal to negative 60. In fact, let me do it that way\\njust so we don't get confused. So we could write x plus\\ny is equal to negative 4. And then we have x times\\ny is equal to negative 60. So we have b plus 6,\\ntimes b plus y. x is 6, y is negative 10. And that is equal to 0. Let's just solve\\nthis right here. And then we'll go\\nback and show you. You could also factor\\nthis by grouping. But just from this, we know\\nthat either one of these is equal to zero. Either b plus 6 is equal to 0,\\nor b minus 10 is equal to 0. If we subtract 6 from both\\nsides of this equation, we get b is equal to negative 6. Or if you add 10 to both\\nsides of this equation, you get b is equal to 10. And those are our two solutions. You could put them\\nback in and verify that they satisfy\\nour constraints. Now the other way that\\nyou could solve this, and we're going to\\nget exact same answer. Is you could just break\\nup this negative 4b into its constituents. So you could have broken this\\nup into 0 is equal to b squared. And then you could have broken\\nit up into plus 6b, minus 10b, minus 60. And then factor it by grouping. Group these first two terms. Group these second two terms. Just going to add them together. The first one you\\ncould factor out a b. So you have b times b, plus 6. The second one you can\\nfactor out a negative 10. So minus 10 times b, plus 6. All that's equal to 0. And now you can\\nfactor out a b plus 6. So if you factor\\nout a b plus 6 here, you get 0 is equal to b\\nminus 10, times b, plus 6. We're literally just factoring\\nout this out of the expression. You're just left\\nwith a b minus 10. You get the same thing that\\nwe did in one step over here. Whatever works for you. But either way,\\nthe solutions are either b is equal to negative\\n6, or b is equal to 10. And we have to be careful here. Remember, this is\\na word problem. We can't just state, oh b could\\nbe negative 6 or b could be 10. We have to think about\\nwhether this makes sense in the context of\\nthe actual problem. We're talking about\\nlengths of triangles, or lengths of the\\nsides of triangles. We can't have a negative length. So because of that,\\nthe base of a triangle can't have length of negative 6. So we can cross that out. So we actually only\\nhave one solution here. Almost made a careless mistake. Forgot that we were dealing\\nwith the word problem. The only possible base is 10. And let's see, they say find\\nthe height and the base. Once again, done. So the base we're saying is 10. The height is four inches less. It's b minus 4. So the height is 6. And then you can verify. The area is 6 times 10\\ntimes one half, which is 30. \"),\n",

The length is x units, the width\\nis x plus 4 units, and the height is 9 units. So let me draw this box here. Let me draw a little box here,\\nso we have a nice little visualization. So they tell us, that\\nthe length is x. Maybe we could call this\\nthe length right there. They say the width is x\\nplus 4, and the height is 9 of this box. In units, what are the\\ndimensions of the box? Well, they also tell us that\\nthe volume is 405. So the volume, 405-- let\\nme do it this way. So if we wanted to calculate the\\nvolume, what would it be? Well it would be the width-- it\\nwould be x plus 4 times the length -- times x-- times 9. That's, literally, the\\nvolume of the box. Now they also tell us that the\\nvolume of the box is 405 cubic units, is equal to 405. So now we just solve for x. So what do we get here? If we distribute this x\\ninto this x plus 4. Actually, if we distribute\\na 9x. Let me just rewrite it. This is the same thing\\nas 9x times x plus 4 is equal to 405. 9x times x is equal\\nto 9x squared. 9x times 4 is equal to\\n36x, is equal to 405. Now we want our quadratic\\nexpression to be equal to 0. So let's subtract 405 from both\\nsides of this equation. So when you do that, your\\nright-hand side equals 0, and your left-hand side is 9x\\nsquared plus 36x minus 405. Now, is there any common\\nfactor to these numbers right here? Well 405, 4 plus 0 plus 5 is 9,\\nso that is divisible by 9. So all of these are\\ndivisible by 9. Let's just figure out what\\n405 divided by 9 is. So 9 goes into 405-- 9\\ngoes into 40 4 times. 4 times 9 is 36. Subtract you get 45. 9 goes into 45 5 times. 5 times 9 is 45. Subtract, you get 0. So it goes 45 times. So if we factor out a 9 here,\\nwe get 9 times x squared-- actually even better, you\\ndon't even have to factor out of 9. If you think about it, you can\\ndivide both sides of this equation by 9. So if you can divide all of\\nthe terms by 9, it won't change the equation. You're doing the same thing to\\nboth sides of equations, which we've learned long ago is a\\nvery valid thing to do. So here you get x squared-- if\\nyou just had this expression, here, and someone told you to\\nfactor it, then you'd have to factor out the 9. But because this is an equation,\\nit equals 0, let's just divide everything by 9. It'll simplify things. So you get x squared plus 4x\\nminus 45 is equal to 0. And now we can try to factor\\nthis right here. And this fits the pattern, where\\nwe don't have a leading 1 out here. So we don't even have to\\ndo it by grouping. You just have to think, what 2\\nnumbers, when I take their product I get negative 45, and\\nwhen I take their sum, I get positive 4. They are 4 apart. 1 has to be positive, 1\\nhas to be negative. Their positive versions\\nhave to be 4 apart. Because when you take the sum,\\nyou are really taking their difference because 1 of\\nthem is negative. So let's think about it. When you have positive\\n9 and negative 5, I think that'll work. Right? Positive 9 plus negative\\n5 is 4. And when you take the product,\\nyou get negative 45. So you have x plus 9 times\\nx minus 5 is equal to 0. Just factored it out. And we've seen this before. If you have 2 numbers, when you\\ntake their product that equals 0, that means 1 of these\\nnumbers at least has to be equal 0. So this means that x plus\\n9 is equal to 0. Scroll down a little bit. x plus 9 is equal 0, or\\nx minus 5 is equal 0. So if we subtract 9 from this\\nequation right there, you get x is equal to negative 9, or if\\nyou add 5 to both sides of this equation, here. You get x is equal to 5. So these are both possible\\nvalues of x right here. So the box, if you take x is\\nequal to negative 9, well, x equal to negative\\n9 won't work. Because if you but negative 9\\nhere, you're going to have a box that has a width of negative\\n5, a length of negative 9, and a height of 9. And if we're talking about our\\nreality, we don't have negative distances like this. That can't be the length\\nor the width. So x equals negative 9 isn't\\nappropriate for this problem Because in this problem we\\nneed to have positive dimensions. So let's see what happens\\nwith x equals 5. If x equals 5, x plus 4 is 9,\\nand this dimension right here is going to be 5. And that seems pretty reasonable\\nfor our reality. And let's verify that\\nthis does end up with a volume of 405. 9 times 5 is 45 times\\n9 is indeed 405. We just figured that out over\\nhere, that 45 times 9 is 405. So we're done. \"),\n",

If you complete the square here,\\nyou're actually going to get this solution and that\\nis the quadratic formula, right there. So let's apply it to some\\nproblems. Let's start off with something that we could have\\nfactored just to verify that it's giving us the\\nsame answer. So let's say we have x\\nsquared plus 4x minus 21 is equal to 0. So in this situation-- let me\\ndo that in a different color --a is equal to 1, right? The coefficient on the\\nx squared term is 1. b is equal to 4, the coefficient\\non the x-term. And then c is equal\\nto negative 21, the constant term. And let's just plug it in the\\nformula, so what do we get? We get x, this tells us that\\nx is going to be equal to negative b. Negative b is negative 4-- I put\\nthe negative sign in front of that --negative b\\nplus or minus the square root of b squared. b squared is 16, right? 4 squared is 16, minus 4 times\\na, which is 1, times c, which is negative 21. So we can put a 21 out there\\nand that negative sign will cancel out just like that with\\nthat-- Since this is the first time we're doing it, let me\\nnot skip too many steps. So negative 21, just so you\\ncan see how it fit in, and then all of that over 2a. a is 1, so all of that over 2. So what does this simplify, or\\nhopefully it simplifies? So we get x is equal to negative\\n4 plus or minus the square root of-- Let's see we\\nhave a negative times a negative, that's going to\\ngive us a positive. And we had 16 plus, let's see\\nthis is 6, 4 times 1 is 4 times 21 is 84. 16 plus 84 is 100. That's nice. That's a nice perfect square. All of that over 2, and so this\\nis going to be equal to negative 4 plus or\\nminus 10 over 2. We could just divide both of\\nthese terms by 2 right now. So this is equal to negative 4\\ndivided by 2 is negative 2 plus or minus 10 divided\\nby 2 is 5. So that tells us that x could be\\nequal to negative 2 plus 5, which is 3, or x could be equal\\nto negative 2 minus 5, which is negative 7. So the quadratic formula\\nseems to have given us an answer for this. You can verify just by\\nsubstituting back in that these do work, or you could even\\njust try to factor this right here. You say what two numbers when\\nyou take their product, you get negative 21 and when you\\ntake their sum you get positive 4? So you'd get x plus 7\\ntimes x minus 3 is equal to negative 21. Notice 7 times negative 3 is\\nnegative 21, 7 minus 3 is positive 4. You would get x plus-- sorry\\nit's not negative --21 is equal to 0. There should be a 0 there. So you get x plus 7 is equal\\nto 0, or x minus 3 is equal to 0. X could be equal to negative\\n7 or x could be equal to 3. So it definitely gives us the\\nsame answer as factoring, so you might say, hey why bother\\nwith this crazy mess? And the reason we want to bother\\nwith this crazy mess is it'll also work for problems\\nthat are hard to factor. And let's do a couple of\\nthose, let's do some hard-to-factor problems\\nright now. So let's scroll down to get\\nsome fresh real estate. Let's rewrite the formula again,\\njust in case we haven't had it memorized yet. x is going\\nto be equal to negative b plus or minus the square root\\nof b squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. I'll supply this to\\nanother problem. Let's say we have the equation\\n3x squared plus 6x is equal to negative 10. Well, the first thing we want\\nto do is get it in the form where all of our terms or on the\\nleft-hand side, so let's add 10 to both sides\\nof this equation. We get 3x squared plus the\\n6x plus 10 is equal to 0. And now we can use a\\nquadratic formula. So let's apply it here. So a is equal to 3. That is a, this is b and\\nthis right here is c. So the quadratic formula\\ntells us the solutions to this equation. The roots of this quadratic\\nfunction, I guess we could call it. x is going to be equal\\nto negative b. b is 6, so negative 6\\nplus or minus the square root of b squared. b is 6, so we get 6 squared\\nminus 4 times a, which is 3 times c, which is 10. Let's stretch out the radical\\nlittle bit, all of that over 2 times a, 2 times 3. So we get x is equal to negative\\n6 plus or minus the square root of 36 minus-- this\\nis interesting --minus 4 times 3 times 10. So this is minus-- 4\\ntimes 3 times 10. So this is minus 120. All of that over 6. So this is interesting, you\\nmight already realize why it's interesting. What is this going\\nto simplify to? 36 minus 120 is what? That's 84. We make this into a 10,\\nthis will become an 11, this is a 4. It is 84, so this is going to be\\nequal to negative 6 plus or minus the square root of-- But\\nnot positive 84, that's if it's 120 minus 36. We have 36 minus 120. It's going to be negative\\n84 all of that 6. So you might say, gee,\\nthis is crazy. What a this silly quadratic\\nformula you're introducing me to, Sal? It's worthless. It just gives me a square root\\nof a negative number. It's not giving me an answer. And the reason why it's not\\ngiving you an answer, at least an answer that you might want,\\nis because this will have no real solutions. In the future, we're going to\\nintroduce something called an imaginary number, which is a\\nsquare root of a negative number, and then we can actually\\nexpress this in terms of those numbers. So this actually does have\\nsolutions, but they involve imaginary numbers. So this actually has no real\\nsolutions, we're taking the square root of a negative\\nnumber. So the b squared with the b\\nsquared minus 4ac, if this term right here is negative,\\nthen you're not going to have any real solutions. And let's verify that\\nfor ourselves. Let's get our graphic calculator\\nout and let's graph this equation right here. So, let's get the graphs that y\\nis equal to-- that's what I had there before --3x squared\\nplus 6x plus 10. So that's the equation and we're\\ngoing to see where it intersects the x-axis. Where does it equal 0? So let me graph it. Notice, this thing just comes\\ndown and then goes back up. Its vertex is sitting here\\nabove the x-axis and it's upward-opening. It never intersects\\nthe x-axis. So at no point will this\\nexpression, will this function, equal 0. At no point will y equal\\n0 on this graph. So once again, the quadratic\\nformula seems to be working. Let's do one more example,\\nyou can never see enough examples here. And I want to do ones that are,\\nyou know, maybe not so obvious to factor. So let's say we get negative 3x\\nsquared plus 12x plus 1 is equal to 0. Now let's try to do it just\\nhaving the quadratic formula in our brain. So the x's that satisfy this\\nequation are going to be negative b. This is b So negative b is\\nnegative 12 plus or minus the square root of b squared, of\\n144, that's b squared minus 4 times a, which is negative 3\\ntimes c, which is 1, all of that over 2 times a, over\\n2 times negative 3. So all of that over negative 6,\\nthis is going to be equal to negative 12 plus or\\nminus the square root of-- What is this? It's a negative times a negative\\nso they cancel out. So I have 144 plus 12, so\\nthat is 156, right? 144 plus 12, all of that\\nover negative 6. Now, I suspect we can\\nsimplify this 156. We could maybe bring\\nsome things out of the radical sign. So let's attempt to do that. So let's do a prime\\nfactorization of 156. Sometimes, this is the hardest\\npart, simplifying the radical. So 156 is the same thing\\nas 2 times 78. 78 is the same thing\\nas 2 times what? That's 2 times 39. So the square root of 156 is\\nequal to the square root of 2 times 2 times 39 or we could say\\nthat's the square root of 2 times 2 times the\\nsquare root of 39. And this, obviously, is just\\ngoing to be the square root of 4 or this is the square root\\nof 2 times 2 is just 2. 2 square roots of 39, if I\\ndid that properly, let's see, 4 times 39. Yeah, it looks like\\nit's right. So this up here will simplify to\\nnegative 12 plus or minus 2 times the square root of 39, all\\nof that over negative 6. Now we can divide the numerator\\nand the denominator maybe by 2. So this will be equal to\\nnegative 6 plus or minus the square root of 39\\nover negative 3. Or we could separate these\\ntwo terms out. We could say this is equal to\\nnegative 6 over negative 3 plus or minus the square root\\nof 39 over negative 3. Now, this is just a 2\\nright here, right? These cancel out, 6 divided\\nby 3 is 2, so we get 2. And now notice, if this is plus\\nand we use this minus sign, the plus will become\\nnegative and the negative will become positive. But it still doesn't\\nmatter, right? We could say minus or plus,\\nthat's the same thing as plus or minus the square root\\nof 39 nine over 3. I think that's about as simple\\nas we can get this answered. I want to make a very clear\\npoint of what I did that last step. I did not forget about\\nthis negative sign. I just said it doesn't matter. It's going to turn the positive\\ninto the negative; it's going to turn the negative\\ninto the positive. Let me rewrite this. So this right here can be\\nrewritten as 2 plus the square root of 39 over negative 3 or 2\\nminus the square root of 39 over negative 3, right? That's what the plus or minus\\nmeans, it could be this or that or both of them, really. Now in this situation, this\\nnegative 3 will turn into 2 minus the square root\\nof 39 over 3, right? I'm just taking this\\nnegative out. Here the negative and the\\nnegative will become a positive, and you get 2\\nplus the square root of 39 over 3, right? A negative times a negative\\nis a positive. So once again, you have\\n2 plus or minus the square of 39 over 3. 2 plus or minus the square\\nroot of 39 over 3 are solutions to this equation\\nright there. Let verify. I'm just curious what the\\ngraph looks like. So let's just look at it. Let me clear this. Where is the clear button? So we have negative 3 three\\nsquared plus 12x plus 1 and let's graph it. Let's see where it intersects\\nthe x-axis. It goes up there and then\\nback down again. So 2 plus or minus the square,\\nyou see-- The square root of 39 is going to be a little\\nbit more than 6, right? Because 36 is 6 squared. So it's going be a little bit\\nmore than 6, so this is going to be a little bit\\nmore than 2. A little bit more than 6 divided\\nby 2 is a little bit more than 2. So you're going to get one value\\nthat's a little bit more than 4 and then another value\\nthat should be a little bit less than 1. And that looks like the case,\\nyou have 1, 2, 3, 4. You have a value that's pretty\\nclose to 4, and then you have another value that is a little\\nbit-- It looks close to 0 but maybe a little bit\\nless than that. So anyway, hopefully you found\\nthis application of the quadratic formula helpful. \"),\n",

       "  \"Use the quadratic formula to\\nsolve the equation, negative x squared plus 8x is equal to 1. Now, in order to really use the\\nquadratic equation, or to figure out what our a's, b's and\\nc's are, we have to have our equation in the form, ax\\nsquared plus bx plus c is equal to 0. And then, if we know our a's,\\nb's, and c's, we will say that the solutions to this equation\\nare x is equal to negative b plus or minus the square root\\nof b squared minus 4ac-- all of that over 2a. So the first thing we have to\\ndo for this equation right here is to put it\\nin this form. And on one side of this\\nequation, we have a negative x squared plus 8x, so that looks\\nlike the first two terms. But our constant is on\\nthe other side. So let's get the constant on the\\nleft hand side and get a 0 here on the right hand side. So let's subtract 1 from both\\nsides of this equation. The left hand side of the\\nequation will become negative x squared plus 8x minus 1. And then the right hand\\nside, 1 minus 1 is 0. Now we have it in that form. We have ax squared\\na is negative 1. So let me write this down.\\na is equal to negative 1. a is equal to negative 1. It's implicit there, you could\\nput a 1 here if you like. A negative 1. Negative x squared is the same\\nthing as negative 1x squared. b is equal to 8. So b is equal to 8, that's\\nthe 8 right there. And c is equal to negative 1. That's the negative\\n1 right there. So now we can just apply\\nthe quadratic formula. The solutions to this equation\\nare x is equal to negative b. Plus or minus the square root\\nof b squared, of 8 squared, minus 4ac-- let me do it in that\\ngreen color --minus 4, the green is the part\\nof the formula. The colored parts are the things\\nthat we're substituting into the formula. Minus 4 times a, which is\\nnegative 1, times negative 1, times c, which is\\nalso negative 1. And then all of that-- let me\\nextend the square root sign a little bit further --all\\nof that is going to be over 2 times a. In this case a is negative 1. So let's simplify this. So this becomes negative 8, this\\nis negative 8, plus or minus the square root\\nof 8 squared is 64. And then you have a negative 1\\ntimes a negative 1, these just cancel out just to be a 1. So it's 64 minus is 4. That's just that 4 over there. All of that over negative 2. So this is equal to negative\\n8 plus or minus the square root of 60. All of that over negative 2. And let's see if we can\\nsimplify the radical expression here, the\\nsquare root of 60. Let's see, 60 is equal\\nto 2 times 30. 30 is equal to 2 times 15. And then 15 is 3 times 5. So we do have a perfect\\nsquare here. We do have a 2 times\\n2 in there. It is 2 times 2 times\\n15, or 4 times 15. So we could write, the square\\nroot of 60 is equal to the square root of 4 times the\\nsquare root of 15, right? The square root of 4 times\\nthe square root of 15, that's what 60 is. 4 times 15. And so this is equal to-- square\\nroot of 4 is 2 times the square of 15. So we can rewrite this\\nexpression, right here, as being equal to negative 8 plus\\nor minus 2 times the square root of 15, all of that\\nover negative 2. Now both of these terms right\\nhere are divisible by either 2 or negative 2. So let's divide it. So we have negative 8 divided\\nby negative 2, which is positive 4. So let me write it over here. Negative 8 divided by negative\\n2 is positive 4. And then you have this\\nweird thing. Plus or minus 2 divided\\nby negative 2. And really what we have\\nhere is 2 expressions. But if we're plus 2 and we\\ndivide by negative 2, it will be negative 1. And if we take negative 2 and\\ndivide by negative 2, we're going to have positive 1. So instead of plus or minus, you\\ncould imagine it is going to be minus or plus. But it's really the same thing. Right? It's really now minus or plus. If it was plus, it's now\\ngoing to be a minus. If it was a minus, it's now\\ngoing to be a plus. Minus or plus 2 times the\\nsquare root of 15. Or another way to view it is\\nthat the two solutions here are 4 minus two roots of 15,\\nand 4 plus two roots of 15. These are both values of x\\nthat'll satisfy this equation. And if this confuses you, what I\\ndid, turning a plus or minus into minus plus. Let me just take a little\\nbit of an aside there. I could write this expression\\nup here as two expressions. That's what the plus\\nor minus really is. There's a negative 8 plus 2\\nroots of 15 over negative 2. And then there's a negative\\n8 minus 2 roots of 15 over negative 2. This one simplifies to--\\nnegative 8 divided by negative 2 is 4. 2 divided by negative\\n2 is negative 1. 2 times a 4 minus the\\nsquare root of 15. And then over here you have\\nnegative 8 divided by negative 2, which is 4. And then negative 2 divided by\\nnegative 2, which is plus the square of 15. And I just realized I made\\na mistake up here. When we're dividing a 2 divided\\nby negative 2, we don't have this 2 over here. This is just a plus or\\nminus the root of 15. We just saw that when\\nI did it out here. So this is minus the\\nsquare root of 15. And this is plus the\\nsquare root of 15. So the two solutions for this\\nequation-- It's good that I took that little hiatus there,\\nthat little aside there. The two solutions could be 4\\nminus the square root of 15, or x, or and, x could be 4 plus\\nthe square root of 15. Either of those values of x\\nwill satisfy this original quadratic equation. \"),\n",

And actually, I'll\\nsolve it twice using the quadratic\\nformula to show you that as long as we manipulated\\nthis in the valid way, the quadratic\\nformula will give us the exact same roots or\\nthe exact same solutions to this equation. So in this form right over\\nhere, what are our ABCs? Let's just remind ourselves\\nwhat the quadratic formula even is actually. That's a good place to start. The quadratic formula\\ntells us that if we have a quadratic\\nequation in the form ax squared plus bx plus c is equal\\nto 0, so in standard form, then the roots of this are\\nx are equal to negative b plus or minus the\\nsquare root of b squared minus 4ac,\\nall of that over 2a.

This is actually giving\\nyou two solutions, because you have the\\npositive square root here and the negative square root. So let's apply it here in the\\ncase where-- in this case, a is equal to negative\\n3, b is equal to 10, and c is equal to negative 3. So applying the quadratic\\nformula right here, we get our solutions to be\\nx is equal to negative b. b is 10. So negative b is negative 10\\nplus or minus the square root of b squared. b is 10. So b squared is 100\\nminus 4 times a times c. So minus 4 times negative\\n3 times negative 3. Let me just write it down. Minus 4 times negative\\n3 times negative 3. All of that's under\\nthe radical sign. And then all of that is over 2a. So 2 times a is negative 6. So this is going to be\\nequal to negative 10 plus or minus the square root\\nof 100 minus-- negative 3 times negative 3 is positive 9. Positive 9 times\\n4 is positive 36. We have a minus sign out here. So minus 36. All of that over negative 6. This is equal to\\n100 minus 36 is 64. So negative 10 plus or\\nminus the square root of 64. All of that over negative 6. The principal square\\nroot of 64 is 8. But we're taking the positive\\nand negative square root. So this is negative 10 plus\\nor minus 8 over negative 6. So if we take the\\npositive version, we say x could be\\nequal to-- negative 10 plus 8 is negative\\n2 over negative 6. So that was taking\\nthe plus version. That's this right over here. And negative 2 over\\nnegative 6 is equal to 1/3. If we take the\\nnegative square root, negative 10 minus 8-- So let's\\ntake negative 10 minus 8. That would be x is equal\\nto-- negative 10 minus 8 is negative 18. And that's going to\\nbe over negative 6. Negative 18 divided by\\nnegative 6 is positive 3. So the two roots for\\nthis quadratic equation are positive 1/3 and positive 3. And I want to show you the\\nwe'll get the same answer, even if we manipulate this. Some people might\\nnot like the fact that our first coefficient\\nhere is a negative 3. Maybe they want a positive 3. So to get rid of\\nthat negative 3, they can multiply both sides of\\nthis equation times negative 1. And then if you did\\nthat, you would get 3x squared minus 10x plus 3 is\\nequal to 0 times negative 1, which is still equal to 0. So in this case, a is equal to\\n3, b is equal to negative 10, and c is equal to 3 again. And we could apply\\nthe quadratic formula. We get x is equal to\\nnegative b. b is negative 10. So negative negative\\n10 is positive 10, plus or minus\\nthe square root of b squared, which is\\nnegative 10 squared, which is 100, minus\\n4 times a times c. a times c is 9 times 4 is 36. So minus 36. All of that over 2 times a. All of that over 6. So this is equal to 10 plus or\\nminus the square root of 64, or really that's\\njust going to be 8. All of that over 6. If we add 8 here, we get\\n10 plus 8 is 18 over 6. We get x could be equal to 3. Or if we take the negative\\nsquare root or the negative 8 here, 10 minus 8 is 2. 2 over 6 is 1/3.

We could factor it and just\\nfigure out the values of x that satisfy it and\\njust count them. That will be the number\\nof solutions. We could just apply the\\nquadratic formula. But what I want to do here is\\nactually explore the quadratic formula, and think about how we\\ncan determine the number of solutions without even maybe\\nnecessarily finding them explicitly. So the quadratic formula tells\\nus that if we have an equation of the form ax squared plus bx\\nplus c is equal to 0, that the solutions are going to be-- or\\nthe solution if it exists is going to be-- negative b plus or\\nminus the square root of b squared minus 4ac. All of that over 2a. Now the reason why this can be\\n2 solutions is that we have a plus or minus here. If this b squared minus 4ac is\\na positive number-- so let's think about this a little bit. If b squared minus 4ac\\nis greater than 0, what's going to happen? Well, then it's a\\npositive number. It's going to have\\na square root. And then when you add it to\\nnegative b you're going to get one value for the numerator, and\\nwhen you subtract it from negative b you are going\\nto get another value in the numerator. So this is going to lead\\nto two solutions. Now what happens if b squared\\nminus 4ac is equal to 0? If this expression under the\\nradical is equal to 0, you're just going to have the\\nsquare root of 0. So it's going to be negative\\nb plus or minus 0. And it doesn't matter whether\\nyou add or subtract 0, you're going to get the same value. So in that situation, the\\nactual solution of the equation is going to be\\nnegative b over 2a. There's not going to be this\\nplus or minus, it's not going to be relevant. You're only going to\\nhave one solution. So if b squared minus 4ac\\nis equal to 0, you only have one solution. And then what happens if\\nb squared minus 4ac is less than 0? Well if b squared minus 4ac is\\nless than 0, this is going to be a negative number right here\\nand you're going to have to take the square root\\nof a negative number. And we know, from dealing with\\nreal numbers, you can't take the square root. There is no real number\\nsquared that becomes a negative number. So in this situation there is\\nno solutions, or no real-- when I say real I literally\\nmean a real number-- no real solution. So let's think about it\\nin the context of this equation right here. And just in case you're curious\\nif whether this expression right here,\\nb squared minus 4ac, has a name, it does. It's called the discriminant. This is the discriminant. That's that part of the\\nquadratic equation. It determines the number\\nof solutions we have. So if we want to figure out the\\nnumber of solutions for this equation, we don't have\\nto go through the whole quadratic equation, although\\nit's not that much work. We just have to evaluate\\nb squared minus 4ac. So what is b squared\\nminus 4ac? So b is right here, it's 14. So it's 14 squared minus 4 times\\na, which is 1, times c, which is 49. That c, right there, times 49. What's 14 times 14? Let me do it over here. 14 times 14. 4 times 4 is 16. 4 times 1 is 4. Plus 1 is 56. Put a 0. 1 times 14 is 14. It is 6, 9, 1. It's 196. So this right here is 196. And we can ignore the 1. What's 4 times 49? So 49 times 4. 4 times 9 is 36. 4 times 4 is 16 plus\\n3 is 190-- or is 19, so you get 196. So this right here is 196. So b squared minus 4ac\\nis 196 minus 196. So 196 minus 196\\nis equal to 0. So we're dealing with a\\nsituation where the discriminant is equal to 0. We only have one solution. And if you want, you could try\\nto find that one solution. This whole part is going to\\nbe the square root of 0. It's just going to be 0. So the solution is going to\\nbe negative b over 2a. And negative b is-- we\\ncould just solve it. Negative b is negative 14 over 2\\ntimes a. a is just 1 over 2. So it's equal to negative 7. That's the only solution\\nto this equation. But if you just wanted to know\\nhow many solutions, you just have to find out that b squared\\nminus 4ac is 0. So it's only going to\\nhave one solution. And there's other ways.

There has to be some number here\\nthat if I have my number squared I get that number, and\\nthen if I have two times my number I get negative 4. Remember that, and I\\nthink it'll become clear with a few examples. I want x squared minus 4x plus\\nsomething to be equal to x minus a squared. We don't know what a\\nis just yet, but we know a couple of things. When I square things-- so this\\nis going to be x squared minus 2a plus a squared. So if you look at this pattern\\nright here, that has to be-- sorry, x squared minus 2ax--\\nthis right here has to be 2ax. And this right here would\\nhave to be a squared. So this number, a is going to\\nbe half of negative 4, a has to be negative 2, right? Because 2 times a is going\\nto be negative 4. a is negative 2, and if a is\\nnegative 2, what is a squared? Well, then a squared is going\\nto be positive 4. And this might look all\\ncomplicated to you right now, but I'm showing you\\nthe rationale. You literally just look at this\\ncoefficient right here, and you say, OK, well what's\\nhalf of that coefficient? Well, half of that coefficient\\nis negative 2. So we could say a is equal to\\nnegative 2-- same idea there-- and then you square it. You square a, you\\nget positive 4. So we add positive 4 here. Add a 4. Now, from the very first\\nequation we ever did, you should know that you can never\\ndo something to just one side of the equation. You can't add 4 to just one\\nside of the equation. If x squared minus 4x was equal\\nto 5, then when I add 4 it's not going to be\\nequal to 5 anymore. It's going to be equal\\nto 5 plus 4. We added 4 on the left-hand side\\nbecause we wanted this to be a perfect square. But if you add something to the\\nleft-hand side, you've got to add it to the right-hand\\nside. And now, we've gotten ourselves\\nto a problem that's just like the problems we\\ndid in the last video. What is this left-hand side? Let me rewrite the\\nwhole thing. We have x squared minus 4x\\nplus 4 is equal to 9 now. All we did is add 4 to both\\nsides of the equation. But we added 4 on purpose so\\nthat this left-hand side becomes a perfect square. Now what is this? What number when I multiply it\\nby itself is equal to 4 and when I add it to itself I'm\\nequal to negative 2? Well, we already answered\\nthat question. It's negative 2. So we get x minus 2 times\\nx minus 2 is equal to 9. Or we could have skipped this\\nstep and written x minus 2 squared is equal to 9. And then you take the square\\nroot of both sides, you get x minus 2 is equal to\\nplus or minus 3. Add 2 to both sides, you get x\\nis equal to 2 plus or minus 3. That tells us that x could be\\nequal to 2 plus 3, which is 5. Or x could be equal to 2 minus\\n3, which is negative 1. And we are done. Now I want to be very clear. You could have done this without\\ncompleting the square. We could've started off\\nwith x squared minus 4x is equal to 5. We could have subtracted 5 from\\nboth sides and gotten x squared minus 4x minus\\n5 is equal to 0. And you could say, hey, if I\\nhave a negative 5 times a positive 1, then their product\\nis negative 5 and their sum is negative 4. So I could say this is x\\nminus 5 times x plus 1 is equal to 0. And then we would say that x is\\nequal to 5 or x is equal to negative 1. And in this case, this actually\\nprobably would have been a faster way to\\ndo the problem. But the neat thing about the\\ncompleting the square is it will always work. It'll always work no matter what\\nthe coefficients are or no matter how crazy\\nthe problem is. And let me prove it to you. Let's do one that traditionally\\nwould have been a pretty painful problem if\\nwe just tried to do it by factoring, especially if we\\ndid it using grouping or something like that. Let's say we had 10x squared\\nminus 30x minus 8 is equal to 0. Now, right from the get-go, you\\ncould say, hey look, we could maybe divide\\nboth sides by 2. That does simplify\\na little bit. Let's divide both sides by 2. So if you divide everything\\nby 2, what do you get? We get 5x squared minus 15x\\nminus 4 is equal to 0. But once again, now we have this\\ncrazy 5 in front of this coefficent and we would have to\\nsolve it by grouping which is a reasonably painful\\nprocess. But we can now go straight to\\ncompleting the square, and to do that I'm now going to divide\\nby 5 to get a 1 leading coefficient here. And you're going to see why this\\nis different than what we've traditionally done. So if I divide this whole thing\\nby 5, I could have just divided by 10 from the get-go\\nbut I wanted to go to this the step first just to show\\nyou that this really didn't give us much. Let's divide everything by 5. So if you divide everything by\\n5, you get x squared minus 3x minus 4/5 is equal to 0. So, you might say, hey, why did\\nwe ever do that factoring by grouping? If we can just always divide by\\nthis leading coefficient, we can get rid of that. We can always turn this into a 1\\nor a negative 1 if we divide by the right number. But notice, by doing that we\\ngot this crazy 4/5 here. So this is super hard to do\\njust using factoring. You'd have to say, what two\\nnumbers when I take the product is equal to\\nnegative 4/5? It's a fraction and when I take\\ntheir sum, is equal to negative 3? This is a hard problem\\nwith factoring. This is hard using factoring. So, the best thing to do is to\\nuse completing the square. So let's think a little bit\\nabout how we can turn this into a perfect square. What I like to do-- and you'll\\nsee this done some ways and I'll show you both ways because\\nyou'll see teachers do it both ways-- I like to get\\nthe 4/5 on the other side. So let's add 4/5 to both\\nsides of this equation. You don't have to do it this\\nway, but I like to get the 4/5 out of the way. And then what do we get\\nif we add 4/5 to both sides of this equation? The left-hand hand side of the\\nequation just becomes x squared minus 3x,\\nno 4/5 there. I'm going to leave a little\\nbit of space. And that's going to\\nbe equal to 4/5. Now, just like the last problem,\\nwe want to turn this left-hand side into the perfect\\nsquare of a binomial. How do we do that? Well, we say, well, what number\\ntimes 2 is equal to negative 3? So some number times\\n2 is negative 3. Or we essentially just take\\nnegative 3 and divide it by 2, which is negative 3/2. And then we square\\nnegative 3/2. So in the example, we'll\\nsay a is negative 3/2. And if we square negative\\n3/2, what do we get? We get positive 9/4. I just took half of this\\ncoefficient, squared it, got positive 9/4. The whole purpose of doing that\\nis to turn this left-hand side into a perfect square. Now, anything you do to one side\\nof the equation, you've got to do to the other side. So we added a 9/4 here, let's\\nadd a 9/4 over there. And what does our\\nequation become? We get x squared minus 3x plus\\n9/4 is equal to-- let's see if we can get a common\\ndenominator. So, 4/5 is the same\\nthing as 16/20. Just multiply the numerator\\nand denominator by 4. Plus over 20. 9/4 is the same thing\\nif you multiply the numerator by 5 as 45/20. And so what is 16 plus 45? You see, this is kind of getting\\nkind of hairy, but that's the fun, I guess, of completing the square sometimes. 16 plus 45. See that's 55, 61. So this is equal to 61/20. So let me just rewrite it. x squared minus 3x plus\\n9/4 is equal to 61/20. Crazy number. Now this, at least on\\nthe left hand side, is a perfect square. This is the same thing as\\nx minus 3/2 squared. And it was by design. Negative 3/2 times negative\\n3/2 is positive 9/4. Negative 3/2 plus negative 3/2\\nis equal to negative 3. So this squared is\\nequal to 61/20. We can take the square root of\\nboth sides and we get x minus 3/2 is equal to the positive\\nor the negative square root of 61/20. And now, we can add 3/2 to both\\nsides of this equation and you get x is equal to\\npositive 3/2 plus or minus the square root of 61/20. And this is a crazy number and\\nit's hopefully obvious you would not have been able to-- at\\nleast I would not have been able to-- get to this number\\njust by factoring. And if you want their actual\\nvalues, you can get your calculator out. And then let me clear\\nall of this. And 3/2-- let's do the plus\\nversion first. So we want to do 3 divided by 2 plus the\\nsecond square root. We want to pick that little\\nyellow square root. So the square root of 61 divided\\nby 20, which is 3.24. This crazy 3.2464, I'll\\njust write 3.246. So this is approximately equal\\nto 3.246, and that was just the positive version. Let's do the subtraction\\nversion. So we can actually put our\\nentry-- if you do second and then entry, that we want that\\nlittle yellow entry, that's why I pressed the\\nsecond button. So I press enter, it puts in\\nwhat we just put, we can just change the positive or the\\naddition to a subtraction and you get negative 0.246. So you get negative 0.246. And you can actually verify\\nthat these satisfy our original equation. Our original equation\\nwas up here. Let me just verify\\nfor one of them. So the second answer on your\\ngraphing calculator is the last answer you use. So if you use a variable answer,\\nthat's this number right here. So if I have my answer squared--\\nI'm using answer represents negative 0.24. Answer squared minus 3 times\\nanswer minus 4/5-- 4 divided by 5-- it equals--. And this just a little\\nbit of explanation. This doesn't store the entire\\nnumber, it goes up to some level of precision. It stores some number\\nof digits. So when it calculated it using\\nthis stored number right here, it got 1 times 10 to\\nthe negative 14. So that is 0.0000. So that's 13 zeroes\\nand then a 1. A decimal, then 13\\nzeroes and a 1. So this is pretty much 0. Or actually, if you got the\\nexact answer right here, if you went through an infinite\\nlevel of precision here, or maybe if you kept it in this\\nradical form, you would get that it is indeed equal to 0. So hopefully you found that\\nhelpful, this whole notion of completing the square. Now we're going to extend it\\nto the actual quadratic formula that we can use, we\\ncan essentially just plug things into to solve any\\nquadratic equation. \"),\n",

       "  \"Use completing the square to\\nfind the value of c that makes x squared minus 44x plus c--\\nso we can just figure out a c-- that makes it a perfect\\nsquare trinomial-- and a trinomial is just a polynomial\\nwith three terms here. Then write the expression as\\nthe square of a binomial. So we have x squared\\nminus 44x plus c. So how do we make this into\\na perfect square? Well, if you just look at the\\ntraditional pattern for a perfect square, let's\\njust think of it in terms of x plus a squared. That's the same thing as x plus\\na times x plus a, and we've seen this before. And if you were to multiply this\\nout, that's x times x, which is x squared, plus\\nx times a, which is ax. Plus a times x, which is ax. Plus a times a, which\\nis a squared. So it's x squared plus 2ax,\\nthese two, you have an ax plus an ax gives you 2ax,\\nplus a squared. So if we can get this into this\\npattern, where I have whatever value is here, if\\nI take half of it, right? This is going to be 2a here. If I take half of it and square\\nit over here, then this will be a perfect square. So if we look over here, this\\nthing right here is 2a, if we want to pattern match, if we\\nwant to make this look like a perfect square. That has to be 2a. So negative 44 is equal to 2a. And this, right here, this c, if\\nwe pattern match, c has to be equal to a squared. So what's a? Well, if we know negative 44\\nis 2a, we can divide both sides of that by 2. And we know that negative 22\\nhas got to be equal to a. a has got to be equal\\nto negative 22. a is half of the coefficient\\nright here. It's half of negative 44. And whenever you complete the\\nsquare, it's always going to be half of the coefficient\\nright here. Now, if that's a, what\\ndoes c need to be? Well, c needs to be a squared\\nin order for this to be a perfect square. So c needs to equal negative\\n22 squared. And we can figure out\\nwhat that is. 22 times 22, we could put the\\nnegative later-- actually it's just going to be the same thing\\nbecause the negative times a negative\\nis a positive. 2 times 22 is 44, put a 0. 2 times 22 is 44. Get a 4, get an 8, get a 4. So it's 484. So if we were to rewrite this\\nas x squared minus 44x plus 484, then this is a perfect\\nsquare trinomial. Or we could write\\nit like this. This is x squared minus 2\\ntimes-- or maybe I should write it this way-- plus 2\\ntimes negative 22x plus negative 22 squared. And when you view it that way,\\nit's pretty clear that this is a perfect square, and if you\\nwere to factor it, it's the same thing as x minus\\n22 times x minus 22, or x minus 22 squared. These are all equivalent\\nstatements. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] Let's\\nsee if we can take this quadratic expression here, X\\nsquared plus 16 X plus nine and write it in this form. You might be saying, hey Sal, why do I even need to worry about this? And one, it is just\\ngood algebraic practice to be able to manipulate things, but as we'll see in the\\nfuture, what we're about to do is called completing the square. It's a really valuable\\ntechnique for solving quadratics and it's actually the basis for the proof of the quadratic formula which\\nyou'll learn in the future. So it's actually a pretty\\ninteresting technique. So how do we write this in this form? Well one way to think about\\nis if we expanded this X plus A squared, we know if\\nwe square X plus A it would be X squared plus two A X plus A squared, and then you still have that\\nplus B, right over there. So one way to think about it is, let's take this expression, this X squared plus 16 X plus nine, and I'm just gonna write\\nit with a few spaces in it. X squared plus 16 X and then plus nine, just like that. And so, if we say alright,\\nwe have an X squared here. We have an X squared here. If we say that two A X is\\nthe same thing as that, then what's A going to be? So this is two A times X. Well, that means two A is 16 or that A is equal to 8. And so if I want to have\\nan A squared over here, well if A is eight, I\\nwould add an eight squared which would be a 64. Well I can't just add numbers\\nwilly nilly to an expression without changing the\\nvalue of an expression so if don't want to change\\nthe value of the expression, I still need to subtract 64. So notice, all that I have done now, is I just took our original expression and I added 64 and I subtracted 64, so I have not changed the\\nvalue of that expression. But what was valuable about me doing that, is now this first part of the expression, this part right over here, it fits the pattern of a perfect square quadratic right over here. We have X squared plus\\ntwo A X, where A is 8, plus A squared, 64. Once again, how did I get 64? I took half of the 16 and I\\nsquared it to get to the 64. And so the stuff that I just squared off, this is going to be X plus eight squared. X plus eight, squared. Once again I know that because\\nA is eight, A is eight, so this is X plus eight squared, and then all of this business\\non the right hand side. What is nine minus 64? Well 64 minus nine is 55, so this is going to be negative 55. So minus 55, and we're done. We've written this\\nexpression in this form, and what's also called completing the square. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Voiceover] So let\\'s see if we can solve this quadratic equation right over here: x squared minus two x minus eight is equal to zero. And actually, they\\'re cutting\\ndown some trees outside, so my apologies if you hear\\nsome chopping of trees. I\\'ll try to ignore it myself. All right. So back to the problem at hand, and there\\'s actually several ways that you could attack this problem. We could just try to\\nfactor the left-hand side and go that way, but the\\nway we\\'re going to tackle it is by completing the square. Now what does that mean? Well that means that I wanna write, I wanna write the left-hand\\nside of this equation into the form x plus a squared plus b, and we\\'ll see if we can write\\nthe left-hand in this form that we can actually solve it in a pretty straightforward way. So let\\'s see if we could do that. Well let\\'s just remind ourselves how we need to rearrange\\nthe left-hand side in order to get to this form. If I were to expand out x plus a squared, let me do that in a different color. So if I were to expand\\nout x plus a squared, that is x squared plus two a x, I\\'ll make that plus sign you can see, plus two a x, plus a squared, and of course you still have\\nthat plus b there, plus b. So let\\'s see if we can\\nwrite this in that form. So, what I\\'m going to do, this is what you typically do when you try to complete the square. All right. The x squared minus two x. Now I\\'m gonna have a little bit of a gap and I\\'m gonna have minus eight, and I have another a little bit of a gap and I\\'m gonna say equals zero. So I just rewrote this equation, but I gave myself some space so I can add or subtract some things that might make it a little bit easier to get into this form. So, if we just match our terms, x squared, x squared, two a x, negative two x. So, if this is two a x, that means that two a is negative two, two a is equal to negative two or a is equal to negative one. Another way to think about it, your a is going to be half of\\nyour first degree coefficient or the coefficient on the x term. So the coefficient of the\\nx term is a negative two, half of that is a negative one. And then we wanna have, and then we want to have an a squared. So if a is negative one, a\\nsquared would be plus one. So let\\'s throw a plus one there. But like we\\'ve done and said before, we can\\'t just willy-nilly add something on one side of equation\\nwithout adding it to the other or without subtracting it\\nagain on that same side. Otherwise, you\\'re fundamentally changing the truth of the equation. So if I add one on that side,\\nI even have to add one on the, if I add one of the left side, I even have to add one on the right side to make the equation still hold true or I could add one and subtract\\none from the left-hand side, so I\\'m not really changing the\\nvalue of the left-hand side. All I\\'ve done is added one and subtracted one from\\nthe left-hand side. Now why did I do this again? Well now, I\\'ve been able, I haven\\'t changed its value. I just added and\\nsubtracted the same thing, but this part of the left-hand side now matches this pattern right over here, x squared plus two a x, where a is negative one,\\nso it\\'s minus two x, plus a squared, plus negative one squared and then this, this part right over here is the plus b. So we already know that b\\nis equal to negative nine. Negative eight minus one is negative nine, and so that\\'s going to be\\nour b right over there. And so we can rewrite this as, what I squared off in green, that\\'s gonna be x plus a squared. So we could write it as x plus and I could write a is negative one. Actually, let me, I could\\nwrite it like that first. x plus a squared or x plus negative one. Well, let\\'s just x minus one,\\nso I\\'m just gonna write it as x minus negative one squared and then we have minus nine, minus nine is equal to zero, is equal to zero. And then I can add nine to both side, so I just have this squared expression on the left-hand side, so let\\'s do that. Let me add nine to both sides. And what I am going to be\\nleft with, so let me just, on the left-hand side, those cancel out. That\\'s why added the nine. I\\'m just gonna be left with\\nthe x minus one squared. It\\'s going to be equal to, on this side, zero plus nine is nine. So if x minus one, let\\nme do that in blue color. So, it\\'s gonna be nine. And so if x minus one squared is nine, if I have something\\nsquare is equal to nine, that means that that something\\nis either going to be the positive or the negative\\nsquare root of nine. So it\\'s either gonna be\\npositive or negative three. So we can say x minus one\\nis equal to positive three or x minus one is equal to negative three and you could see that here. If x minus one is three,\\nthree squared is nine. If x minus one is negative three, negative three squared is nine. And so here, we can just add one to both sides of this equation, add one to both sides of this equation, and you get x is equal to four or x is, if we add one to\\nboth sides of this equation, we get, my digital ink is\\nacting up, I don\\'t know. All right. Then we get x is\\nequal to negative three plus one is negative two. So, x could be equal to four or x could be equal to\\nnegative two, and we\\'re done. Now, some of you might be saying, \"Well, why did we go through the trouble \"of completing the square? \"I might have been able\\nto just factor this \"and then solve it that way.\" And you could have, actually,\\nfor this particular problem. Completing the square is very powerful because you could actually\\nalways apply this, and in the future, what you will learn in the quadratic formula and the quadratic formula\\nactually comes directly out of completing the square. In fact, when you\\'re applying\\nhe quadratic formula, you\\'re essentially applying the result of completing the square. So hopefully you found that fun. '),\n",

       "  '- [Instructor] So we\\'re\\ngiven this equation here. And what I want you to\\ndo is pause this video and see if you can solve it. What x values satisfy the equation? All right, now let\\'s work\\nthrough this together. So one technique could be just, let\\'s just try to complete the square here on the left-hand side. So to do that, let me write it this way, x squared minus eight x. And then I have, I\\'ll write the plus one out here, is equal to 85. Now if I wanna complete the square, I just have to think, \"What can I add to both\\nsides of this equation \"that could make this part\\nof the left-hand expression \"a perfect square?\" Well, if I look at this\\nnegative eight coefficient on the first-degree term, I could say, \"Okay, let me take half\\nof negative eight.\" That would be negative four. And then, negative four squared\\nis going to be positive 16. So I\\'m gonna add positive\\n16 on the left-hand side. And if I want, I could then subtract a 16 from the left-hand side. Or I could add a 16 on\\nthe right-hand side. Notice, I\\'ve just done the same thing to both sides of this equation. And why was that useful? Well, now what I\\'ve just put in parentheses is a perfect square. This is the same thing\\nas x minus four squared. It was by design. We looked at that negative eight. Half of that is negative four. You square it, you get 16. And you can verify, x minus\\nfour times x minus four is, indeed, equal to this. And then we have plus one is going to be equal to, what\\'s 85 plus 16? That is 101. And now we wanna get rid of this one on the left-hand side. And the easiest way we\\ncan do that is subtract one from both sides. That way we\\'ll just isolate\\nthat x minus four squared. And we are left with x minus four squared. Four squared, these cancel out, is going to be equal to 100. Now if something squared is equal to 100, that means that the something is equal to the positive or the negative\\nsquare root of a hundred. Or that that something,\\nx minus four, is equal to positive or negative 10. Positive or negative 10. All I did is took the plus or minus square root of a hundred. And this makes sense. If I took positive 10\\nsquared, I\\'ll get a hundred. If I take negative 10\\nsquared, I get a hundred. So x minus four could\\nbe either one of those. And now I just add four to\\nboth sides of the equation. And then what do I get? I get x is equal to four plus or minus 10. Or another way of thinking about it, I could write it as x is equal to, four plus 10 is 14. And then four minus 10\\nis equal to negative six. So these are two ways to solve it. But there\\'s other ways\\nto solve this equation. We could, right from the get-go, try to subtract 85 from both sides. Some people feel more\\ncomfortable solving quadratics if they have that quadratic\\nexpression be equal to zero. And if you did that, you\\nwould get x squared minus eight x minus 84 is equal to zero. All I did is I subtracted\\n85 from both sides of this equation to get\\nthis right over here. Now this one we can approach\\nin two different ways. We can complete the square again. Or we could just try to factor. If we complete the square, we\\'re going to see something\\nvery similar to this. Actually, let me just do that really fast. If I look at this part, right over there, I could say x squared minus eight x. And then once again, half of negative eight is negative four. That squared is plus 16. And then I\\'d have minus 84. So let me do that in that blue color so we can keep track. Minus 84. And then if I added 16\\non the left-hand side, I could either add that\\nto the right-hand side so both sides have 16 added to it. Or if I wanna maintain the equality, I could just subtract 16\\nfrom the left-hand side. So I\\'ve added 16, subtracted 16. I haven\\'t changed the\\nleft-hand side\\'s value. And then that would be equal to zero. This part right over here, this is x minus four squared. This part right over here is minus 100 is equal to zero. And then you add a hundred\\nto both sides of this and you get exactly this\\nstep right over here. Now another way that we\\ncould\\'ve approached it without completing the square. We could\\'ve said x squared minus eight x minus 84 is equal to zero. And think about what two numbers if I multiply them I get negative 84. So they\\'d have to have different signs, since when I take their product\\nI get a negative number. And when I add them together\\nI get negative eight. And there we could just\\nlook at the factorization of negative 84, of 84 generally. It could be two times,\\nlet\\'s just think about 84. 84 could be two times 42. And obviously, one of them\\nwould have to be negative, one of them would have to be positive in order to get to negative 84. But the difference\\nbetween these two numbers, if one was positive\\nand one was negative is a lot more than eight. So that doesn\\'t work. So let\\'s try, let\\'s see,\\nI\\'ll do a few in my head. Three times 28. But still that difference\\nis way more than eight. Four times, four times,\\nlet\\'s see, (mumbles). Four times 21, no, that difference between four and 21 is\\nstill larger than eight. Let\\'s see, five doesn\\'t go into it. Six times 14, that\\'s interesting now. Okay, so let\\'s think about this. So six times 14 is equal to 84. One of them has to be negative. And since when we take the\\nsum of the two numbers, we get a negative number, that means the larger one is negative. So let\\'s see, six times\\nnegative 14 is negative 84. Six plus negative 14 is, indeed, equal to negative eight. So we can factor this as x plus six times x minus 14 is equal to zero. And so the product of those\\ntwo things is equal to zero. That means if either of\\nthem is equal to zero, that would make the entire\\nexpression equal to zero. So we could say x plus\\nsix is equal to zero. Or x minus 14 is equal to zero. Subtract six from both sides here. We get x is equal to negative six. Or add 14 to both sides here. Or x is equal to 14. Exactly what we got up here. '),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Let's say we're told that zero is equal to x\\nsquared plus six x plus three, what is an x or what our x is that would satisfy this equation? Pause this video and try to figure it out. All right, now let's\\nwork through it together. So the first thing that I would try to do is see if I could factor\\nthis right hand expression, I have some expression,\\nit's equal to zero. So if I could factor it,\\nthat might help solve. So let's see, can I think of two numbers that when I add them, I get six, and when I take their\\nproduct, I get positive three? Well, if I'm thinking\\njust in terms of integers, three is a prime number, it only has two factors one and three. And let's see one plus\\nthree is not equal to six, so it doesn't look like factoring\\nis going to help me much. So the next thing I'll turn\\nto is completing the square. In fact, completing the square if there are x values that\\nwould satisfy this equation, completing the square\\nwill help us solve it. And the way I do it, I'll\\nsay zero is equal to, let me rewrite the first\\npart, x squared plus six x, and then I'm gonna write\\nthe plus three out here. And my goal is to add something to the right-hand\\nexpression, right over here, and then I'm gonna\\nsubtract that same thing, so I'm not really changing the\\nvalue of the right-hand side. And I wanna add something here that I'm later going to subtract, so that what I have in\\nparentheses is a perfect square. Well, the way to make it a perfect square, and we've talked about\\nthis in other videos when we introduced ourselves\\nto completing the square, is we'll look at this first degree coefficient right over\\nhere, this positive six, and say, okay, half of\\nthat is positive three, and if we were to square\\nthat, we would get nine. So let's add a nine there. And then we could also subtract a nine. Notice, we haven't changed the value of the right-hand side expression, we're adding nine and\\nwe're subtracting nine. And actually, the parentheses\\nare just there to help it make a little bit more\\nvisually clear to us, but you don't even need the parentheses, you would essentially get the same result. But then what happens if we\\nsimplify this a little bit? Well, what I just showed you, let me do it in this green blue color, this thing can be rewritten\\nas x plus three squared. That's why we added nine there, we said, all right, we're\\ngonna be dealing with a three 'cause three is half of six. And if we squared three,\\nwe get a nine there. And then this second\\npart, right over here, three minus nine, that's\\nequal to negative six. So we could write it like this, zero is equal to x plus\\nthree squared minus six. And now what we can do is\\nisolate this x plus three squared by adding six to both\\nsides, so let's do that. Let's add six there, let's add six there. And what we get on the left-hand side, we get six is equal to,\\non the right-hand side, we just get x plus three squared. And now we can take the\\nsquare root of both sides, and we could say that the plus\\nor minus square root of six is equal to x plus three. And if this doesn't make full sense, just pause the video a little\\nbit and think about it. If I'm saying that something\\nsquared is equal to six, that means that the something is either going to be the\\npositive square root of six, or the negative square root of six. And so now we can, if\\nwe wanna solve for x, we can just subtract\\nthree from both sides. So let's subtract three from\\nboth sides, and what do we get? We get on the right-hand side,\\nwe just are left with an x, and that's going to be\\nequal to negative three plus or minus the square root of six. And we are done. And obviously we could\\nrewrite this and say, x could be equal to negative three plus the square root of six, or x could be equal to negative three minus the square root of six. \"),\n",

       "  \"We're asked to\\ncomplete the square to solve 4x squared plus\\n40x minus 300 is equal to 0. So let me just rewrite it. So 4x squared plus 40x\\nminus 300 is equal to 0. So just as a first\\nstep here, I don't like having this 4 out\\nfront as a coefficient on the x squared term. I'd prefer if that was a 1. So let's just divide both\\nsides of this equation by 4. So let's just divide\\neverything by 4. So this divided\\nby 4, this divided by 4, that divided by 4,\\nand the 0 divided by 4. Just dividing both sides by 4. So this will simplify\\nto x squared plus 10x. And I can obviously\\ndo that, because as long as whatever I do\\nto the left hand side, I also do the right\\nhand side, that will make the equality\\ncontinue to be valid. So that's why I can do that. So 40 divided by 4 is 10x. And then 300 divided\\nby 4 is what? That is 75. Let me verify that. 4 goes into 30 seven times. 7 times 4 is 28. You subtract, you\\nget a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0. 4 goes into 20 five times. 5 times 4 is 20. Subtract zero. So it goes 75 times. This is minus 75 is equal to 0. And right when you look at\\nthis, just the way it's written, you might try to factor\\nthis in some way. But it's pretty clear this\\nis not a complete square, or this is not a perfect\\nsquare trinomial. Because if you look at\\nthis term right here, this 10, half of this 10 is 5. And 5 squared is not 75. So this is not a perfect square. So what we want to\\ndo is somehow turn whatever we have on\\nthe left hand side into a perfect square. And I'm going to start out by\\nkind of getting this 75 out of the way. You'll sometimes\\nsee it where people leave the 75 on\\nthe left hand side. I'm going to put on\\nthe right hand side just so it kind of clears\\nthings up a little bit. So let's add 75 to both\\nsides to get rid of the 75 from the left hand\\nside of the equation. And so we get x squared plus\\n10x, and then negative 75 plus 75. Those guys cancel out. And I'm going to\\nleave some space here, because we're going\\nto add something here to complete the square\\nthat is equal to 75. So all I did is add 75 to\\nboth sides of this equation. Now, in this step,\\nthis is really the meat of\\ncompleting the square. I want to add something to\\nboth sides of this equation. I can't add to only one\\nside of the equation. So I want to add something to\\nboth sides of this equation so that this left hand side\\nbecomes a perfect square. And the way we can do that,\\nand saw this in the last video where we constructed a\\nperfect square trinomial, is that this last\\nterm-- or I should say, what we see on\\nthe left hand side, not the last term, this expression\\non the left hand side, it will be a perfect square if\\nwe have a constant term that is the square of half of the\\ncoefficient on the first degree term. So the coefficient here is 10. Half of 10 is 5. 5 squared is 25. So I'm going to add 25\\nto the left hand side. And of course, in order to\\nmaintain the equality, anything I do the left hand\\nside, I also have to do to the right hand side. And now we see that this\\nis a perfect square. We say, hey, what two numbers\\nif I add them I get 10 and when I multiply\\nthem I get 25? Well, that's 5 and 5. So when we factor this, what\\nwe see on the left hand side simplifies to, this\\nis x plus 5 squared. x plus 5 times x plus 5. And you can look at\\nthe videos on factoring if you find that confusing. Or you could look\\nat the last video on constructing perfect\\nsquare trinomials. I encourage you to\\nsquare this and see that you get exactly this. And this will be equal to 75\\nplus 25, which is equal to 100. And so now we're saying\\nthat something squared is equal to 100. So really, this is\\nsomething right over here-- if I say something squared\\nis equal to 100, that means that that something is\\none of the square roots of 100. And we know that 100\\nhas two square roots. It has positive 10 and\\nit has negative 10. So we could say that x\\nplus 5, the something that we were\\nsquaring, that must be one of the square roots of 100. So that must be equal to the\\nplus or minus square root of 100, or plus or minus 10. Or we could separate it out. We could say that x\\nplus 5 is equal to 10, or x plus 5 is equal\\nto negative 10. On this side right\\nhere, I can just subtract 5 from both\\nsides of this equation and I would get-- I'll\\njust write it out. Subtracting 5 from both\\nsides, I get x is equal to 5. And over here, I\\ncould subtract 5 from both sides again-- I\\nsubtracted 5 in both cases-- subtract 5 again and I can\\nget x is equal to negative 15. So those are my two\\nsolutions that I got to solve this equation. We can verify that they actually\\nwork, and I'll do that in blue. So let's try with 5. I'll just do one of them. I'll leave the\\nother one for you. I'll leave the other one for\\nyou to verify that it works. So 4 times x squared. So 4 times 25 plus\\n40 times 5 minus 300 needs to be equal to 0. 4 times 25 is 100. 40 times 5 is 200. We're going to\\nsubtract that 300. 100 plus 200 minus 300,\\nthat definitely equals 0. So x equals 5 worked. And I think you'll find that\\nx equals negative 15 will also work when you substitute it\\ninto this right over here. \"),\n",

       "  \"Use completing the square\\nto find the roots of the quadratic equation right here. And when anyone talks about\\nroots, this just means find the x's where y is equal to 0. That's what a root is. A root is an x value that will\\nmake this quadratic function equal 0, that will\\nmake y equal 0. So to find the x's, let's\\njust make y equal 0 and then solve for x. So we get 0 is equal to 4x\\nsquared plus 40x, plus 280. Now, the first step that we\\nmight want to do, just because it looks like all three of these\\nterms are divisible by 4, is just divide both sides\\nof this equation by 4. That'll make our math a\\nlittle bit simpler. So let's just divide everything\\nby 4 here. If we just divide everything by\\n4, we get 0 is equal to x squared plus 10x, plus-- 280\\ndivided by 4 is 70-- plus 70. Now, they say use completing the\\nsquare, and actually, let me write that 70 a little bit\\nfurther out, and you'll see why I did that in a second. So let me just write a plus 70\\nover here, just to have kind of an awkward space here. And you'll see what I'm about\\nto do with this space, that has everything to do with\\ncompleting the square. So they say use completing the\\nsquare, which means, turn this, if you can, into\\na perfect square. Turn at least part of this\\nexpression into a perfect square, and then we can use that\\nto actually solve for x. So how do we turn this into\\na perfect square? Well, we have a 10x here. And we know that we can turn\\nthis into a perfect square trinomial if we take 1/2 of the\\n10, which is 5, and then we square that. So 1/2 of 10 is 5, you square\\nit, you add a 25. Now, you can't just willy-nilly\\nadd a 25 to one side of the equation without\\ndoing something to the other, or without just subtracting\\nthe 25 right here. Right? Think about it, I have not\\nchanged the equation. I've added 25 and I've\\nsubtracted 25. So I've added nothing to\\nthe right-hand side. I could add a billion and\\nsubtract a billion and not change the equation. So I have not changed the\\nequation at all right here. But what I have done is I've\\nmade it possible to express these three terms as\\na perfect square. That right there,\\n2 times 5 is 10. 5 squared is 25. So that is x plus 5 squared. And if you don't believe\\nme, multiply it out. You're going to have an x\\nsquared plus 5x, plus 5x, which will give you 10x, plus\\n5 squared, which is 25. So those first three terms\\nbecome that, and then the second two terms, right there,\\nyou just add them. Let's see, negative\\n25 plus 70. Let's see, negative 20 plus 70\\nwould be positive 50, and then you have another 5,\\nso it's plus 45. So we've just algebraically\\nmanipulated this equation. And we get 0 is equal to x\\nplus 5 squared, plus 45. Now, we could've, from the\\nbeginning if we wanted, we could've tried to factor it. But what we're going to do here,\\nthis will always work. Even if you have crazy decimal\\nnumbers here, you can solve for x using the method\\nwe're doing here, completing the square. So to solve for x, let's just\\nsubtract 45 from both sides of this equation. And so the left-hand side of\\nthis equation becomes negative 45, and the right-hand\\nside will be just the x plus 5 squared. These guys, right here,\\ncancel out. Now, normally if I look at\\nsomething like this I'll say, OK, let's just take the\\nsquare root of both sides of this equation. And so you might be tempted to\\ntake the square root of both sides of this equation, but\\nimmediately when you do that, you'll notice something\\nstrange. We're trying to take\\nthe square root of a negative number. And if we're dealing with real\\nnumbers, which is everything we've dealt with so far, you\\ncan't take a square root of a negative number. There is no real number that if\\nyou square it will give you a negative number. So it's not possible-- I don't\\ncare what you make x-- it is not possible to add x to\\n5 and square it, and get a negative number. So there is no x that can\\nsatisfy-- if we assume that is x is a real number-- that can\\nsatisfy this equation. Because I don't care what x you\\nput here, what real x you put here, you add 5 to it, you\\nsquare it, there's no way you're going to get\\na negative number. So there's no x that can satisfy\\nthis equation, so we could say there are no-- and\\nI'm using the word real because in Algebra 2 you'll\\nlearn that there are things called complex numbers, but\\ndon't worry about that right now-- but there no real roots\\nto the quadratic equation.

       "  \"In the last video, I told you\\nthat if you had a quadratic equation of the form ax squared\\nplus bx, plus c is equal to zero, you could use the\\nquadratic formula to find the solutions to\\nthis equation. And the quadratic\\nformula was x. The solutions would be equal\\nto negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared\\nminus 4ac, all of that over 2a. And we learned how to use it. You literally just substitute\\nthe numbers a for a, b for b, c for c, and then it gives you\\ntwo answers, because you have a plus or a minus right there. What I want to do\\nin this video is actually prove it to you. Prove that using, essentially\\ncompleting the square, I can get from that to that\\nright over there. So the first thing I want to\\ndo, so that I can start completing the square from this\\npoint right here, is-- let me rewrite the equation\\nright here-- so we have ax-- let me do it in a different\\ncolor-- I have ax squared plus bx, plus c is equal to 0. So the first I want to do is\\ndivide everything by a, so I just have a 1 out here\\nas a coefficient. So you divide everything by a,\\nyou get x squared plus b over ax, plus c over a, is equal\\nto 0 over a, which is still just 0. Now we want to-- well, let me\\nget the c over a term on to the right-hand side,\\nso let's subtract c over a from both sides. And we get x squared plus b over\\na x, plus-- well, I'll just leave it blank there,\\nbecause this is gone now; we subtracted it from both sides--\\nis equal to negative c over a I left a space\\nthere so that we can complete the square. And you saw in the completing\\nthe square video, you literally just take 1/2 of this\\ncoefficient right here and you square it. So what is b over\\na divided by 2? Or what is 1/2 times b over a? Well, that is just b over 2a,\\nand, of course, we are going to square it. You take 1/2 of this\\nand you square it. That's what we do in completing\\na square, so that we can turn this into the\\nperfect square of a binomial. Now, of course, we cannot just\\nadd the b over 2a squared to the left-hand side. We have to add it\\nto both sides. So you have a plus b over 2a\\nsquared there as well. Now what happens? Well, this over here, this\\nexpression right over here, this is the exact same thing as\\nx plus b over 2a squared. And if you don't believe me, I'm\\ngoing to multiply it out. That x plus b over 2a squared\\nis x plus b over 2a, times x plus b over 2a. x times\\nx is x squared. x times b over 2a is\\nplus b over 2ax. You have b over 2a times x,\\nwhich is another b over 2ax, and then you have b over 2a\\ntimes b over 2a, that is plus b over 2a squared. That and this are the same\\nthing, because these two middle terms, b over 2a plus b\\nover 2a, that's the same thing as 2b over 2ax, which is the\\nsame thing as b over ax. So this simplifies to x squared\\nplus b over ax, plus b over 2a squared, which is\\nexactly what we have written right there. That was the whole point of\\nadding this term to both sides, so it becomes\\na perfect square. So the left-hand side\\nsimplifies to this. The right-hand side, maybe\\nnot quite as simple. Maybe we'll leave it the\\nway it is right now. Actually, let's simplify\\nit a little bit. So the right-hand side,\\nwe can rewrite it. This is going to be equal\\nto-- well, this is going to be b squared. I'll write that term first. This\\nis b-- let me do it in green so we can follow along. So that term right there\\ncan be written as b squared over 4a square. And what's this term? What would that become? This would become-- in order\\nto have 4a squared as the denominator, we have to multiply\\nthe numerator and the denominator by 4a. So this term right\\nhere will become minus 4ac over 4a squared. And you can verify for yourself\\nthat that is the same thing as that. I just multiplied the\\nnumerator and the denominator by 4a. In fact, the 4's cancel out and\\nthen this a cancels out and you just have a c over a. So these, this and that\\nare equivalent. I just switched which I write\\nfirst. And you might already be seeing the beginnings of the\\nquadratic formula here. So this I can rewrite. This I can rewrite. The right-hand side, right\\nhere, I can rewrite as b squared minus 4ac, all of\\nthat over 4a squared. This is looking very close. Notice, b squared minus 4ac,\\nit's already appearing. We don't have a square root yet,\\nbut we haven't taken the square root of both\\nsides of this equation, so let's do that. So if you take the square root\\nof both sides, the left-hand side will just become x plus--\\nlet me scroll down a little bit-- x plus b over 2a is going\\nto be equal to the plus or minus square root\\nof this thing. And the square root of this\\nis the square root of the numerator over the square\\nroot of the denominator. So it's going to be the plus or\\nminus the square root of b squared minus 4ac over the\\nsquare root of 4a squared. Now, what is the square\\nroot of 4a squared? It is 2a, right? 2a squared is 4a squared. The square root of this\\nis that right here. So to go from here to here, I\\njust took the square root of both sides of this equation. Now, this is looking very\\nclose to the quadratic. We have a b squared minus\\n4ac over 2a, now we just essentially have to subtract\\nthis b over 2a from both sides of the equation and\\nwe're done. So let's do that. So if you subtract the b over\\n2a from both sides of this equation, what do you get? You get x is equal to negative\\nb over 2a, plus or minus the square root of b squared minus\\n4ac over 2a, common denominator. So this is equal\\nto negative b. Let me do this in a new color. So it's orange. Negative b plus or minus the\\nsquare root of b squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. And we are done! By completing the square with\\njust general coefficients in front of our a, b and c, we\\nwere able to derive the quadratic formula. Just like that.

       "  \"- [Instructor] In this video, we're gonna talk about\\na few of the pitfalls that someone might encounter while they're trying to solve a quadratic equation like this. Why is it a quadratic equation? Well, it's a quadratic because it has this second\\ndegree term right over here and it's an equation because\\nI have something on both sides of an equal sign. So one strategy that people might try is, well, I have something squared, why don't I just try to take\\nthe square root of both sides? And if you did that, you would get the square root of x squared\\nplus four x plus three is equal to the square\\nroot of negative one. And you immediately see a few problems. Even if this wasn't a negative one here, that's the most obvious problem. But even if this was\\na positive value here, how do you simplify or how do you somehow\\nisolate the x over here? You've pretty quickly hit a dead end. So just willy nilly, taking the square root of\\nboth sides of a quadratic is not going to be too helpful. So I'll put a big X over there. Another strategy that sometimes\\npeople will try to go for is to isolate the x squared first. So you could imagine, let me just rewrite it. X squared plus four x plus\\nthree is equal to negative one. They might say, let's\\nisolate that x squared by subtracting four x from both sides and subtracting three from both sides. And then what happens? On the left hand side, you do indeed isolate the x squared, and on the right hand side, you get negative four x minus four. And now, someone might say, if I take the square root of both sides, I could get, I'll just write that down. Square root of x squared is equal to, and you could try to take\\nthe plus of minus of one side to make sure you're\\nhitting the negative roots. Negative four x minus four. And you could get something like this, you would get x is equal to plus or minus the square root\\nof negative four x minus four, but this still doesn't help you. You still don't know what x is, and it's really not clear what to do with this algebraically. So this is yet another dead end. Now, there's some cases in which this strategy would have worked. In fact, it would have worked if you did not have\\nthis first degree term. If you did not have this\\nx term, so to speak. Then this strategy would have worked assuming that there are some solutions. But if you have an x term like this and it doesn't cancel out somehow, you know, if there was another\\nfour x on the other side, then you could subtract\\nfour x from both sides, and they would disappear. But if can't make these things disappear, this strategy that I've just outlined is not going to be a productive one. Now another strategy that\\nyou'll sometimes see people use, especially when they\\nsee something like this, let me rewrite it. X squared plus four x plus\\nthree is equal to negative one. They immediately go into factoring mode. They say, hey, wait, I think I\\nmight be able to factor this. I can think of two numbers\\nthat add up to four and whose product is three. Maybe three and one. And then they immediately factor\\nthis left hand expression, say that's going to be x plus three times x plus one, and then that's going to\\nbe equal to negative one. And then they either are\\nabout to make a mistake, this is actually algebraically valid. But they either make a mistake or they realize that\\nthey're at a dead end. Because just saying that\\nsomething times something is equal to negative one doesn't help you a ton. Because it's not clear\\nyet, how you'd solve for x. Another thing, try to do is, is they'll immediately say, okay, therefore x is\\nequal to negative three or x is equal to negative one because negative three will\\nmake this first term zero and negative one, or negative one would\\nmake the second term zero. But remember, this would only be true if you're multiplying two things and you got zero as their product, then the solutions would be anything that made either one of\\nthose terms equal to zero. But that's not what\\nwe're dealing with here. Here we're taking the product\\nis equal to negative one. So in order to factor like this and make headway in most cases, you're going to wanna have a zero on the right hand side over here. And that's also true if you're trying to apply\\nthe quadratic formula. A lot of folks would say, okay, I see a quadratic\\nequation right over here. Let me just apply the quadratic formula. They say, if I have something of the form ax squared plus bx plus\\nc is equal to zero. The quadratic formula would say that the roots are gonna be x is equal to negative b plus or minus the square root\\nof b squared minus four ac, all of that over two a. And so they'll immediately say, all right, I can recognize a here, as just being a one, there's a one coefficient\\nimplicitly there, b is four, c is three. And they'll say, okay, x\\nis equal to negative four plus or minus the square\\nroot of b squared, which is 16, minus four\\ntimes one, times three, all of that over two times one. But there's a problem. The quadratic formula applies when the left hand side is equal to zero. That's not what we have over here. So we're falling into that same pitfall. So everything I just did, none of this is a good idea. So the way to approach this, if you want zero over here, you wanna add one on the right hand side, and if you wanna maintain the equality, you have to add a one\\non the left hand side. And so you're going to get x squared plus four x plus\\nfour is equal to zero. And now you could use\\nthe quadratic formula or you could factor. You might recognize two\\nplus two is equal to four. Two times two is equal to four. So you could say x plus two times x plus two is equal to zero. And so in this case, you say, all right, x could be\\nequal to negative two or x could be equal to\\nnegative two. (chuckles) So this one only has one solution, x is equal to negative two. But the key is to recognize that you need the zero on\\nthe right hand side there, if you wanna use a quadratic formula or if you wanna use factoring\\nand the zero product property. \"),\n",

And a is the coefficient\\non the x squared term. So this is going to be\\nequal to b is negative 20. So it's negative\\n20 over 2 times 5. Well, this is going to\\nbe equal to positive 20 over 10, which is equal to 2. And so to find the y\\nvalue of the vertex, we just substitute\\nback into the equation. The y value is going\\nto be 5 times 2 squared minus 20 times 2 plus 15,\\nwhich is equal to let's see. This is 5 times 4, which is 20,\\nminus 40, which is negative 20, plus 15 is negative 5. So just like that, we're able\\nto figure out the coordinate. This coordinate right over here\\nis the point 2, negative 5. Now it's not so\\nsatisfying just to plug and chug a formula like this. And we'll see where\\nthis comes from when you look at the\\nquadratic formula. This is the first term. It's the x value that's\\nhalfway in between the roots. So that's one way\\nto think about it. But another way to do\\nit, and this probably will be of more lasting\\nhelp for you in your life, because you might\\nforget this formula. It's really just try to\\nre-manipulate this equation so you can spot\\nits minimum point. And we're going to do that\\nby completing the square. So let me rewrite that. And what I'll do is out\\nof these first two terms, I'll factor out a 5, because I\\nwant to complete a square here and I'm going to leave\\nthis 15 out to the right, because I'm going to have\\nto manipulate that as well. So it is 5 times x\\nsquared minus 4x. And then I have\\nthis 15 out here. And I want to write this\\nas a perfect square. And we just have\\nto remind ourselves that if I have x plus\\na squared, that's going to be x squared\\nplus 2ax plus a squared. So if I want to turn something\\nthat looks like this, 2ax, into a perfect\\nsquare, I just have to take half of this coefficient\\nand square it and add it right over here in order\\nto make it look like that. So I'm going to do\\nthat right over here. So if I take half of negative\\n4, that's negative 2. If I square it, that is\\ngoing to be positive 4. I have to be very careful here. I can't just willy nilly\\nadd a positive 4 here. I have equality here. If they were equal\\nbefore adding the 4, then they're not going to\\nbe equal after adding the 4. So I have to do proper\\naccounting here. I either have to add 4 to both\\nsides or I should be careful. I have to add the same\\namount to both sides or subtract the\\nsame amount again. Now, the reason why I\\nwas careful there is I didn't just add 4 to the right\\nhand side of the equation. Remember, the 4 is\\ngetting multiplied by 5. I have added 20 to the right\\nhand side of the equation. So if I want to make\\nthis balance out, if I want the equality\\nto still be true, I either have to\\nnow add 20 to y or I have to subtract 20 from\\nthe right hand side. So I'll do that. I'll subtract 20 from\\nthe right hand side. So I added 5 times 4. If you were to distribute\\nthis, you'll see that. I could have literally, up\\nhere, said hey, I'm adding 20 and I'm subtracting 20. This is the exact same\\nthing that I did over here. If you distribute the 5, it\\nbecomes 5x squared minus 20x plus 20 plus 15 minus 20. Exactly what's up here. The whole point of\\nthis is that now I can write this in\\nan interesting way. I could write this as y is equal\\nto 5 times x minus 2 squared, and then 15 minus 20 is minus 5. So the whole point of this is\\nnow to be able to inspect this. When does this equation\\nhit a minimum value? Well, we know that this\\nterm right over here is always going to\\nbe non-negative. Or we could say\\nit's always going to be greater than\\nor equal to 0. This whole thing is going\\nto hit a minimum value when this term is equal\\nto 0 or when x equals 2. When x equals 2, we're going\\nto hit a minimum value. And when x equals\\n2, what happens? Well, this whole term is 0\\nand y is equal to negative 5. The vertex is 2, negative 5. \"),\n",

       "  \"We're asked to graph\\nthe following equation y equals 5x squared\\nminus 20x plus 15. So let me get my\\nlittle scratch pad out. So it's y is equal to 5x\\nsquared minus 20x plus 15. Now there's many\\nways to graph this. You can just take three\\nvalues for x and figure out what the\\ncorresponding values for y are and just graph\\nthose three points. And three points actually\\nwill determine a parabola. But I want to do something a\\nlittle bit more interesting. I want to find the places. So if we imagine our axes. This is my x-axis. That's my y-axis. And this is our curve. So the parabola might\\nlook something like this. I want to first figure out where\\ndoes this parabola intersect the x-axis. And as we have already\\nseen, intersecting the x-axis is the same thing\\nas saying when it does this when does y equal\\n0 for this problem? Or another way of\\nsaying it, when does this 5x squared\\nminus 20x plus 15, when does this equal 0? So I want to figure\\nout those points. And then I also want to\\nfigure out the point exactly in between, which is the vertex. And if I can graph\\nthose three points then I should be all set with\\ngraphing this parabola. So as I just said,\\nwe're going to try to solve the equation 5x\\nsquared minus 20x plus 15 is equal to 0. Now the first thing\\nI like to do whenever I see a coefficient out here on\\nthe x squared term that's not a 1, is to see if I can\\ndivide everything by that term to try to simplify\\nthis a little bit. And maybe this will get us\\ninto a factor-able form. And it does look like every\\nterm here is divisible by 5. So I will divide by 5. So I'll divide both sides\\nof this equation by 5. And so that will give\\nme-- these cancel out and I'm left with x squared\\nminus 20 over 5 is 4x. Plus 15 over 5 is 3 is\\nequal to 0 over 5 is just 0. And now we can attempt to\\nfactor this left-hand side. We say are there two numbers\\nwhose product is positive 3? The fact that their\\nproduct is positive tells you they both\\nmust be positive. And whose sum is negative\\n4, which tells you well they both must be negative. If we're getting a\\nnegative sum here. And the one that\\nprobably jumps out of your mind--\\nand you might want to review the videos\\non factoring quadratics if this is not so fresh-- is\\na negative 3 and negative 1 seem to work. Negative 3 times negative 1. Negative 3 times\\nnegative 1 is 3. Negative 3 plus negative\\n1 is negative 4. So this will factor out as\\nx minus 3 times x minus 1. And on the right-hand\\nside, we still have that being equal to 0. And now we can think about what\\nx's will make this expression 0, and if they make\\nthis expression 0, well they're going to\\nmake this expression 0. Which is going to make\\nthis expression equal to 0. And so this will be true if\\neither one of these is 0. So x minus 3 is equal to 0. Or x minus 1 is equal to 0. This is true, and you can\\nadd 3 to both sides of this. This is true when\\nx is equal to 3. This is true when\\nx is equal to 1. So we were able to figure\\nout these two points right over here. This is x is equal to 1. This is x is equal to 3. So this is the point 1 comma 0. This is the point 3 comma 0. And so the last one\\nI want to figure out, is this point right\\nover here, the vertex. Now the vertex always\\nsits exactly smack dab between the roots,\\nwhen you do have roots. Sometimes you might not\\nintersect the x-axis. So we already know what its\\nx-coordinate is going to be. It's going to be 2. And now we just have\\nto substitute back in to figure out its y-coordinate. When x equals 2, y is going to\\nbe equal to 5 times 2 squared minus 20 times 2 plus 15,\\nwhich is equal to-- let's see, this is equal to 2 squared is 4. This is 20 minus 40 plus 15. So this is going\\nto be negative 20 plus 15, which is\\nequal to negative 5. So this is the point\\n2 comma negative 5. And so now we can go\\nback to the exercise and actually plot\\nthese three points. 1 comma 0, 2 comma\\nnegative 5, 3 comma 0. So let's do that. So first I'll do the vertex\\nat 2 comma negative 5, which is right there. And now we also know\\none of the times it intersects the\\nx-axis is at 1 comma 0. And the other time\\nis at 3 comma 0. And now we can check our answer. And we got it right. \"),\n",

       "  \"A ball is shot into the air\\nfrom the edge of a building, 50 feet above the ground. Its initial velocity\\nis 20 feet per second. The equation h--\\nand I'm guessing h is for height-- is equal to\\nnegative 16t squared plus 20t plus 50 can be used to\\nmodel the height of the ball after t seconds. And I think in this\\nproblem they just want us to accept this\\nformula, although we do derive formulas\\nlike this and show why it works for this type of\\nproblem in the Khan Academy physics playlist. But for here, we'll just go\\nwith the flow on this example. So they give us\\nthe equation that can be used to model the height\\nof the ball after t seconds, and then say about\\nhow long does it take for the ball\\nto hit the ground. So if this is the\\nheight, the ground is when the height\\nis equal to 0. So hitting the ground\\nmeans-- this literally means that h is equal to 0. So we need to figure out at\\nwhich times does h equal 0. So we're really\\nsolving the equation 0 is equal to negative 16t\\nsquared plus 20t plus 50. And if you want to simplify\\nthis a little bit-- let's see, everything here is\\ndivisible at least by 2. And let's divide\\neverything by negative 2, just so that we can get rid\\nof this negative leading coefficient. So you divide the left\\nhand side by negative 2, you still get a 0. Negative 16 divided\\nby negative 2 is 8. So 8t squared. 20 divided by negative\\n2 is negative 10. Minus 10t. 50 divided by negative\\n2 is minus 25. And so we have 8t squared minus\\n10t minus 25 is equal to 0. Or if you're comfortable with\\nthis on the left hand side, we can put on the\\nleft hand side. We could just say\\nthis is equal to 0. And now we solve. And we could complete\\nthis square here, or we can just apply the\\nquadratic formula, which is derived from\\ncompleting the square. And we have this\\nin standard form. We know that this is our a. This right over here is our b. And this over here is our c. And the quadratic formula\\ntells us that the roots-- and in this case, it's in\\nterms of the variable t-- are going to be\\nequal to negative b plus or minus the\\nsquare root of b squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. So if we apply it, we get\\nt is equal to negative b. b is negative 10. So negative negative 10 is\\ngoing to be positive 10. Plus or minus the square\\nroot of negative 10 squared. Well, that's just positive\\n100, minus 4 times a, which is 8, times c,\\nwhich is negative 25. And all of that over 2a. a Is 8. So 2 times 8 is 16. And this over here,\\nwe have a-- let's see if we can simplify\\nthis a little bit. The negative sign,\\nnegative times a negative, these are going to be positive. 4 times 25 is 100,\\ntimes 8 is 800. So all that simplifies to 800. And we have 100 plus 800\\nunder the radical sign. So this is equal\\nto 10 plus or minus the square root of 900,\\nall of that over 16. And this is equal to 10 plus\\nor minus-- square root of 900 is 30-- over 16. And so we get time is equal\\nto 10 plus 30 over 16, is 40 over 16, which is\\nthe same thing if we divide the numerator and denominator\\nby 4 to simplify it as 10 over-- or actually even better, divide\\nit by 8-- that's 5 over 2. So that's one solution,\\nif we add the 30. If we subtract the 30,\\nwe'd get 10 minus 30. Or t is equal to 10 minus 30,\\nwhich is negative 20 over 16. Divide the numerator and\\nthe denominator by 4, you get negative 5 over 4. Now, we have to remember,\\nwe're trying to find a time. And so a time, at\\nleast in this problem that we're dealing\\nwith, we should only think about positive times. We want to figure out\\nhow much time has taken-- how long does it take for\\nthe ball to hit the ground? We don't want to\\ngo back in time. So we don't want our\\nnegative answer right here. So we only want to think\\nabout our positive answer. And so this tells us that the\\nonly root that should work is 5/2. And we assume that\\nthis is in seconds. So this is in 5/2 seconds. I wouldn't worry too much\\nabout the physics here. I think they really just want us\\nto apply the quadratic formula to this modeling situation. The physics, we go\\ninto a lot more depth and give you the conceptual\\nunderstanding on our physics playlist. But let's verify that we\\ndefinitely are at a height of 0 at 5/2 seconds, or\\nt is equal to 5/2. This expression right over here\\ndoes give us h is equal to 0. So we have-- let's try it out. We have negative 16\\ntimes 5/2 squared plus 20 times 5/2 plus 50. This needs to be equal to 0. So this is negative\\n16 times 25/4 plus-- let's see, if we divide\\n20 by 2, we get 10. If we divide 2 by 2, we get 1. So 10 times 5 is going to be 50. Plus 50. This needs to be equal to 0. Negative 16 divided\\nby 4 is negative 4. 4 divided by 4 is 1. So you have negative 4\\ntimes 25, which is 100. Plus 50-- oh, sorry. Negative 4 times\\n25 is negative 100. Plus 50, plus 50\\nagain is equal to 0. And so we have negative\\n100 plus another 100. Well, that's definitely\\ngoing to be equal to 0. We get 0 equals 0. And it all checks out. We hit the ground\\nafter 5/2 seconds. Or another way to think\\nabout it is 2.5 seconds. t is equal to 5/2\\nseconds, or 2.5 seconds. \"),\n",

       "  \"I have a function here defined\\nas x squared minus 5x plus 6. And what I want\\nus to think about is what other forms we can\\nwrite this function in if we, say, wanted to find the\\n0s of this function. If we wanted to figure out where\\ndoes this function intersect the x-axis, what form\\nwould we put this in? And then another form\\nfor maybe finding out what's the minimum\\nvalue of this. We see that we have a positive\\ncoefficient on the x squared term. This is going to be an\\nupward-opening parabola. But what's the\\nminimum point of this? Or even better, what's the\\nvertex of this parabola right over here? So if the function looks\\nsomething like this, we could use one\\nform of the function to figure out where does\\nit intersect the x-axis. So where does it\\nintersect the x-axis? And maybe we can manipulate\\nit to get another form to figure out what's\\nthe minimum point. What's this point right\\nover here for this function? I don't even know if the\\nfunction looks like this. So I encourage you\\nto pause this video and try to manipulate this\\ninto those two different forms. So let's work on it. So in order to find the\\nroots, the easiest thing I can think of doing\\nis trying to factor this quadratic\\nexpression which is being used to define\\nthis function. So we could think\\nabout, well, let's think of two numbers whose\\nproduct is positive 6 and whose sum is negative 5. So since their\\nproduct is positive, we know that they\\nhave the same sign. And if they have the same sign\\nbut we get to a negative value, that means they both\\nmust be negative. So let's see-- negative 2\\ntimes negative 3 is positive 6. Negative 2 plus negative\\n3 is negative 5. So we could rewrite f of x. And so let me write it this way. We could write f of\\nx as being equal to x minus 2 times x minus 3. Now, how does this help\\nus find the zeroes? Well, in what situations is\\nthis right-hand expression, is this expression on the right\\nhand going to be equal to 0? Well, it's the product\\nof these two expressions. If either one of these is equal\\nto 0, 0 times anything is 0. 0 times anything else is 0. So this whole thing is going to\\nbe 0 if x minus 2 is equal to 0 or x minus 3 is equal to 0. Add 2 to both sides\\nof this equation. You get x is equal to\\n2 or x is equal to 3. So those are the two\\nzeroes for this function, I guess you could say. And we could already\\nthink about it a little bit in\\nterms of graphing it. So let's try to\\ngraph this thing. So this is x equals 1. This is x equals 2. This is x equals 3\\nright over there. So that's our x-axis. That, you could say, is our\\ny is equal to f of x axis. And we're seeing that we\\nintersect both here and here. When x is equal to 2,\\nthis f of x is equal to 0. When x is equal to 3,\\nf of x is equal to 0. And you could substitute\\neither of these values into the original expression. And you'll see it's\\ngoing to get you to 0 because that is\\nthe same thing as that. Now, what about the vertex? What form could we write\\nthis original thing in order to pick out the vertex? Well, we're already\\na little familiar with completing the square. And when you complete the\\nsquare with this expression, that seems to be a pretty good\\nway of thinking about what the minimum value\\nof this function is. So let's just do\\nthat right over here. So I'm just going to rewrite it. So we get f of x is equal\\nto x squared minus 5x. And I'm just going to throw\\nthe plus 6 right over here. And I'm giving myself\\nsome real estate because what I need to do, what\\nI want to think about doing, is adding and subtracting\\nthe same value. So I'm going to add it here, and\\nI'm going to subtract it there. And I can do that because\\nthen I've just added 0. I haven't changed the value\\nof this right-hand side. But I want to do that so that\\nthis part that I've underlined in this magenta color, so that\\nthis part right over here, is a perfect square. And we've done\\nthis multiple times when we've completed the square. I encourage you to\\nwatch those videos if you need a little\\nbit of a review on it. But the general idea\\nis this is going to be a perfect\\nsquare if we take this coefficient\\nright over here. We take negative 5. We take 1/2 of that, which is\\nnegative 5/2, and we square it. So we could write this\\nas plus negative-- what's negative 5/2 squared? So I could write this--\\nnegative 5/2 squared. Well, if we square\\na negative number, it's just going\\nto be a positive. So it's going to be the\\nsame thing as 5/2 squared. 5 squared is 25. 2 squared is 4. So this is going\\nto be plus 25/4. Now, once again, if we want\\nthis equality to be true, we either have to add the\\nsame thing to both sides. Or if we're just\\noperating on one side, if we added it to that\\nside, we could just subtract it from that side. And we haven't changed the\\ntotal value on that side. So we added 25/4, and\\nwe subtracted 25/4. So what is this part\\nright over here? What does this become,\\nthe part that I've underlined in magenta? Well, this is going to\\nbe-- the whole reason why we engineered it in\\nthis way is so that this could be x minus 5/2 squared. And I encourage\\nyou to verify this. And we go into more\\ndetail about why taking 1/2 the coefficient here\\nand then squaring it, adding it there and then subtracting\\nthere, why that works. We do that in the completing\\nthe square videos. But these two things,\\nyou can verify that they are equivalent. So that's that part. And now we just have to\\nsimplify 6 minus 25/4. So 6 could be rewritten as 24/4. 24/4 minus 25/4 is negative 1/4,\\nso minus 1/4, just like that. So we've rewritten\\nour original function as f of x is equal to x\\nminus 5/2 squared minus 1/4. Now, why is this\\nform interesting? Well, one way to think\\nabout it is this part is always going to\\nbe non-negative. The minimum value of this part\\nin magenta is going to be 0. Why? Because we're\\nsquaring this thing. If you're taking\\nsomething like this-- and we're just dealing\\nwith real numbers-- and you're squaring\\nit, you're not going to be able to\\nget a negative value. At the minimum value,\\nthis is going to be 0. And then it obviously could\\nbe positive values, as well. So if we want to think about\\nwhen does this thing hit its minimum value-- well,\\nit hits its minimum value when you're squaring 0. And when are you squaring 0? Well, you're squaring 0 when\\nx minus 5/2 is equal to 0, or when x is equal\\nto 5/2 if you just want to add 5/2 to both\\nsides of that equation. So this thing hits its minimum\\nvalue when x is equal to 5/2. And then what is y, or what is\\nf of x, when x is equal to 5/2? f of 5/2-- and once again, you\\ncould use any of those forms to evaluate 5/2. But it's really\\neasy in this form. When x is equal to 5/2, this\\nterm right over here becomes 0. 0 squared, 0. You're just left\\nwith negative 1/4. So another way to think\\nabout it is our vertex is at the point x equals\\n5/2, y equals negative 1/4. So x equals 5/2. That's the same\\nthing as 2 and 1/2. So x equals 5/2. And y is equal to negative 1/4. So if that is negative 1, 1/4\\nwould be something like that. So that right over\\nthere is the vertex. That is the point--\\nlet me make it clear-- that's the point 5/2\\ncomma negative 1/4. And what's cool is we've\\njust used this form to figure out the minimum\\npoint, to figure out the vertex in this case. And then we can use the\\nroots as two other points to get a rough sketch of what\\nthis parabola will actually look like. So the interesting-- or I guess\\nthe takeaway from this video is just to realize that we can\\nrewrite this in different forms depending on what we're\\ntrying to understand about this function. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Instructor] The function m is given in three equivalent forms. Which form most quickly\\nreveals the y-intercept? So let\\'s just remind ourselves. If I have a function, the graph y is equal to m of x. And these are all equivalent\\nforms, they tell us that. The function m is given\\nin three equivalent forms. I should be able to\\nalgebraically manipulate anyone of these to get\\nany of the other ones. And so, if I wanted to\\ngraph y is equal to m of x, and let\\'s say it looks\\nsomething like this. I actually know it\\'s a\\ndownward opening parabola, because I can look at\\nthis form right over here and say, \"Hey look, the coefficient \"on the second degree\\nterm here is a negative.\" So it\\'s going to be a\\ndownward opening parabola. That\\'s a messy drawing of it. And so if we\\'re talking\\nabout the y intercept, we\\'re saying, \"Hey where does\\nit intersect the y-axis?\" So what is the y value\\nwhen x is equal to zero? So it boils down to how quickly can we evaluate m of zero? What is m of x, when x is equal to zero? So how quickly can you evaluate m of zero? Well in this top one, I\\ncan substitute zero for x and so it\\'ll be negative two times negative three times negative nine. So it\\'s not too hard to figure out, but there\\'s going to be\\nsome calculation in my head. Similarly in the second choice, for x equals zero, I then\\nget negative six-squared, which is positive 36 times negative two, which is negative 72, and then I have to add\\nthat to positive 18. I can do that, but it\\'s a little bit of computation. But here for this last one, and this is known as standard form, if I say x equals zero\\nthat term disappears, that term disappears and\\nI\\'m just left with m of zero is equal to negative 54. So standard form, this is\\nstandard form right over here, was by far the easiest. So we know the y-intercept\\nis zero comma negative 54. Now one rule of caution. Sometimes you might look at\\nwhat is called, vertex form. And as we\\'ll see this is the easiest one where it is to identify the vertex. But when you see this\\nlittle plus 18 hanging out, it looks a lot like this negative 54 that was hanging out. And you say, \"Hey, when x equals zero, \"maybe I can just cross that out \"the same way that I\\ncross these terms out.\" And be very, very careful there, because if x equals zero, this whole thing does not equal zero. When x is equal to zero, as I just said, you have negative six-squared, which is 36 times negative two. This is equal to negative 72. So m of zero is definitely not 18. So be very, very careful. But we can see that the best choice is this one, standard form, not vertex form or factored form. Factored form, as you can imagine, is very good for figuring out the zeros. Let\\'s do another example. And actually this is the same m of x, but we\\'re going to ask something else. So it\\'s given in those same three forms. Which form most quickly\\nreveals the vertex? Well I just called this\\nvertex form before, but what\\'s valuable about the vertex form is you can really say, \"Okay, this is going to be, \"this is going to achieve its vertex \"when this thing over\\nhere is equal to zero.\" How do I know that? Well, once you get used to vertex form, it\\'ll just become a bit of second nature. But if this is a\\ndownward-opening parabola, the vertex is when you\\nhit that maximum point. And as you can see here, x minus six-squared is always\\ngoing to be non-negative. You multiply that times the negative two, it\\'s always going to be non-positive. It\\'s either going to be\\nzero or a negative value, so this is always going\\nto take away from this 18. And so if you want to find the vertex, the maximum point here, it would be the x value that\\nmakes this thing equal to zero. Because for any other x value, this thing is going to be negative, it\\'s going to take away from that 18. And so you can see by inspection, well what x value will\\nmake this equal to zero? Well if x is equal to six, six minus six is equal to zero, zero-squared is zero, times negative two is zero. And so m of six is equal to 18. So this lets us know very quickly that the vertex is going to\\nhappen at x is equal to six and then the y value there or the m of six is going to be equal to 18. You can do it with these other ones. The hardest one would be standard form. Standard form you could\\ncomplete the square or do some other techniques or you could try to\\nget into factored form. Factored form you can find the zeros and then you\\'d know that the\\nx-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinate\\nof our two x-intercepts and then you could figure\\nout the y value there. But this one is definitely the easiest. The vertex form and what is the vertex? Well it\\'s going to happen\\nat the point six comma 18. Let\\'s do one last example. So this is a different function. The function f is given\\nin three equivalent forms, which form most quickly reveals the zeros or roots of the function? So once again, when we\\'re talking about zeros or roots, if we have, let\\'s say that\\'s the x axis and if you have a parabola\\nthat looks like that, the roots are, or the\\nzeros are the x values that make that function equal to zero. Or they\\'re the x values\\nof the x-intercepts, you could say. And so what x values make or which one is easy to figure out when this function is equal to zero? Which of these forms, because\\nthey\\'re all equivalent. You can expand out these first two and you should get this\\nlast one in standard form. Which one is easy to identify the zeros? Well in factored form, I could just say, \"Well, what makes either this thing zero \"or that thing zero?\" Because an x that makes\\nthis first one zero or the second one zero is going to make this\\nwhole expression zero. So you can quickly say, \"Well if x is equal to negative one, \"this is going to be zero. \"Or if x is equal to negative 11, \"this is going to be zero.\" So this is a very fast\\nway to find out the zeros. This one here, a lot harder. You would have to solve three\\ntimes x plus six-squared minus 75 is equal to zero. Do some algebraic manipulation and you would eventually\\nget to these answers. So I would rule the vertex\\nform right over here. And this form, standard form, the first step I would do, is try to get it into factored form. And then from factored form,\\nI would find the zeros. So once again, this is\\ndefinitely more work than if you already have\\nit in factored form. So factored form is\\ndefinitely what you want when you\\'re trying to find the zeros. And here it says write one of the zeros, I could write x equals negative one or I could have written\\nx equals negative 11. '),\n",

       "  \"We need to find the vertex\\nand the axis of symmetry of this graph. The whole point of doing this\\nproblem is so that you understand what the vertex\\nand axis of symmetry is. And just as a bit of a\\nrefresher, if a parabola looks like this, the vertex is the\\nlowest point here, so this minimum point here, for an\\nupward opening parabola. If the parabola opens downward\\nlike this, the vertex is the topmost point right like that. It's the maximum point. And the axis of symmetry is\\nthe line that you could reflect the parabola around,\\nand it's symmetric. So that's the axis\\nof symmetry. That is a reflection of the\\nleft-hand side along that axis of symmetry. Same thing if it's a\\ndownward-opening parabola. And the general way of telling\\nthe difference between an upward-opening and a\\ndownward-opening parabola is that this will have a positive\\ncoefficient on the x squared term, and this will have\\na negative coefficient. And we'll see that in a little\\nbit more detail. So let's just work on this. Now, in order to figure out the\\nvertex, there's a quick and dirty formula, but I'm not\\ngoing to do the formula here because the formula really tells\\nyou nothing about how you got it. But I'll show you how to apply\\nthe formula at the end of this video, if you see this on a math\\ntest and just want to do it really quickly. But we're going to do it the\\nslow, intuitive way first. So let's think about how we can\\nfind either the maximum or the minimum point of\\nthis parabola. So the best way I can think\\nof doing it is to complete the square. And it might seem like a very\\nforeign concept right now, but let's just do it one\\nstep at a time. So I can rewrite this as y is\\nequal to-- well, I can factor out a negative 2. It's equal to negative 2 times\\nx squared minus 4x minus 4. And I'm going to put the\\nminus 4 out here. And this is where I'm going\\nto complete the square. Now, what I want to do is\\nexpress the stuff in the parentheses as a sum of a\\nperfect square and then some number over here. And I have x squared minus 4x. If I wanted this to be a perfect\\nsquare, it would be a perfect square if I had a\\npositive 4 over here. If I had a positive 4 over\\nthere, then this would be a perfect square. It would be x minus 2 squared. And I got the 4, because I said,\\nwell, I want whatever half of this number is,\\nso half of negative 4 is negative 2. Let me square it. That'll give me a positive\\n4 right there. But I can't just add\\na 4 willy-nilly to one side of an equation. I either have to add it to the\\nother side or I would have to then just subtract it. So here I haven't changed\\nequation. I added 4 and then\\nI subtracted 4. I just added zero to this little\\nexpression here, so it didn't change it. But what it does allow me to do\\nis express this part right here as a perfect square. x\\nsquared minus 4x plus 4 is x minus 2 squared. It is x minus 2 squared. And then you have this\\nnegative 2 out front multiplying everything, and\\nthen you have a negative 4 minus negative 4, minus\\n8, just like that. So you have y is equal to\\nnegative 2 times this entire thing, and now we can multiply\\nout the negative 2 again. So we can distribute it. Y is equal to negative 2 times\\nx minus 2 squared. And then negative 2 times\\nnegative 8 is plus 16. Now, all I did is algebraically arrange this equation. But what this allows us to do\\nis think about what the maximum or minimum point\\nof this equation is. So let's just explore\\nthis a little bit. This quantity right here, x\\nminus 2 squared, if you're squaring anything, this\\nis always going to be a positive quantity. That right there is\\nalways positive. But it's being multiplied\\nby a negative number. So if you look at the larger\\ncontext, if you look at the always positive multiplied by\\nthe negative 2, that's going to be always negative. And the more positive that this\\nnumber becomes when you multiply it by a negative, the\\nmore negative this entire expression becomes. So if you think about it,\\nthis is going to be a downward-opening parabola. We have a negative coefficient\\nout here. And the maximum point on this\\ndownward-opening parabola is when this expression right here\\nis as small as possible. If this gets any larger, it's\\njust multiplied by a negative number, and then you subtract\\nit from 16. So if this expression right here\\nis 0, then we have our maximum y value, which is 16. So how do we get x is\\nequal to 0 here? Well, the way to get x minus\\n2 equal to 0-- so let's just do it. x minus 2 is equal to 0,\\nso that happens when x is equal to 2. So when x is equal to 2,\\nthis expression is 0. 0 times a negative number,\\nit's all 0, and then y is equal to 16. This is our vertex, this\\nis our maximum point. We just reasoned through it,\\njust looking at the algebra, that the highest value this\\ncan take on is 16. As x moves away from 2 in\\nthe positive or negative direction, this quantity right\\nhere, it might be negative or positive, but when you square\\nit, it's going to be positive. And when you multiply it by\\nnegative 2, it's going to become negative and it's going\\nto subtract from 16. So our vertex right here\\nis x is equal to 2. Actually, let's say each\\nof these units are 2. So this is 2, 4, 6,\\n8, 10, 12, 14, 16. So my vertex is here. That is the absolute maximum\\npoint for this parabola. And its axis of symmetry is\\ngoing to be along the line x is equal to 2, along the\\nvertical line x is equal to 2. That is going to be its\\naxis of symmetry. And now if we're just curious\\nfor a couple of other points, just because we want to plot\\nthis thing, we could say, well, what happens when\\nx is equal to 0? That's an easy one. When x is equal to 0,\\ny is equal to 8. So when x is equal to 0, we have\\n1, 2, 3, 4-- oh, well, these are 2. 2, 4, 6, 8. It's right there. This is an axis of symmetry. So when x is equal to 3, y is\\nalso going to be equal to 8. So this parabola is a really\\nsteep and narrow one that looks something like this, where\\nthis right here is the maximum point. Now I told you this is the slow\\nand intuitive way to do the problem. If you wanted a quick and dirty\\nway to figure out a vertex, there is a formula\\nthat you can derive it actually, doing this exact same\\nprocess we just did, but the formula for the vertex, or\\nthe x-value of the vertex, or the axis of symmetry, is x is\\nequal to negative b over 2a. So if we just apply this-- but,\\nyou know, this is just kind of mindless application\\nof a formula. I wanted to show you the\\nintuition why this formula even exists. But if you just mindlessly\\napply this, you'll get-- what's b here? So x is equal to negative--\\nb here is 8. 8 over 2 times a. a right here is a negative 2. 2 times negative 2. So what is that going\\nto be equal to? It is negative 8 over negative\\n4, which is equal to 2, which is the exact same thing we\\ngot by reasoning it out. And when x is equal to\\n2, y is equal to 16. Same exact result there. That's the point 2 comma 16. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Voiceover] So, I have three\\ndifferent functions here. I know they're all called f, but we're gonna just assume\\nthey are different functions. And, for each of these, I\\nwant to do three things. I want to find the zeros. And so, the zeros are the input values that make the value of the\\nfunction equal to zero. So, here it'd be the t values\\nthat make f of t equal zero. Here, it'd be the x values that make the function equal zero. So, I want to find the zeros. I also want to find the\\ncoordinates of the vertex. And finally, I want to find the equation of the line of symmetry. Line of symmetry. And in particular, to make it\\na little bit more specific, the vertical line of symmetry,\\nwhich will actually be the only line of symmetry for these three. So, pause the video and\\nsee if you can figure out the zeros, the vertex,\\nand the line of symmetry. And I'm assuming you just did that and now I am going to attempt to do it. And if, at any point, you get inspired pause the video again and\\nkeep on working on it. The best way to learn this\\nstuff is to do it yourself. So, let's see, so let's\\nfirst find the zeros. So, to find the zeros, we can set t minus five squared,\\nminus nine, equal to zero. So, we could say t ... for what t's does t minus five squared,\\nminus nine, equal zero? Let's see, to solve this, we\\ncould add nine to both sides. And so we could say, if\\nwe add nine to both sides the lefthand side's just\\nt minus five squared. The righthand side is going to be nine. And so, if t minus five squared\\nis nine, that means that t minus five could be equal to the positive square root of nine or t minus five could equal the negative square root of nine. And to solve for t, we could\\nadd five to both sides, so we get t is equal to\\neight or t is equal to, if we add five to both sides here, t is equal to two. And just like that, we\\nhave found the zeros for this function because if\\nt is equal to eight or two, the function is going to be zero. F of eight is zero and f\\nof two is going to be zero. Now, let's find the vertex,\\nthe coordinates of the vertex. The coordinates of the vertex. So, the x coordinate of the vertex, or sorry, I should say the\\nt coordinate of the vertex since the input variable here is t, the t coordinate of the\\nvertex is going to be halfway in between the zeros. It's going to be halfway in between where the parabola, in this case, is going to intersect the x axis, or the t axis, I keep saying x axis, the t axis for this case. So, halfway between eight and two. Well, it's gonna be the average of them. Eight plus two, over two. That's ten over two, that's five. The t coordinate is five and five is three away from eight\\nand three away from two. And, when t is equal to\\nfive, what is f of t? What is f of five? Well, when t is equal to five, five minus five squared is just zero. And then, f of five is just\\ngoing to be negative nine. And this form of a function,\\nthis is actually called vertex form because it's very\\neasy to pick out the vertex. It's very easy to\\nrealize, like, okay look, for this particular one, we're\\ngoing to hit a minimum point when this part of the\\nexpression is equal to zero because this thing, the\\nlowest value it can take on is zero cause you're squaring it, it can never take on a negative value. And it takes on zero\\nwhen t is equal to five. And when that's, if this part is zero, then the f of five is\\ngoing to be negative nine. So, just like that, we have\\nestablished the vertex. Now, we actually have a lot of information if we wanted to draw it. So, if we want to draw this function. I'll just do a very quick sketch of it. Whoops. So, a very quick sketch of it. So, that is our t axis, not our x axis, I have to keep reminding myself. And that is my, let's call that my y axis. And we're going to graph\\ny is equal to f of t. Well, we know the vertex is at the point five comma negative nine. So, this is, t is equal to five and y is equal to negative nine, so that's the vertex right over there. And then, we know we have zeros at t equals eight and t equals two. So, t equals eight and t equals two. Let me make that a little\\nbit in, t equals two. Those are the two zeros. So, eight and two. And so, just like that,\\nwe can graph f of t, or we can graph y is equal to f of t. So, y is equal to f of t is\\ngoing to look something like let me draw it a little\\n... something like that That's the graph of y is equal to f of t. Now, the last thing that I\\nsaid is the line of symmetry. Well, the line of symmetry is going to be the vertical line that\\ngoes through the vertex. So, the equation of that line of symmetry is going to be t is equal to five. That's really just the t\\ncoordinate of the vertex. That defines the line of symmetry. Let's do the other two right over here. So, what are the zeros? Well, if you set this equal\\nto zero, if we say x plus two times x plus four is equal to zero, well that's going to happen\\nif x plus two is equal to zero or x plus four is equal to zero. This is going to happen if we\\nsubtract two from both sides, when x is negative two,\\nand if we subtract four from both sides, or when x\\nis equal to negative four. As we said, the vertex, the\\nx coordinate of the vertex, is going to be halfway in between these. So, it's going to be negative\\ntwo plus negative four, over two, so that would\\nbe negative six, over two, which is just negative three. Negative three. And when x is negative\\nthree, f of x is going to be, let's see, it's going to be negative one times one, right? Negative three plus two is\\nnegative one, and so times one. So, it's just going to be negative one. There you have it. And the line of symmetry is\\ngoing to be the vertical line x is equal to negative three. And once again, we can\\ngraph that really fast. So, let me, this is my y axis. See everything is\\nhappening for negative x's, so I'll draw it a little\\nbit more skewed this way. This is my x axis. And we see that we have zeros\\nat x equals negative two and x is equal to negative four. So, negative one, two, three, four. So, we have zeros there, negative two, be careful. Negative two and negative four. And the vertex is at negative\\nthree comma negaitve one. So, negative three comma negative one. Make sure we see that, so this is negative one right over\\nhere, negative one. This is negative two,\\nthis is negative four. And so we can sketch out what the graph of y is equal to f of x\\nis going to look like. It's gonna look something like that. That is y is equal to f of x. Let's do one more. Hopefully, we're getting the hang of this. So, here, to solve x squared,\\nplus six x, plus eight is equal to zero, it will\\nbe useful to factor this. And so, this can be written as, and if you have trouble doing this,\\nI encourage you to watch videos on factoring polynomials, What adds up to six and when you take their product is eight? Well, four and two. Four plus two is six and\\nfour times two is eight. So, is equal to zero. And then, this is actually\\nthe exact same thing as what we have in blue right over here. These are actually the\\nexact same function. They're just written in different forms. And so, the solutions are\\ngonna be the exact solutions that we just saw right\\nover here and the graph is going to be the same thing\\nthat we have right over there. So, same vertex, same line\\nof symmetry, same zeros. These functions were just\\nwritten in different ways. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're\\ntold that Rodrigo watches a helicopter take off from a platform. The height of the helicopter,\\nin meters above the ground, t minutes after takeoff is modeled by, and we see this function right over here. Rodrigo wants to know when the helicopter will land on the ground. So pause this video and see\\nif you can figure that out. All right, now let's\\nthink about this together. So let's just imagine\\nactually what the graph of this function looks like. And it'll also help us\\nimagine what's going on with the helicopter. So our horizontal axis,\\nthis is t, time in minutes, and then our vertical axis is height. So height as a function of time. And maybe I just write it like this. I'll just write height, and this is given in\\nmeters above the ground. Now I don't know exactly\\nwhat the graph looks like, but given that I have\\na negative coefficient on my quadratic term, I know that it is a downward\\nopening parabola like that. And it says that the helicopter\\ntakes off of a platform. So however high the platform is, then it takes off and it's\\ngoing to do something like this. I don't know exactly what\\nthe graph looks like, but probably something like this. Now, if they asked us\\nwhat is the highest point of the helicopter, and at\\nwhat time does it happen, then we'd wanna figure\\nout what the vertex is of this parabola. But that's not what they're asking. They're asking when does the\\nhelicopter land on the ground? That's this time right over here. So if we wanted to find the vertex, we would wanna put this into vertex form, but here we wanna figure out when does that function equal zero. We want to find a zero of this\\nquadratic right over here. So the best way that I\\ncan think about doing it is try to factor it, try to set them this thing equal to zero, and then factor it and\\nthen see what t values make that equal to zero. So let me do that. So I say negative three t\\nsquared plus 24t plus 60, remember we care when our height is equal to zero, equal zero. So let's see maybe the\\nfirst thing I would do just to simplify the second\\ndegree term a little bit. Let's just divide both\\nsides by negative three. If we did that, this would become t squared\\n24 divided by negative three is negative eight, negative eight t. 60 divided by negative\\nthree is negative 20, and then zero divided by negative three is of course still zero. And now can I think of\\ntwo numbers whose product is negative 20? So they would have different signs in order to get a negative product, and who sum is negative eight. So let's see what about\\nnegative 10 and two, and that scene seems to work. So I could write this as t\\nminus 10, times t plus two is equal to zero. And so in order to make\\nthis expression equals zero, either one of these\\ncould be equal to zero. So either t minus 10 is equal to zero, or t plus two is equal to zero. And of course on the left here, I can add 10 to both sides. So either t equals 10, or I could subtract two\\nfrom both sides here, t is equal to negative two. So there's two places where the function is equal to zero. One at time t equals negative two, and one at time t is equal to 10. Now we're assuming we're\\ndealing with positive time here. We don't know what the\\nhelicopter was doing before the takeoff. So we wouldn't really think about this. So what we really care about is that t is equal to 10 minutes. That's when the helicopter\\nis right over there. And actually we know at t equals zero, these two terms become zero. We know it takes off at 60 meters. It goes up. If we figured out the vertex, we would know how high it went, but then it starts going back down, and in 10 minutes after takeoff, it is back at zero, back on the ground. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] We're told that\\nTaylor opened a restaurant. The net value of the restaurant\\nin thousands of dollars, t months after its opening is modeled by v of t is equal to\\ntwo t squared minus 20t. Taylor wants to know what the restaurant's\\nlowest net value will be, underline that, and when\\nit will reach that value. So let's break it down step by step. The function which describes how the value of the restaurant, the net value of the restaurant, changes over time is right over here. If I were to graph it, I\\ncan see that the coefficient on the quadratic term is positive, so it's going to be some form\\nof upward-opening parabola. I don't know exactly what it looks like, we can think about that in a second. And so it's going to have\\nsome point, right over here, which really is the\\nvertex of this parabola, where it's going to hit\\nits lowest in that value, and that's going to happen at some time t, if you can imagine that this\\nright over here is the t-axis. So my first question\\nis, is there some form, is there some way that I can re-write this function algebraically\\nso it becomes very easy to pick out this low point, which is essentially the\\nvertex of this parabola? Pause this video and think about that. All right, so you can imagine the form that I'm talking about is vertex form, where you can clearly spot the vertex. And the way we can do that is actually by completing the square. So the first thing I will do is, actually let me factor out a two here, because two is a common\\nfactor of both of these terms. So v of t would be equal to\\ntwo times t squared minus 10t. And I'm going to leave some space, because completing the square,\\nwhich gets us to vertex form, is all about adding and subtracting the same value on one side. So we're not actually changing\\nthe value of that side, but writing it in a way so we have a perfect square expression, and then we're probably going to add or subtract some value out here. Now how do we make this a\\nperfect square expression? If any of this business about completing the square\\nlooks unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to look\\nup completing the square on Khan Academy and review that. But the way that we complete the square is we look at this first degree\\ncoefficient right over here, it's negative 10, and we say all right, well let's take half\\nof that and square it. So half of negative 10 is negative five, and if we were to square it, that's 25. So if we add 25 right over here, then this is going to become\\na perfect square expression. And you can see that\\nit would be equivalent to this entire thing,\\nif we add 25 like that, is going to be equivalent\\nto t minus five squared, just this part right over here. That's why we took half\\nof this and we squared it. But as I alluded to a few seconds\\nago, or a few minutes ago, you can't just willy\\nnilly add 25 to one side of an equation like this, that will make this\\nequality no longer true. And in fact we didn't just add 25. Remember we have this two out\\nhere, we added two times 25. You can verify that if\\nyou redistribute the two, you'd get two t squared minus 20t plus 50, plus two times 25. So in order to make the equality, or in order to allow it\\nto continue to be true, we have to subtract 50. So just to be clear, this isn't some kind of\\nstrange thing I'm doing, all I did was add 50 and subtract 50. You're saying wait, you added 25, not 50. No look, when I added 25\\nhere, it's in a parenthesis, and then the whole expression\\nis multiplied by two, so I really did add 50 here,\\nso then I subtract 50 here to get to what I originally had. And when you view it that way, now v of t is going to be equal\\nto two times this business, which we already established\\nis t minus five squared, and then we have the minus 50. Now why is this form useful? This is vertex form, it's very\\neasy to pick out the vertex. It's very easy to pick\\nout when the low point is. The low point here happens\\nwhen this part is minimized. And this part is\\nminimized, think about it, you have two times something squared. So if you have something squared, it's going to hit its lowest point when this something is zero, otherwise it's going\\nto be a positive value. And so this part right over here is going to be equal to zero\\nwhen t is equal to five. So the lowest value is\\nwhen t is equal to five. Let me do that in a different color, don't wanna reuse the colors too much. So if we say v of five is going to be equal to two times five minus five, trying to keep up with the colors, minus five squared minus 50. Notice this whole thing\\nbecomes zero right over here. So v of five is equal to negative 50, that is when we hit our low point, in terms of the net\\nvalue of the restaurant. So t represents months,\\nso we hit our low point, we rewrote our function\\nin a form, in vertex form, so it's easy to pick out this value, and we see that this low point\\nhappens at t equals five, which is at time five months. And then what is that lowest net value? Well it's negative 50. And remember, the function\\ngives us the net value in thousands of dollars,\\nso it's negative $50,000 is the lowest net value of the restaurant. And you might say how do you have a negative value of something, well imagine if, say the\\nbuilding is worth $50,000, but the restaurant owes $100,000, then it would have a\\nnegative $50,000 net value. \"),\n",

       "  '- [Voiceover] So we\\'re\\nasked which function has the greater y-intercept? So, the y-intercept is the y-coordinate when x is equal to zero. So, f of zero, when x is equal to zero, the function is equal to, let\\'s see, f of zero is going to be equal to zero minus zero, plus four,\\nis going to be equal to four. So this function right over here, it has a y-intercept of four. So it would intersect the\\ny-axis right over there. While the function that\\nwe\\'re comparing it to, g of x, we\\'re looking at its graph, y is equal to g of x, its y-intercept is right over here, at y is equal to three. So which function has\\na greater y-intercept? Well, it\\'s going to be f of x. F of x has a greater\\ny-intercept than g of x does. Let\\'s do a few more of these where we\\'re comparing different functions. One of them that has a visual depiction, and one of them where we\\'re\\njust given the equation. How many roots do the\\nfunctions have in common? Well, g of x, we can see their roots. The roots are, x equals negative one and x is equal to two. So these two functions, at most, are going to have two roots in common, because this g of x only has two roots. There\\'s a couple of\\nways we could tackle it. We could just try to find f\\'s roots, or we could plug in\\neither one of these values and see if it makes the\\nfunction equal to a zero. I\\'ll do the first way,\\nI\\'ll try to factor this. So let\\'s see, what two numbers,\\nif I add them I get one, \\'cause that\\'s the coefficient\\nhere, or implicitly there. And if I take the product,\\nI get negative six. Well, their gonna have\\nto have different signs since their product is negative. So, let\\'s see, negative\\nthree and positive two. No, actually, the other way\\naround \\'cause it\\'s positive one. So positive three, and negative two. So this is equal to x plus\\nthree, times x minus two. So f of x is going to have zeros when x is equal to negative three. X is equal to negative three. Or, x is equal to two. These are the two zeros. If x is equal to negative three, this expression becomes zero. Zero times anything is zero. If x equals two, this\\nexpression becomes zero, and zero times anything is zero. So f of negative three is\\nzero, and f of two is zero. These are the zeros of that function. So let\\'s see, which of\\nthese are in common? Well, negative three is out\\nhere, that\\'s not in common. X equals two is in common, so they only have one common\\nzero right over there. So how many roots do the\\nfunctions have in common? One. All right. Let\\'s do one more of these. And they ask us, \"Do the functions\\nhave the same concavity?\" And one way to think about concavity is whether it\\'s opening upwards\\nor opening downwards. So this is often viewed\\nas concave upwards, and this is viewed as concave downwards. Concave downwards. And the key realization is, well, if you just look at this\\nblue, if you look at g of x right over here, it is concave downwards. So the question is, \"Would this be concave \"downwards or upwards?\" And the key here is the coefficient on the second degree term,\\non the x squared term. If the coefficient is positive, you\\'re going to be concave upwards, because as x gets suitably\\nfar away from zero, this term is going to\\noverpower everything else, and it\\'s going to become positive. So as x gets further and further away, we\\'re not even further away from zero, as x gets further and\\nfurther away from the vertex, as x gets further and\\nfurther away from the vertex, this term dominates everything else, and we get more and more positive values. And so that\\'s why if your\\ncoefficient is positive, you\\'re going to have concave upwards, a concave upwards graph. And so if this is concave upwards, this one is clearly concave downwards. They do not have the\\nsame concavity, so no. If this was negative\\nfour x squared minus 108, then it would be concave\\ndownwards and we would say yes. Anyway, hopefully you\\nfound that interesting. '),\n",

       "  \"Which quadratic has the\\nlowest maximum value? So let's figure out the maximum\\nvalue for each of these-- and they're defined\\nin different ways-- and then see which\\none is the lowest. And I'll start with the easiest. So h of x. We can just graphically look\\nat it, visually look at it, and say-- what's\\nthe maximum point? And the maximum point looks\\nlike it's right over here when x is equal to 4. And when x is equal to 4, y or\\nh of x is equal to negative 1. So the maximum for h of x\\nlooks like it is negative 1. Now, what's the\\nmaximum for g of x? And they've given us some\\npoints here and here. Once again, we can just\\neyeball it, and say-- well, what's the maximum\\nvalue they gave us? Well, 5 is the largest value. It happens when x is\\nequal to 0. g of 0 is 5. So the maximum value here is 5. Now, f of x. They just give us an\\nexpression to define it. And so it's going take\\na little bit of work to figure out what\\nthe maximum value is. The easiest way to do\\nthat for a quadratic is to complete the square. And so let's do it. So we have f of x is equal\\nto negative x squared plus 6x minus 1. I never like having\\nthis negative here. So I'm going to factor it out. This is the same thing\\nas negative times x squared minus 6x and plus 1. And I'm going to write\\nthe plus 1 out here because I'm fixing to\\ncomplete the square. Now, just as a review of\\ncompleting the square, we essentially want to add\\nand subtract the same number so that part of this\\nexpression is a perfect square. And to figure out what number\\nwe want to add and subtract, we look at the\\ncoefficient on the x term. It's a negative 6. You take half of that. That's negative 3. And you square it. Negative 3 squared is 9. Now, we can't just add a 9. That would change the actual\\nvalue of the expression. We have to add a 9\\nand subtract a 9. And you might say-- well, why\\nare we adding and subtracting the same thing if\\nit doesn't change the value of the expression? And the whole\\npoint is so that we can get this first\\npart of the expression to represent a perfect square. This x squared minus 6x\\nplus 9 is x minus 3 squared. So I can rewrite that\\npart as x minus 3 squared and then minus 9--\\nor negative 9-- plus 1 is negative 8. Let me do that in\\na different color so we can keep track of things. So this part right over\\nhere is negative 8. And we still have the\\nnegative out front. And so we can rewrite\\nthis as-- if we distribute the negative sign-- negative\\nx minus 3 squared plus 8. Now, let's think about\\nwhat the maximum value is. And to understand\\nthe maximum value, we have to interpret this\\nnegative x minus 3 squared. Well, x minus 3 squared-- before\\nwe think about the negative-- that is always going\\nto be a positive value. Or it's always going\\nto be non-negative. But then, when we\\nmake it negative, it's always going\\nto be non-positive. Think about it. If x is equal to 3, this\\nthing is going to be 0. And you take the negative\\nof that, it's going to be 0. x is anything else,\\nx is anything other than 3, this part\\nof the expression is going to be positive. But then, you have a minus sign. So you're going to subtract\\nthat positive value from 8. So this actually\\nhas a maximum value when this first term\\nright over here is 0. The only thing that this part\\nof the expression could do is subtract from the 8. If you want to get\\na maximum value, this should be equal to 0. This equals 0 when\\nx is equal to 3. When x is equal to 3, this is 0. And our function hits\\nits maximum value of 8. So this has a max-- let\\nme do that in a color that you can actually read--\\nthis has a max value of 8. So which has the\\nlowest maximum value? h of x. \"),\n",

       "  \"Here I've drawn the\\nmost classic parabola, y is equal to x squared. And what I want to do is think\\nabout what happens-- or how can I go about shifting\\nthis parabola. And so let's think about\\na couple of examples. So let's think about\\nthe graph of the curve. This is y is equal to x squared. Let's think about what\\nthe curve of y minus k is equal to x squared. What would this look like? Well, right over here, we\\nsee when x is equal to 0, x squared is equal to 0. That's this yellow curve. So x squared is equal to y,\\nor y is equal to x squared. But for this one, x\\nsquared isn't equal to y. It's equal to y minus k. So when x equals a\\n0, and we square it, 0 squared doesn't get us to y. It gets us to y minus k. So this is going to\\nbe k less than y. Or another way of thinking\\nabout it, this is 0. If it's k less than y, y must\\nbe at k, wherever k might be. So y must be at k,\\nright over there. So at least for this\\npoint, it had the effect of shifting up the y value by k. And that's actually true\\nfor any of these values. So let's think about x\\nbeing right over here. For this yellow curve,\\nyou square this x value, and you get it there. And it's clearly not\\ndrawn to scale the way that I've done it\\nright over here. But now for this\\ncurve right over here, x squared doesn't cut it. It only gets you to y minus k. So y must be k higher than this. So this is y minus k. y\\nmust be k higher than this. So y must be right over here. So this curve is essentially\\nthis blue curve shifted up by k. So making it y minus k is equal\\nto x squared shifted it up by k. Whatever value this\\nis, shift it up by k. This distance is a constant\\nk, the vertical distance between these two parabolas. And I'll try to draw\\nit as cleanly as I can. This vertical distance\\nis a constant k. Now let's think about shifting\\nin the horizontal direction. Let's think about what happens\\nif I were to say y is equal to, not x squared, but\\nx minus h squared. So let's think about it. This is the value you would get\\nfor y when you just square 0. You get y is equal to 0. How do we get y\\nequals 0 over here? Well, this quantity right\\nover here has to be 0. So x minus h has to be 0,\\nor x has to be equal to h. So let's say that h\\nis right over here. So x has to be equal to h. So one way to think about\\nit is, whatever value you were squaring here\\nto get your y, you now have to have\\nan h higher value to square that same thing. Because you're going\\nto subtract h from it. Just to get to 0,\\nx has to equal h. Here, if you wanted to square\\n1, x just had to be equal to 1. So here, let's just say,\\nfor the sake of argument, that this is x is equal to 1. And this is 1 squared,\\nclearly not drawn to scale. So that would be 1, as well. But now to square 1, we don't\\nhave to just get x equals 1. x has to be h plus 1. It has to be 1 higher than h. It has to be h plus 1 to\\nget to that same point. So you see the net\\neffect is that instead of squaring just x,\\nbut squaring x minus h, we shifted the\\ncurve to the right. So the curve-- let me do this in\\nthis purple color, this magenta color-- will look like this. We shifted it to the right. And we shifted it\\nto the right by h. Now let's think of another\\nthought experiment. Let's imagine that-- let's\\nthink about the curve y is equal to\\nnegative x squared. Well, now whatever the\\nvalue of x squared is, we're going to take\\nthe negative of it. So here, no matter what\\nx we took, we squared it. We get a positive value. Now we're always going\\nto get a negative value once we multiply it\\ntimes a negative 1. So it's going to look like this. It's going to be a\\nmirror image of y equals x squared reflected\\nover the horizontal axis. So it's going to look\\nsomething like that. So that's y is equal\\nto negative x squared. And now let's just imagine\\nscaling it even more. What would y equal\\nnegative 2x squared? Well, actually, let\\nme do two things. So what would y equals\\n2x squared look like? So let's just take\\nthe positive version, so y equals 2x squared. Well, now as we\\nsquare things, we're going to multiply them by 2. So it's going to\\nincrease faster. So it's going to look\\nsomething like this. It's going to be\\nnarrower and steeper. So it might look\\nsomething like this. And once again, I'm just\\ngiving you the idea. I haven't really\\ndrawn this to scale. So increasing it by a factor\\nwill make it increase faster. If we did y equals\\nnegative 2x squared, well, then it's going to get\\nnegative faster on either side. So it's going to look\\nsomething like this. It's going to be the mirror\\nimage of what I just drew. So it's going to be a narrower\\nparabola just like that. And similarly-- and I know that\\nmy diagram is getting really messy right now--\\nbut just remember we started with y\\nequals x squared, which is this curve\\nright over here. What happens if we did\\ny equals 1/2 x squared? I'm running out of\\ncolors, as well. If we did y equals\\n1/2 x squared, well, then the thing's\\ngoing to increase slower. It's going to look the same,\\nbut it's going to open up wider. It's going to increase slower. It's going to look\\nsomething like this. So this hopefully\\ngives you a sense of how we can shift\\nparabolas around. So for example, if I have-- and\\nI'm doing a very rough drawing here to give you the\\ngeneral idea of what we're talking about. So if this is y\\nequals x squared, so that's the graph\\nof y equals x squared. Let me do this in a color\\nthat I haven't used yet-- the graph of y minus k is equal\\nto A times x minus h squared will look something like this. Instead of the vertex\\nbeing at 0, 0, the vertex-- or the lowest, or\\nI guess you could say the minimum or\\nthe maximum point, the extreme point in the\\nparabola, this point right over here, would be the maximum\\npoint for a downward opening parabola, a minimum point for\\nan upward opening parabola-- that's going to be shifted. It's going to be shifted\\nby h to the right and k up. So its vertex is going\\nto be right over here. And it's going to be scaled\\nby A. So if A is equal to 1, it's going to look the same. It's going to have\\nthe same opening. So that's A equals 1. If A is greater than 1, it's\\ngoing to be steeper, like this. If A is less than 1\\nbut greater than 0, it's just going to be\\nwider opening, like that. Actually, if A is 0, then it\\njust turns into a flat line. And then if A is negative\\nbut less than negative 1, it's kind of a broad-opening\\nthing like that. Or I should say greater\\nthan negative 1. If it's between\\n0 and negative 1, it will be a broad-opening\\nthing like that. At negative 1, it'll\\nlook like a reflection of our original curve. And then if A is less\\nthan negative 1-- so it's even more\\nnegative-- then it's going to be even a\\nsteeper parabola that might look like that. So hopefully that\\ngives you a good way of how to shift and\\nscale parabolas. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Function g can\\nbe thought of as a translated or shifted version of f of\\nx is equal to x squared. Write the equation for g of x. Now, pause this video, and see if you can work\\nthis out on your own. All right, so whenever I think\\nabout shifting a function, and in this case, we're\\nshifting a parabola, I like to look for a distinctive point. And on a parabola, the vertex is going to be our most distinctive point. And if I focus on the vertex of f, it looks like if I shift that to the right by three, and then if I were to shift that down by four, at least our vertices would overlap. I would be able to shift the vertex to where the vertex of g is. And it does look, and we'll validate this, at\\nleast visually, in a little bit, so I'm gonna go minus four\\nin the vertical direction, that not only would it\\nmake the vertices overlap, but it would make the\\nentire curve overlap. So we're going to make,\\nwe're gonna first shift to the right by three. And we're gonna think about how\\nwould we change our equation so it shifts f to the right by three, and then we're gonna shift down by four. Shift down by four. Now, some of you might\\nalready be familiar with this, and I go into the intuition in a lot more depth in other videos. But in general, when you shift to the right by some value, in this case, we're shifting\\nto the right by three, you would replace x with x minus three. So one way to think about this\\nwould be y is equal to f of x minus three, or y is equal to, instead\\nof it being x squared, you would replace x with x minus three. So it'd be x minus three squared. Now, when I first learned this,\\nthis was counterintuitive. I'm shifting to the right by three. The x-coordinate of my vertex\\nis increasing by three, but I'm replacing x with x minus three. Why does this make sense? Well, let's graph the shifted version, just to get a little\\nbit more intuition here. Once again, I go into much more\\ndepth in other videos here. This is more of a worked example. So this is what the shifted\\ncurve is gonna look like. Think about the behavior that we want, right over here, at x equals three. We want the same value\\nthat we used to have when x equals zero. When x equals zero for the original f, zero squared was zero. Y equals zero. We still want y equals zero. Well, the way that we can do that is if we are squaring zero, and the way that we're gonna square zero is if we subtract three from x. And you can validate that at other points. Think about what happens\\nnow, when x equals four. Four minus three is one squared. It does indeed equal one. The same behavior that you used to get at x is equal to one. So it does look like we have\\nindeed shifted to the right by three when we replace\\nx with x minus three. If you replaced x with x plus three, it would have had the opposite effect. You would have shifted\\nto the left by three, and I encourage to think about why that actually makes sense. So now that we've shifted\\nto the right by three, the next step is to shift down by four, and this one is little bit more intuitive. So let's start with our\\nshifted to the right. So that's y is equal to\\nx minus three squared. But now, whatever y value we were getting, we want to get four less than that. So when x equals three, instead\\nof getting y equals zero, we want to get y equals\\nfour less, or negative four. When x equals four,\\ninstead of getting one, we want to get y is\\nequal to negative three. So whatever y value we were getting, we want to now get four less than that. So the shifting in the vertical direction is a little bit more intuitive. If we shift down, we subtract that amount. If we shift up, we add that amount. So this, right over here,\\nis the equation for g of x. G of x is going to be equal\\nto x minus three squared minus four. And once again, just to review, replacing the x with x\\nminus three, on f of x, that's what shifted, shifted right by three, by three. And then, subtracting the four, that shifted us down by four, shifted down by four, to give us this next graph. And you can visualize, or\\nyou can verify visually, that if you shift each of these\\npoints exactly down by four, we are, we are indeed going to overlap on top of g of x. \"),\n",

       "  \"- [Instructor] Function\\nG can be thought of as a scaled version of F\\nof X is equal to X squared. Write the equation for G of X. So like always, pause this video and see if you can do it on your own. Alright now, let's work\\nthrough this together. So the first thing that\\nwe might appreciate is that G seems not only to\\nbe flipped over the x-axis, but then flipped over\\nand then stretched wider. So let's do these in steps. So first let's flip over, flip over the x-axis. So if we were to do this\\nvisually it would look like this. Instead when X is equal to zero, Y is still gonna be equal to zero. But when X is equal to negative one, instead of Y being equal to one, it'd now be equal to negative one. When X is equal to one,\\ninstead of squaring one and getting one, you then\\ntake the negative of that to get to negative one. So when you flip it, it looks like this. Y when is X is equal to negative two instead of Y being equal to four, it would now be equal to negative four. So it would look like this. So as we just talk through\\nas we're trying to draw this flipped over version, whatever Y value we were\\ngetting before for a given X, we would now get the opposite\\nof it, or the negative of it. So this green function right over here is going to be Y is equal\\nto the negative of F of X, or we could say Y is equal\\nto negative X squared. Whatever the X is, you square it, and then you take the negative of it. Whatever X is, you square it, and then you take the negative of it, and you see that that will\\nflip it over the x-axis. But that by itself does\\nnot get us to G of X. G of X also seems to be stretched in the horizontal direction. And so let's think about,\\ncan we multiply this times some scaling factor so\\nthat it does that stretching so that we can match up to G of X? And the best way to do\\nthis is to pick a point that we know sits on G of X,\\nand they in fact give us one. They show us right over\\nhere that at the point two comma negative one, sits on G of X. When X is equal to two, Y is equal to negative one on G of X. So you could say G of two is negative one. Now on our green function,\\nwhen X is equal to two Y is equal to negative four. So let's see. Maybe we can just multiply\\nthis by 1/4 to get our G. So let's see. If we were to, let's\\nsee if we scale by 1/4, does that do the trick? Scale by 1/4. So in that case, we're gonna have Y is equal to not just negative X squared, but negative 1/4 X squared. And if you're saying hey,\\nso how did you get 1/4? Well I looked at when X is equal to two. On our green function,\\nwhen X is equal to two I get to negative four. Well we want that when X is equal to two to be equal to negative one. Well negative one is 1/4 of negative four, so that's why I said\\nokay, well let's up take to see if we could take\\nour green function, and if I multiply it by 1/4, that seems like it will\\nmatch up with G of X. And so let's verify that. When X is equal to\\nzero, well this is still all gonna be equal to\\nzero so that makes sense. When X is equal to one, let me do this in another color, when X is equal to one, then one squared times negative 1/4, well that does indeed look\\nlike negative 1/4 right there. When X is equal to two,\\ntwo squared is four, times negative 1/4 is indeed\\nequal to negative one. Let's try this point\\nhere 'cause it looks like this is sitting on our graph as well. When X is equal to four,\\nfour squared is 16. 16 times negative 1/4 is\\nindeed equal to negative four. And it does work also for the\\nnegative values of X as well. So I'm feeling really good that this is the equation of G of X. G of X is equal to negative\\n1/4 times X squared. And so in general, that\\nwhen we were saying we were scaling it, we're\\nscaling it by negative value. This is what flips it over the x-axis, and then multiplying it by this fraction that has an absolute value less than one, this is actually stretching it wider. If this value right over here, its absolute value was greater than one, then it would stretch it vertically, or would make it thinner in\\nthe horizontal direction. \"),\n",

So for example, any integer\\nis a rational number. 1 can be represented as 1/1 or\\nas negative 2 over negative 2 or as 10,000/10,000. In all of these cases, these are\\nall different representations of the number 1,\\nratio of two integers. And I obviously can\\nhave an infinite number of representations\\nof 1 in this way, the same number over\\nthe same number. The number negative 7 could be\\nrepresented as negative 7/1, or 7 over negative 1, or\\nnegative 14 over positive 2. And I could go on, and\\non, and on, and on. So negative 7 is definitely\\na rational number. It can be represented as\\nthe ratio of two integers. But what about things\\nthat are not integers? For example, let us imagine--\\noh, I don't know-- 3.75. How can we represent that as\\nthe ratio of two integers? Well, 3.75, you\\ncould rewrite that as 375/100, which is the\\nsame thing as 750/200. Or you could say, hey,\\n3.75 is the same thing as 3 and 3/4-- so let\\nme write it here-- which is the same\\nthing as-- that's 15/4. 4 times 3 is 12, plus 3 is\\n15, so you could write this. This is the same thing as 15/4. Or we could write this as\\nnegative 30 over negative 8. I just multiplied the\\nnumerator and the denominator here by negative 2. But just to be clear,\\nthis is clearly rational. I'm giving you multiple\\nexamples of how this can be represented as\\nthe ratio of two integers. Now, what about\\nrepeating decimals? Well, let's take\\nmaybe the most famous of the repeating decimals. Let's say you have 0.333, just\\nkeeps going on and on forever, which we can denote by\\nputting that little bar on top of the 3. This is 0.3 repeating. And we've seen--\\nand later we'll show how you can convert\\nany repeating decimal as the ratio of two integers--\\nthis is clearly 1/3. Or maybe you've seen things like\\n0.6 repeating, which is 2/3. And there's many, many,\\nmany other examples of this. And we'll see any\\nrepeating decimal, not just one digit repeating. Even if it has a million\\ndigits repeating, as long as the pattern\\nstarts to repeat itself over and over and\\nover again, you can always represent that as\\nthe ratio of two integers. So I know what you're\\nprobably thinking. Hey, Sal, you've\\njust included a lot. You've included all\\nof the integers. You've included all of finite\\nnon-repeating decimals, and you've also included\\nrepeating decimals. What is left? Are there any numbers\\nthat are not rational? And you're probably\\nguessing that there are, otherwise people\\nwouldn't have taken the trouble of trying to\\nlabel these as rational. And it turns out-- as you\\ncan imagine-- that actually some of the most famous\\nnumbers in all of mathematics are not rational. And we call these numbers\\nirrational numbers. And I've listed there\\njust a few of the most noteworthy examples. Pi-- the ratio of\\nthe circumference to the diameter of a circle--\\nis an irrational number. It never terminates. It goes on and on and on\\nforever, and it never repeats. e, same thing-- never\\nterminates, never repeats. It comes out of continuously\\ncompounding interest. It comes out of\\ncomplex analysis. e shows up all over the place. Square root of 2,\\nirrational number. Phi, the golden ratio,\\nirrational number. So these things that\\nreally just pop out of nature, many of these\\nnumbers are irrational. Now, you might say, OK,\\nare these irrational? These are just these\\nspecial kind of numbers. But maybe most\\nnumbers are rational, and Sal's just picked out\\nsome special cases here. But the important thing to\\nrealize is they do seem exotic, and they are exotic\\nin certain ways. But they aren't uncommon. It actually turns out\\nthat there is always an irrational number between\\nany two rational numbers. Well, we could go on and on. There's actually\\nan infinite number. But there's at least one,\\nso that gives you an idea that you can't\\nreally say that there are fewer irrational numbers\\nthan rational numbers. And in a future\\nvideo, we'll prove that you give me two rational\\nnumbers-- rational 1, rational 2-- there's going to be\\nat least one irrational number between those, which\\nis a neat result, because irrational\\nnumbers seem to be exotic. Another way to think about it--\\nI took the square root of 2, but you take the square root\\nof any non-perfect square, you're going to end up\\nwith an irrational number. You take the sum\\nof an irrational and a rational number-- and\\nwe'll see this later on. We'll prove it to ourselves. The sum of an irrational\\nand a rational is going to be irrational.

So if you give me the product\\nof any two rational numbers, you're going to end up\\nwith a rational number. Let's see if the same thing\\nis true for the sum of two rational numbers. So let's say my first\\nrational number is a/b, or can be represented as a/b, and\\nmy second rational number can be represented as m/n. Well, how would I add these two? Well, I can find a\\ncommon denominator, and the easiest\\none is b times n. So let me multiply\\nthis fraction. We multiply this one times\\nn in the numerator and n in the denominator. And let me multiply\\nthis one times b in the numerator and\\nb in the denominator. Now we've written\\nthem so they have a common denominator of bn. And so this is going to\\nbe equal to an plus bm, all of that over b times n. So b times n, we've\\njust talked about. This is definitely going to\\nbe an integer right over here. And then what do\\nwe have up here? Well, we have a times\\nn, which is an integer. b times m is another integer. The sum of two integers\\nis going to be an integer. So you have an integer\\nover in an integer. You have the ratio\\nof two integers. So the sum of two\\nrational numbers is going to give you another. So this one right over\\nhere was rational, and this one is right\\nover here is rational. So you take the product\\nof two rational numbers, you get a rational number. You take the sum of\\ntwo rational numbers, you get a rational number. \"),\n",

Assume that a rational\\ntimes an irrational gets you a rational number, and\\nthen see by manipulating it, whether you can establish that\\nall of a sudden this irrational number must somehow be rational.

So let's just assume that a\\nrational times an irrational gives us a rational number. So let's say that this-- to\\nrepresent this rational right over here, let's represent\\nit as the ratio of two integers, a over b. And then this irrational\\nnumber, I'll just call that x.

So let's see if we can set\\nup some form of contradiction here. Let's solve for the\\nirrational number. The best way to\\nsolve is to multiply both sides times the reciprocal\\nof this number right over here. So this, let's multiply\\ntimes b/a, times b/a. And what are we left with? We get our irrational number\\nx being equal to m times b. Or we could just\\nwrite that as mb/na. So why is this interesting? Well, m is an integer,\\nb is an integer, so this whole numerator\\nis an integer. And then this whole\\ndenominator is some integer. So right over here, I have\\na ratio of two integers. So I've just expressed\\nwhat we assumed to be an irrational number,\\nI've just it expressed it as the ratio of two integers. So now we have x\\nmust be rational.

Well, to think about\\nthis, let's just assume it's going to be\\nrational and then see if this leads to any\\nform of contradiction. So let's assume\\nthat this is going to give us a rational number. So let's say that this\\nfirst rational number we can represent as the ratio\\nof two integers, a and b. Let's call this irrational\\nnumber, let's just call this x. And their sum gives us\\nanother rational number. Well, let's express\\nthat as the ratio of two other integers, m and n. So we're saying that a/b\\nplus x is equal to m/n. Well, another way of\\nthinking about it-- we could subtract\\na/b from both sides and we would get our\\nirrational number x is equal to m/n\\nminus a/b, which is the same thing as n\\ntimes b in the denominator. And then let's see. m/n is the same\\nthing as mb over nb. So this would be mb. I'm just adding\\nthese two fractions. mb minus-- Let's see. a/b is the same thing\\nas n times a over n times b.

       "  \"- [Instructor] Let's say\\nthat we have some number a and to that we are going\\nto add some number b and that sum is going to be equal to c. Let's say that we're also told that both a and b are irrational. Irrational. So based on the information\\nthat I've given you, a and b are both irrational. Is their sum, c, is that going\\nto be rational or irrational? I encourage you to pause the video and try to answer that on your own. I'm guessing that you might have struggled with this a little bit\\nbecause the answer is that we actually don't know. It depends on what irrational\\nnumbers a and b actually are. What do I mean by that? Well, I can pick two irrational numbers where their sum actually\\nis going to be rational. What do I mean? Well what if a is equal to pi and b is equal to one minus pi? Now both of these are irrational numbers. Pi is irrational and one minus\\npi, whatever this value is, this is irrational as well. But if we add these two things together, if we add pi plus one minus pi, one minus pi, well these are gonna add up to be equal to one, which is clearly going\\nto be a rational number. So we were able to find one scenario in which we added two irrationals and the sum gives us a rational. In general you could do this trick with any irrational number. Instead of pi you could've had square root of two plus one\\nminus the square root of two. Both of these, what we have in this\\norange color is irrational, what we have in this\\nblue color is irrational, but the sum is going to be rational. And you could do this,\\ninstead of having one minus, you could have this as 1/2 minus. You could have done it a bunch\\nof different combinations so that you could end up\\nwith a sum that is rational. But you could also easily\\nadd two irrational numbers and still end up with\\nan irrational number. For example, if a is pi and b is pi, well then their sum is\\ngoing to be equal to two pi, which is still irrational. Or if you added pi plus the square root of two, this is still going to be irrational. In fact, mathematically\\nI would just express this as pi plus the square root of two. This is some number right over here, but this is still going to be irrational. So the big takeaway is\\nif you're taking the sums of two irrational numbers and people don't tell you anything else, they don't tell you which specific irrational numbers they are, you don't know whether their sum is going to be rational or irrational. Now let's think about products. Similar exercise, let's\\nsay we have a times b is equal to c, ab is equal to c, a times b is equal to c. And once again, let's\\nsay someone tells you that both a and b are irrational. Pause this video and think about whether c must be rational, irrational, or whether we just don't know. Try to figure out some examples like we just did when we looked at sums. Alright, so let's think about, let's see if we can construct examples where c ends up being rational. Well one thing, as you\\ncan tell I like to use pi, pi might be my favorite irrational number. If a was one over pi and b is pi, well, what's their product going to be? Well, their product is going\\nto be one over pi times pi, that's just going to be pi\\nover pi, which is equal to one. Here we got a situation where\\nthe product of two irrationals became, or is, rational. But what if I were to multiply, and in general you could this with a lot of irrational numbers, one over square root of two\\ntimes the square of two, that would be one. What if instead I had pi times pi? Pi times pi, that you could\\njust write as pi squared, and pi squared is still\\ngoing to be irrational. This is irrational, irrational. It isn't even always the case that if you multiply the\\nsame irrational number, if you square an irrational number that it's always going to be irrational. For example, if I have\\nsquare root of two times, I think you see where this is going, times the square root of two, I'm taking the product of\\ntwo irrational numbers. In fact, they're the\\nsame irrational number, but the square root of two\\ntimes the square root of two, well, that's just going\\nto be equal to two, which is clearly a rational number. So once again, when\\nyou're taking the product of two irrational numbers, you don't know whether the product is going to be rational or irrational unless someone tells you\\nthe specific numbers. Whether you're taking the product or the sum of irrational numbers, in order to know whether\\nthe resulting number is irrational or rational,\\nyou need to know something about what you're taking\\nthe sum or the product of. \"),\n",

So it can clearly be expressed\\nas the ratio of two integers. But what about the\\nsquare root of 45? So let's think about\\nthat a little bit. Square root of 45. That's the same thing as the\\nsquare root of 9 times 5, which is the same thing\\nas the square root of 9 times the square root of 5. The principal root\\nof 9 is 3, so it's 3 times the square root of 5. So this is going to be 9 plus\\n3 times the square root of 5. So the square root\\nof 5 is irrational. You're taking the square root\\nof a non-perfect square right over here. Irrational. 3 is rational, but the product\\nof a rational and an irrational is still going to be irrational.

Well, the numerator\\ncan be rewritten as the square root of 9 times\\n5 over 3 times the square root of 5. Well, that's the same\\nthing as the square root of 9 times the square root of\\n5 over 3 times the square root of 5. Well, that's the same thing as\\n3 times the square root of 5 over 3 times the\\nsquare root of 5. Well, that's just\\ngoing to be equal to 1. Or you could view it as 1/1.

So what is a over b going to be? a over b is going to be m over n over p over q which is equal to m over n,\\nif I divide by a fraction, it's the same thing as\\nmultiplying by the reciprocal. q over p, let me write that a little bit, q over p which is equal to mq over np. Well mq is going to be an\\ninteger, if the product of two integers is going to be\\nan integer, and np is going to be another integer, the\\nproduct of two integers is an integer, so I've just shown that a over b can be expressed as the ratio of\\ntwo integers, so a over b is for sure, in fact I've just\\nproven it to you, a over b is for sure going to be rational. Let's do a few more of\\nthese, this is interesting. All right, so now we're saying let a and b be irrational numbers. Is a over b, let a and\\nb be irrational numbers. Is a over b rational or irrational? And, like always, pause\\nthe video and try to think this through, and you\\nmight want do some examples of some irrational numbers\\nand see if you can get, when you divide them, you can get rational or irrational numbers. Well, let's just imagine\\na world where, let's say, that a is equal to, I dunno, two square roots of two, and b is equal to the square root of two. Well, in that world, a\\nover b, a over b would be two square roots of two\\nover the square root of two which would be two, which is\\nvery much a rational number, I can express that as a ratio\\nof integers, I can write that as two over one, there's actually\\nan infinite number of ways I can express that as a\\nratio of two integers. So, in this case, I was able\\nto get a over b to be rational, based on a and b being irrational. But, what if, what if instead of, what if a was equal to the square root of two and b is equal to the square root of, let's say, b is equal\\nto the square root of seven. Well, then a over b would\\nbe equal to the square root of two over the square root\\nof seven, which is still going to be irrational, I\\nmean another way to think about it, and I'm not proving\\nit here, but you could think about it, this is\\ngoing to be the square root of two sevens, so we\\nhave something that's not a perfect square under the\\nradical, so we're going to end up with an irrational number. So, we can show one example where a over b is rational and we showed one example where it is irrational,\\nso it can be either way. Let's do a few more of these. All right, let a be a\\nnon-zero rational number. Is a times the square root of\\neight rational or irrational? Well, the key here is, if you\\nmultiply an irrational number and why is this an irrational number? It has a perfect square\\nin it, but it's not a perfect square in and of itself. The square root of eight is,\\nthe square root of eight is equal to the square\\nroot of four times two, which is equal to the\\nsquare root of four times the square root of two, which is equal to two square roots of two. And, this is kind of\\ngetting to the punchline of this problem, but if I\\nmultiply a rational times an irrational, I am going\\nto get an irrational. So the square root of\\neight is an irrational, and if I multiply that\\ntimes a rational number, I'm still going to get\\nan irrational number. So this is going to be,\\nfor sure, irrational. Let's do one more of these. So we're to let a be an irrational number. Is negative 24 plus a\\nrational or irrational? And I won't give a formal\\nproof here, but to give you more of an intuitive feel,\\nit's nice to just try out some numbers, and I encourage\\nyou to pause the video and try to think through it yourself. Let's just imagine some values,\\nimagine if a is irrational, a is irrational, so what\\nif a was equal to negative pi, which is approximately\\nequal to negative three point one four one five nine and it keeps going on and on forever, never repeating. Well, then we would have negative 24 plus a would be equal to negative 24 minus pi, which would be approximately negative 27 point one for one five\\nnine, the decimal expansion, everything to the right of\\nthe decimal, is going to be the exact same thing as pi. So this looks like, at least\\nfor this example, is going to be irrational, and let's\\nsee, if a was square root of two negative 24 plus the square root of two, well, once again, I'm\\nnot doing a proof here, but intuitively, this is\\ngoing to be a decimal, it's going to have a decimal expansion that's going to go on\\nforever and never repeat, and so this would just\\nchange what's to the left of the decimal, but not\\nreally change what's, well it would change what's\\nto the right of the decimal because this is negative,\\nbut it's still going to go on forever and never repeat,\\nand if, in fact, this was if this was this way, then\\nto the right of the decimal, you would have the same thing\\nas the square root of two to the left of the decimal,\\nyou would just have a different value, you\\nwould have negative 25 point whatever whatever whatever,\\nand so this is, when you add a rational number to an\\nirrational number, we've proven in other videos, a\\nrational plus an irrational is going to be irrational, irrational.

And the proof by\\ncontradiction is set up by assuming the opposite. So this is our goal, but\\nfor the sake of our proof, let's assume the opposite. Let's assume that square\\nroot of 2 is rational. And then we'll see if we\\nlead to a contradiction, that this actually\\ncannot be the case. And if it cannot be the\\ncase that is rational, if we get to a contradiction by\\nassuming the square root of 2 is rational, then we have to\\ndeduce that the square root of 2 must be irrational. So let's assume the opposite. Square root of 2 is rational. Well, if the square\\nroot of 2 is rational, that means that we can\\nwrite the square root of 2 as the ratio of two\\nintegers, a and b. And we can also\\nassume that these have no factors in common. Let's say that they did\\nhave some factors in common. If we divided the numerator\\nand the denominator by those same factors, then\\nyou're getting into a situation where they have no\\nfactors in common. Or another way of saying is\\nthat a and b are co-prime. Or another way of\\nsaying it is we could write this as a\\nratio of two integers where this is irreducible,\\nwhere these no longer share any factors. If you can write anything as\\nthe ratio of two integers, then you could obviously\\nsimplify it further, factor out any common\\nfactors to get it to a point where it is irreducible. So I'm going to assume\\nthat my a and b, that this fraction right\\nover here, is irreducible. And this is important for\\nsetting up our contradiction. So I'm going to assume that this\\nright over here is irreducible. a and b have no\\nfactors in common. Let me write that\\ndown because that's so important for this proof. a and-- want to do\\nthat same color-- a and b have no factors in\\ncommon, other than, I guess, 1. So this is irreducible. These two numbers are co-prime. So what does that do for us? Well, let's just try to\\nmanipulate this a little bit. Let's square both\\nsides of this equation. So if you square the\\nprincipal root of 2, you're going to get 2. And that's going to be equal\\nto a squared over b squared. And that just comes\\nfrom a over b squared is the same thing as a\\nsquared over b squared. And now we can multiply both\\nsides of this by b squared. And so we get 2 times b\\nsquared is equal to a squared. Now, what does this\\ntell us about a squared? Well, a squared is some\\nnumber, b squared times 2. So anything times 2 is going--\\nthis is going to be an integer. We assumed b is an integer, so\\nb squared must be an integer, and so you have an\\ninteger times 2. Well, that must give\\nyou an even number. That must give you\\nan even integer. So this right over\\nhere, a squared, must be-- so this tells us\\nthat a squared must be even. Now, why is that interesting? Well, a squared is the\\nproduct of two numbers or is the product\\nof the same number. It's a times a. So this is another way of\\nsaying that a times a is even. So what does that\\ntell us about a? Let's just remind ourselves. a is either going to\\nbe-- we're assuming a is an integer-- a is either\\ngoing to be even or odd. We just have to remind\\nourselves if we multiply an even times an even,\\nwe get an even number. If we multiply an odd times\\nan odd, we get an odd number. So we have a number\\ntimes itself. We got an even number. Well, the only way to get that\\nis if that number is even. So this tells us that a is even. And another way of\\nsaying that a is even is to say that a\\ncan be represented as the product of 2\\ntimes some integer. So let's say some integer k. So where is all of this going? Well, as you'll\\nsee, we can then use this to show that b\\nmust also be even. So let's think about\\nthat a little bit. So let's go back to this\\nstep right over here. If we say that a\\ncan be represented as two times the\\nproduct of some integer, and that comes out of\\nthe fact that a is even. Then we can rewrite this\\nexpression right over here as 2-- I'll do it\\nover here-- 2 times b squared is equal\\nto 2k squared. Instead of a squared, I\\ncould write 2k squared. We're claiming,\\nor we're deducing, that, assuming everything we've\\njust assumed, that a is even. So if a is even, it\\ncan be represented as a product of 2\\nand some integer. And then we can write\\nthat 2 times b squared is equal to 4k squared. And then you divide\\nboth sides by 2. You get b squared is\\nequal to 2k squared. And this tells us\\nthat, well, k squared is going to be an integer. You take any integer\\ntimes 2 you're going to get an even value. So this tells us that\\nb squared is even. So that tells us that\\nb squared is even. Well, if b squared is even, by\\nthe same logic we just used, that tells us that b is even. So here's our contradiction. We assumed, in the\\nbeginning, that a and b have no common\\nfactors other than 1. We assumed that this fraction\\nright over here, a/b, is irreducible. But from that and\\nthe fact that a/b must be equal to the\\nsquare root of 2, we were able to deduce that\\na is even and b is even. Well, if a is even\\nand b is even, and they both have\\n2 as a factor, and then this isn't irreducible. You could divide the numerator\\nand the denominator by 2. a and b have a common factor of 2. So let me write this down. So this is just\\nto make it clear. So from this and this, we have\\na and b have common factor of 2, which means that a\\nover b is reducible. And so that's the contradiction. So you assume that\\nsquare root of 2 can be represented as an\\nirreducible fraction a/b, irreducible because you can\\nsay ratio of two integers right over here, that leads\\nyou to the contradiction that, no, it actually\\ncan be reducible. So, therefore, you cannot\\nmake this assumption. It leads to a contradiction. Square root of 2\\nmust be irrational. \"),\n",

So let's assume that p is prime. And we're going to set this up\\nto be a proof by contradiction. So we're going to assume\\nthat the square root of p is rational and see if this\\nleads us to any contradiction. So if something\\nis rational, that means that we can represent it\\nas the ratio of two integers.

So let's see if we can\\nmanipulate this a little bit. Let's take the\\nsquare of both sides. We get p is equal to-- well,\\na/b, the whole thing squared, that's the same thing as\\na squared over b squared. We can multiply both\\nsides by b squared, and we get b squared times\\np is equal to a squared. Well, what does this\\ntell us about a squared? Well, b is an integer, so b\\nsquared must be an integer. So an integer times p\\nis equal to a squared. Well, that means that p must\\nbe a factor of a squared. Let me write this down. So a squared is a multiple of p. Now, what does that\\ntell us about a? Does that tell us that a\\nmust also be a multiple of p? Well, to think about\\nthat, let's think about the prime\\nfactorization of a. Let's say that a can\\nbe-- and any number-- can be rewritten as a\\nproduct of primes. Or any integer, I should say. So let's write this out\\nas a product of primes right over here. So let's say that I have\\nmy first prime factor times my second prime factor, all\\nthe way to my nth prime factor. I don't know how many prime\\nfactors a actually has. I'm just saying that a is\\nsome integer right over here. So that's the prime\\nfactorization of a. What is the prime factorization\\nof a squared going to be? Well, a squared\\nis just a times a. Its prime factorization is\\ngoing to be f1 times f2, all the way to fn. And then that times f1 times\\nf2 times, all the way to fn. Or I could rearrange\\nthem if I want. f1 times f1 times f2 times f2,\\nall the way to fn times fn. Now, we know that a squared\\nis a multiple of p. p is a prime number,\\nso p must be one of these numbers in the\\nprime factorization. p could be f2, or p\\ncould be f1, but p needs to be one of these numbers\\nin the prime factorization. So p needs to be one\\nof these factors. Well, if it's, let's\\nsay-- and I'll just pick one of these arbitrarily. Let's say that p is f2. If p is f2, then that means\\nthat p is also a factor of a. So this allows us to deduce\\nthat a is a multiple of p. Or another way of saying\\nthat is that we can represent a as being some integer times p. Now, why is that interesting? And actually, let\\nme box this off, because we're going to\\nreuse this part later. But how can we use this? Well, just like we did in the\\nproof of the square root of 2 being irrational, let's\\nnow substitute this back into this equation\\nright over here. So we get b squared times p. We have b squared times\\np is equal to a squared. Well, a, we're now\\nsaying we can represent that as some integer k times p. So we can rewrite that as\\nsome integer k times p. And so, let's see, if we\\nwere to multiply this out. So we get b squared times\\np-- and you probably see where this is going--\\nis equal to k squared times p squared. We can divide both\\nsides by p, and we get b squared is equal\\nto p times k squared. Or k squared times p. Well, the same\\nargument that we used, if a squared is equal to b\\nsquared times p, that let us know that a squared\\nis a multiple of p. So now we have it\\nthe other way around. b squared is equal to\\nsome integer squared, which is still going to\\nbe an integer, times p. So b squared must\\nbe a multiple of p. So this lets us know that b\\nsquared is a multiple of p. And by the logic\\nthat we applied right over here, that lets us know\\nthat b is a multiple of p. And that's our contradiction,\\nor this establishes our contradiction that we\\nassumed at the beginning. We assumed that a\\nand b are co-prime, that they share no factors\\nin common other than 1. We assumed that this\\ncannot be reduced. But we've just established,\\njust from this, we have deduced that\\nis a multiple of p and b is a multiple of p. Which means that this\\nfraction can be reduced. We can divide the numerator\\nand the denominator by p. So that is our contradiction. We started assuming\\nit cannot be reduced, but then we showed that, no,\\nit must be able to be reduced. The numerator and\\nthe denominator have a common factor of p. So our contradiction\\nis established. Square root of p\\ncannot be rational. Square root of p is irrational. Let me just write it down. The square root of p\\nis irrational because of the contradiction. \"),\n",

       "  \"What I want to do in this video\\nis prove that between any two rational numbers-- so let's say\\nthat's a rational number there, and then let's say that this\\nis another rational number that is larger than\\nthis one right over here-- that between any\\ntwo rational numbers, you can find an\\nirrational number. So that number right\\nover there is irrational. You can find at least\\none irrational number. And that's kind of\\ncrazy, because there's a lot of rational numbers. There's an infinite number\\nof rational numbers. So we're saying between any\\ntwo of those rational numbers, you can always find\\nan irrational number. And we're going to start\\nthinking about it by just thinking about the\\ninterval between 0 and 1. So if we think about the\\ninterval between 0 and 1, we know that there are\\nirrational numbers there. In fact, one of them\\nthat might pop out at you is 1 over the square\\nroot of 2, which is the same thing as the\\nsquare root of 2 over 2, is equal-- I\\nshouldn't say equal, is roughly, is approximately\\nequal to 0.70710678118. And I could just\\nkeep going on and on and on and on and on and on. This thing does not repeat. But the important point is,\\nit's clearly between 0 and 1. So I could write 1 over\\nthe square root of 2 is clearly between 0 and 1. So the way that I'm going\\nto prove that there's an irrational number between\\nany two rational numbers is I'm going to start with\\nthis set of inequalities, and I'm going to\\nmanipulate it so I end up with an r1 over here\\nand an r2 over here. And then from 1 over\\nthe square root of 2, I would have manipulated\\nthis to construct that irrational-- at least\\none of the irrational numbers that's between those\\ntwo rational ones. So instead of making this\\nan interval between 0 and 1, let's make this an\\ninterval between 0 and the difference\\nbetween these two numbers. So the distance between\\nr1 and r2 is r2 minus r1. So let's multiply\\nboth sides of this-- or all three parts\\nof this inequality, I guess I could say, by\\nr2 times r2 minus r1. So let's do that. So if you multiply this,\\n0 times r2 minus r1, well you're just still\\ngoing to have 0 there, is less than-- And we know\\nthat r2 is greater than r1, so r2 minus-- let me make\\nit clear what we're doing. We're going to multiply\\neverything times r2 minus r1. r2, we're assuming,\\nis greater than r1, so this thing right over here\\nis going to be greater than 0. So if you multiply\\nthe different sides of an inequality by\\nsomething greater than 0, you don't switch the inequality. So 0 times that is 0, 1 over\\nthe square root of 2 times that is going to be 1\\nover the square root of 2 times r2 minus r1. And then that's going\\nto be less than-- well, 1 times that is just\\ngoing to be r2 minus r1. And now, we just have to kind\\nof shift everything over. So let's add r1 to\\nall sides of this. So if we add something to\\nall parts of the inequality, then that's also not going\\nto change the inequality. So we're going to\\nadd r1 over here. We can add r1 over here. And we can add r1 over there. And so on the\\nleft-hand side, we have r1 is less than r1 plus--\\nlet me just copy and paste all of this so I don't have\\nto keep changing colors. Whoops, that's not\\nwhat I wanted to do. Let me do this. There you go. All right. That should be pretty good. So copy and paste that. r1 plus this, plus that--\\nlet me write the plus down-- plus that, is less\\nthan-- that one is a different shade of\\nblue-- is less than-- well, what's r1 plus r2 minus r1? Well, that's just\\ngoing to be r2. So I've just shown\\nyou that you give me any two rational\\nnumbers, and I'm assuming r2 is greater\\nthan r1, I have just constructed an\\nirrational number that's going to be between those\\ntwo rational numbers. You take r1, you take the\\nlower of the rational numbers, and to that you add\\n1 over square root of 2 times the difference\\nbetween those two rational numbers,\\nand you are going to get this right over here\\nis an irrational number. You're saying hey, how do\\nI know that this thing-- how can I be satisfied that\\nthis thing is irrational? Well, we've already seen. You take the product of an\\nirrational and a rational, you get an irrational number. You take the sum of\\nan irrational number and a rational number, you\\nget an irrational number. So we've constructed\\nan irrational number that's between\\nthese two rationals. \")]"

      "\n",
      "_\"Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes-- I mean the universe-- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.\"_\n",
      "\n",
      "This deep and dramatic quote really gets to the **true point of mathematics**, especially algebra. As we go deeper into algebra, we abstract ideas and discover the core concepts that explain how our universe is structured.\n",
      "\n",
      "### A Simple Idea: Discounts\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take a simple, concrete idea to understand abstract concepts. Suppose we're at a store where everything is on sale at **30% off**.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a pair of pants costs $20 before the discount, how much would we pay after the discount?\n",
      "\n",
      "We calculate it by multiplying the discount percentage by the price:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\text{discount} = 0.30 \\times 20 = 6 \\, \\text{dollars}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the discount is $6. This means we would pay $14 in total ($20 - $6).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Generalizing Discounts\n",
      "\n",
      "What if we want to calculate the discount on any item? Let's introduce a variable, **\\( x \\)**, which represents the price of any item.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here is a **picture of Rene Descartes**. He was one of the great minds in both math and philosophy. Interestingly, many great philosophers were also great mathematicians. \n",
      "\n",
      "Descartes was a contemporary of Galileo, 32 years younger, though he passed away shortly after Galileo, at the age of 54. Galileo lived into his 70s. Descartes is perhaps most known for his philosophical quote, **\"I think, therefore I am\"**. But he also said something very practical, **\"You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing.\"** This shows that even the great minds were human and faced challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### His Contribution to Algebra and Geometry\n",
      "\n",
      "Descartes is crucial to our study of algebra because he created a strong connection between **algebra and geometry**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Algebra** deals with **equations** and **symbols** that can take on values. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$ y = 2x - 1 $$\n",
      "\n",
      "This equation shows a relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). We can create a table to pick values for \\( x \\) and see what \\( y \\) would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "| \\( x \\) | \\( y \\) |\n",
      "| ------ | ------- |\n",
      "| -2 | -5 |\n",
      "| -1 | -3 |\n",
      "| 0  | -1 |\n",
      "| 1  |  1 |\n",
      "| 2  |  3 |\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "- If \\( x \\) is \\( -2 \\), \\( y \\) is \\( 2 \\times (-2) - 1 = -5 \\).\n",
      "- If \\( x \\) is \\( 1 \\), \\( y \\) is \\( 2 \\times 1 - 1 = 1 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Descartes' Idea\n",
      "\n",
      "Descartes figured out that we could **visualize** these relationships. He bridged **abstract algebra** with **geometry**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Geometry** deals with shapes, sizes, and angles. Before Descartes, it was mainly Euclidean geometry, which you study in school (triangles, circles, etc.). \n",
      "\n",
      "Descartes said we could use a **two-dimensional plane** (like a sheet of paper) to show these relationships. There are two directions:\n",
      "- **Up/Down** (vertical or \\( y \\)-axis)\n",
      "- **Left/Right** (horizontal or \\( x \\)-axis)\n",
      "\n",
      "By convention, we put the dependent variable (\\( y \\)) on the vertical axis and the independent variable (\\( x \\)) on the horizontal axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "He started with numbering the axes: \n",
      "\n",
      "Along the \\( x \\)-axis:\n",
      "- \\(\\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "And along the \\( y \\)-axis:\n",
      "- \\(\\ldots, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "Each pair \\((x, y)\\) can be a point on the plane. For example:\n",
      "- The pair \\( (-2, -5) \\) is a point located 2 units left and 5 units down from the origin (0, 0).\n",
      "\n",
      "These points, like \\((-2, -5)\\), \\((-1, -3)\\), \\((0, -1)\\), \\((1, 1)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), are called **Cartesian coordinates**, named after Descartes.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Connecting Algebra with Geometry\n",
      "\n",
      "By plotting points from our table in a two-dimensional plane, we can see that these points form a **line**. Descartes realized that:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Any point on the line** is a solution to the equation.\n",
      "2. **Any equation of this form** will plot out into a line, which we call a **linear equation**.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the point \\( (1.5, 2) \\) is a solution to the equation, because \\( 2 \\times 1.5 - 1 = 2 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Descartes created a bridge between algebra (equations) and geometry (visual shapes), and this is why we use **Cartesian coordinates** to plot points and visualize relationships between variables. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first type of equations you'll study are **linear equations**. When plotted, they form a straight **line**.\n",
      "\n",
      "In future lessons, we'll see other types of equations that don't form lines but create more complex shapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "- Rene Descartes connected algebra and geometry.\n",
      "- Algebra uses symbols and relationships.\n",
      "- Geometry uses shapes and measurements.\n",
      "- Cartesian coordinates (named after Descartes) help visualize relationships.\n",
      "- Linear equations form straight lines when plotted on a graph.\n",
