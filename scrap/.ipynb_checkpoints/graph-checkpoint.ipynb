       "\"1\\nforeign\\n3\\n[Music]\\n10\\nhead of Outreach at y combinator so I've\\n14\\nbeen at YC for about nine years now and\\n16\\nthat means I've seen over 3 500\\n18\\ncompanies go through the program and\\n20\\nlaunch at YC one of the things my team\\n23\\ndoes is help companies with their first\\n25\\nlaunches and today I want to change the\\n28\\nway you think about launching most\\n31\\nFounders overthink their first launch\\n33\\nthey think they have just one shot at\\n36\\nlaunching their product publicly and\\n38\\nthat the messaging has to be perfect or\\n40\\nthat no one will ever buy or use or\\n44\\ninvest in their product\\n45\\nI talked to Founders constantly who\\n48\\nlovingly prepare their launch for months\\n51\\nbut if you're like most startups you'll\\n54\\nlaunch something and no one will care\\n56\\nand if it takes you six months to get\\n58\\nthe first version of your product in\\n60\\nfront of anyone your startup may be dead\\n62\\nbefore you get another chance to launch\\n64\\nSo In The Same Spirit of always be\\n67\\nshipping I want you to think about\\n69\\nlaunching as something that you do\\n71\\ncontinually so here's what we're going\\n73\\nto talk about today first we'll talk\\n75\\nabout when to launch and why second\\n77\\nwe'll walk through some strong one-line\\n79\\ncompany descriptions including some that\\n82\\nI pulled from the startup School\\n83\\ncommunity and third we'll talk about the\\n85\\ntypes of launches you can do during\\n87\\nstartup school so first a lot of people\\n90\\nask when should I launch and the answer\\n93\\nis ASAP it's probably right now why so\\n98\\nFounders are really good at lying to\\n101\\nthemselves a lot of you have really\\n103\\nstrong convictions about what you're\\n105\\nbuilding and that's good Founders need\\n108\\nthat conviction but many of you have\\n110\\nstrong but theoretical Notions of how\\n113\\nyou're going to solve a problem and how\\n115\\npeople are going to interact with what\\n117\\nyou're building so putting your product\\n119\\nout there even in its earliest state\\n121\\nwill help you determine whether you're\\n123\\nsolving a big enough problem that\\n125\\nsomeone is willing to pay for you or use\\n127\\nyou even in the products really\\n130\\nunpolished state so if you launch too\\n133\\nearly what's the worst case scenario\\n136\\nwhat's the worst thing that can happen\\n137\\npeople might think the product is ugly\\n140\\nor it sucks investors might hear about\\n143\\nthe product before it's ready you know\\n144\\ncompetitors might see it or Worse no one\\n148\\nwill see it or no one will care and\\n150\\nthat's fine just launch again\\n153\\nAirbnb launched three times before they\\n156\\nreally started to get users launching\\n158\\nand having no one care that feels\\n160\\nterrible but it's not a reason to give\\n162\\nup it's a reason to iterate and launch\\n165\\nagain launch and iterate launch and\\n168\\niterate until you have a core of users\\n170\\nwho really love you Paul Buchheit he's\\n173\\nthe creator of Gmail and a long time YC\\n176\\ngroup partner he has said it's better to\\n178\\nmake a few people really happy than to\\n181\\nmake a lot of people semi-happy\\n184\\nso early on as long as you've made\\n186\\nsomething that a few users absolutely\\n189\\nlove you are on the right track it'll be\\n193\\ngood for your morale to have even a\\n194\\nhandful of users who really love what\\n196\\nyou're doing and it'll help you figure\\n199\\nout what to focus on\\n200\\nwhat is it about your product that they\\n202\\nlove and how can you do more of that\\n205\\nwhere can you find more users who love\\n208\\nthat sort of thing that you're doing if\\n210\\nyou have a core of users even 10 users\\n212\\nwho really love you all you have to do\\n214\\nis expand that number and it might take\\n216\\na while but if you keep going cockroach\\n219\\nstyle you can win in the end so now that\\n222\\nwe've determined you should all launch\\n224\\nlet's talk about something every one of\\n227\\nyou needs before you launch to create a\\n230\\nstrong one sentence pitch you need\\n233\\nClarity of vision\\n234\\nwe believe that people who have thought\\n236\\ndeeply and about about an idea can\\n239\\nexplain it clearly and succinctly they\\n242\\nuse less words they can explain con\\n245\\ncomplex Concepts in a way that a\\n247\\nfive-year-old can understand and having\\n249\\na clear idea is important because a\\n252\\nclear idea is the best foundation for\\n254\\ngrowth the best companies and movements\\n257\\ngrow organically by word of mouth and\\n260\\nthat's good news because Word of Mouth\\n262\\ngrowth is the cheapest way to grow and\\n264\\nif you think back to the first time you\\n266\\nheard about something like say tick tock\\n267\\nor a slack there's a good chance you've\\n270\\nheard about it through a friend or\\n272\\nco-worker talking about what you do\\n274\\nclearly and succinctly is going to be\\n276\\none of your most important jobs as a\\n278\\nFounder it's a skill that you'll need to\\n281\\nconvince potential co-founders investors\\n284\\nusers employees and eventually hopefully\\n287\\nshareholders to believe in you it's also\\n290\\na skill you'll need to grow to grow you\\n292\\nneed to get all these groups of people\\n293\\ntalking about you to help you spread the\\n296\\nword that's why it's necessary to make\\n298\\nit easy for anyone your grandfather or\\n300\\nthe person that you meet at the airport\\n302\\nto talk about what you're doing so that\\n305\\nword can spread about you virally when\\n307\\npeople sit down at the dinner table they\\n309\\nshould be talking about you and your\\n311\\ncompany and you don't have to be\\n313\\nnaturally good at talking about your\\n314\\ncompany at first it takes some of our\\n316\\nFounders at YC months to get comfortable\\n318\\ndoing this so here's how we think about\\n320\\ncoming up with a short memorable\\n322\\ndescription of your company so first we\\n325\\nrecommend leading with what not with why\\n328\\nand this may seem counterintuitive\\n331\\nbecause we tell most stories\\n333\\nchronologically it's natural to start\\n336\\nwith you know how you discover the\\n338\\nproblem you're solving and why it's\\n340\\nimportant\\n341\\nand one reason a lot of you do this is\\n343\\nbecause you're all very ambitious people\\n345\\nand you want to solve these big problems\\n347\\nand that's really awesome and Founders\\n349\\nneed that ambition but\\n351\\nwhen you only have a limited time with\\n354\\nsomeone it's important to give them\\n355\\ncontext up front so start with the\\n358\\ncompany name and what you do and there's\\n360\\nno need to set up the problem just get\\n362\\nto the point so I'll use a real example\\n365\\nfrom a YC companies application the\\n367\\ncompany is called pave if they'd started\\n369\\nwith why they were building this company\\n371\\nthey would have said many of my friends\\n373\\nare super confused about their stock\\n375\\noptions and it pisses me off how\\n378\\nstressed they get thinking about them\\n379\\nbut before you give me the back story\\n381\\nagain start with one sentence that tells\\n383\\nme what you're building First Press\\n385\\npeople and investors and even other\\n388\\nFounders get pitched tens of times per\\n391\\nyou know per day definitely per week and\\n394\\nthey have particularly short attention\\n396\\nspans so here's the actual description\\n399\\nof the company pave pave lets companies\\n401\\nplan communicate and Benchmark your\\n404\\ncompensation in real time this is a\\n407\\nstraightforward description of what\\n408\\nthey're building and who they're\\n409\\nbuilding for they are building 2 tools\\n412\\nto make compensation and pay more\\n414\\ntransparent for companies uh and and\\n417\\ntheir employees so hopefully whoever\\n419\\nyou're talking to asks follow-up\\n422\\nquestions and then you can get to the\\n424\\nwhy later so the second mistake Founders\\n427\\nmake is adding a lot of meaningless\\n429\\nmarketing speak to their pitches so this\\n431\\nis a tweet from Gary tan he said\\n433\\nmeaningless jargon is the number one\\n436\\nissue I spend time trying to fight when\\n438\\nhelping startups so here is an actual\\n441\\ndescription of a company don't worry\\n443\\nit's not a startup School company or a\\n445\\nYC company indiecloud is a know-how and\\n448\\nSynergy platform don't say like\\n451\\nthis it has zero informational content\\n453\\nabout what you actually do when you're\\n456\\ndescribing your company the person\\n458\\nyou're talking to should have some idea\\n460\\nof you know what they'd have to build to\\n462\\nreproduce what you're talking about a\\n465\\nknow-how Synergy platform could\\n466\\nliterally be anything it could be a\\n468\\ncollaborative edtech company or it could\\n470\\nbe a Marketplace for experts like you\\n473\\nliterally have no idea what you what\\n474\\nyou'd have to build to reproduce a\\n477\\nknow-how Synergy platform another\\n479\\nmistake Founders make is rambling they\\n481\\njust go on and on and on and don't do\\n483\\nthis the person you're talking to will\\n485\\nhave already zoned out so here's the\\n488\\nactual description Airbnb used on their\\n490\\nYC application we built the first Online\\n493\\nMarketplace that lets Travelers book\\n495\\nroom to locals instead of hotels this is\\n498\\na tight description it describes the\\n501\\nproblem they're solving and who they're\\n502\\nsolving it for so here's one I pulled\\n505\\nfrom the startup School Forum open queue\\n508\\nfind and talk to your target B2B users\\n511\\nfast again they tell you the problem\\n513\\nthey're solving and who they're solving\\n516\\nit for they're making it easy for B2B\\n518\\ncompanies to reach potential customers\\n520\\nand you can sort of imagine what you\\n522\\nmight have to build to reproduce what\\n524\\nthey're doing okay here's another one I\\n526\\npulled from the startup School Forum yum\\n529\\nit's a clever name adaptive ml driven\\n531\\nmental health for your team and I get\\n533\\nthis what this is It's a digital mental\\n536\\nhealth tools to help your team cope with\\n538\\nstress and burnout but I think you can\\n541\\nWorkshop it a little bit if you're\\n543\\nshowing this to potential customers I\\n545\\nthink they'll care less about the fact\\n547\\nthat the product is ml driven and more\\n549\\nabout the fact that it's personalized\\n551\\ndigital therapy so I I changed it up to\\n553\\npersonalized digital therapy programs\\n556\\nfor your team some people ask me whether\\n558\\nthe X for y construction is too cliche\\n561\\nto use when describing their company and\\n564\\nlet's be honest the term you know Uber\\n567\\nfor x or Airbnb B for X has been a bit\\n569\\noverused\\n570\\nI want to emphasize that all of you\\n572\\nshould have a one-line description that\\n574\\ndoes not use the X for y construction\\n576\\nbut the X for y construction can be used\\n580\\nin certain cases so for example paisy\\n583\\nwhich is a YC Alum can describe\\n586\\nthemselves as stripe for his former\\n588\\nSoviet Union countries but they could\\n590\\nalso describe themselves as payment\\n593\\nprocessing for former Soviet countries\\n595\\nbut let's talk about when it's okay to\\n598\\nuse the X for y Construction\\n600\\ngoing back to paisy if the founders are\\n603\\ntalking to people in Silicon Valley so\\n605\\ninvestors or press for example uh then\\n608\\nit might make sense you might use the X\\n610\\nfor y analogy if it really is the best\\n613\\nway to paint a picture of what you're\\n615\\nbuilding very quickly if you go with\\n617\\nthis construction you need three\\n619\\ningredients first of all X should be a\\n622\\nhousehold name\\n624\\nsecond it should be reasonably clear why\\n626\\ny might want X\\n628\\nand third y should be a huge market so\\n632\\none YC company described themselves\\n634\\nearly on as buffer for Snapchat even\\n637\\nknow buffer is doing well as a company\\n639\\nit's not a company that not everyone\\n641\\nnecessarily knows when I was reading\\n643\\nthis description in their YC application\\n645\\nI literally had to go to Google and\\n647\\nGoogle buffer so in this case you're\\n649\\nbetter off describing the problem that\\n652\\nyou're solving so here's an X for y\\n654\\nexample from the startup School\\n655\\ncommunity that I think works hark alive\\n657\\nis Airbnb for dance and movement classes\\n660\\nit paints a fast picture of what Harker\\n663\\nlive is but honestly you could also just\\n665\\nas easily say harkalive is a Marketplace\\n668\\nfor dance and movement classes so to\\n670\\nreview the best one-liners are\\n672\\ndescriptive they describe what you do\\n674\\nthe problem and who you're solving it\\n676\\nfor\\n677\\nthey're conversational and don't use\\n679\\njargon or marketing language and there's\\n681\\nno long-winded lead up they're concise\\n684\\nshort and sweet so now that you know\\n687\\nwhat you need for a good one sentence\\n689\\npitch let's talk about why you want to\\n692\\nlaunch continuously even before you have\\n694\\na fully functioning product\\n696\\nlaunching early gives you the chance to\\n699\\npractice and refine your idea you can a\\n702\\nB test the idea or messaging on people\\n704\\nyou get an opportunity to see how people\\n707\\nrespond to it and then once you have a\\n710\\nproduct launching through different\\n711\\nchannels will give you an opportunity to\\n714\\nsee how people respond to the actual\\n715\\nproduct and launching on different\\n717\\nchannels will also help you determine\\n719\\nwhether you're even talking to the right\\n721\\nusers different channels will naturally\\n723\\nreach different audiences so let's talk\\n726\\nabout some of the types of launches you\\n729\\ncan do in your early stages here are\\n731\\ndifferent types of launches and I'm\\n732\\ngoing to go through each one of these\\n734\\nbriefly so first is the silent launch\\n737\\nand this is something every one of you\\n739\\nshould do while you're in startup school\\n740\\nI clicked on 10 random startup School\\n743\\ncompanies today and only half of them\\n745\\nhad landing pages so you don't need\\n748\\nanything fancy at the very least you\\n751\\nneed a domain name your company name a\\n753\\nshort description a way for users to\\n756\\ncontact you and a call to action your\\n758\\ncall to action might be sign up for a\\n760\\nnewsletter or sign up to here when we\\n762\\nlaunch here's an example of a startup\\n764\\nSchool company landing page Lara they\\n767\\nhave their domain name a company name\\n769\\nshort description and a call to action\\n771\\nsign up for the wait list and this is\\n774\\nall you really need the next type of\\n776\\nlaunch is to friends and family\\n778\\neven if you're at idea stage you can\\n780\\ntest out your one to two sentence pitch\\n782\\non friends and family and once you have\\n784\\nan MVP you should do a friends and\\n787\\nfamily launch as quickly as possible so\\n790\\nin its earliest days Reddit was shared\\n793\\namong the founders of the first YC batch\\n796\\nI use the Wayback machine to find the\\n798\\nearliest view of Reddit I can find from\\n800\\n2005. so this was even before they\\n803\\ncalled upvotes upvotes so share your\\n806\\nproduct with friends and family watch\\n808\\nthem use the product and ask them for\\n810\\nfeedback but one thing about the friends\\n812\\nand family launch don't stay in this\\n814\\nphase for too long because your friends\\n816\\nand family might not be the ideal users\\n818\\nfor what you're building and sometimes\\n820\\ntheir feedback isn't going to be as\\n822\\nhelpful as a real users next type of\\n825\\nlaunch launching to strangers I want to\\n828\\nshare the MVP for doordash this is the\\n830\\nvery first version of the doordash site\\n832\\nwhen they first started out the founders\\n834\\nwere building other things they were\\n836\\nbuilding tech for small business owners\\n838\\nand so they started approaching store\\n840\\nowners for feedback and they spent a lot\\n843\\nof time talking to this one store\\n845\\nmanager Chloe she was the manager of a\\n847\\nmacaron store in Downtown Palo Alto in\\n850\\ntalking to Chloe they realized that the\\n851\\napp they were building really didn't\\n853\\nsolve any of her problems but just as\\n855\\nthey were about to leave Chloe always\\n856\\nsaid hey there's just one thing I want\\n858\\nto show you and it was this thick\\n860\\nbooklet with pages and pages of pages of\\n863\\ndelivery orders\\n864\\nshe said this drives me crazy I have no\\n866\\ndrivers to fulfill them and I'm the one\\n868\\ndoing all the deliveries over the course\\n870\\nof the next few weeks the founders\\n872\\ninterviewed over 200 small business\\n875\\nowners across the bay area and they kept\\n877\\nhearing the same issue deliveries are\\n880\\npainful\\n881\\nthen after they you know absorbed enough\\n884\\ninformation about the product they built\\n886\\nthis their MVP in just a few hours\\n890\\nso if they'd waited too long to get\\n893\\ndirect feedback from their customers\\n894\\nthey might have spent way longer you\\n896\\nknow six months plus building out the\\n899\\nwrong solution for small business owners\\n901\\nso I'd recommend you get out there even\\n903\\nif it makes you slightly uncomfortable\\n904\\nand start talking to your potential\\n906\\ncustomers as soon as possible do what\\n908\\ndoordash did and talk to 200. so next is\\n911\\none of my favorite ways to launch\\n913\\nthrough online communities so I think\\n916\\nyou should plan a launch for every\\n917\\nsingle community that you are part of\\n919\\nwhen a company goes through YC for\\n921\\nexample they have the option of\\n923\\nlaunching on Bookface before they launch\\n925\\npublicly Bookface is our internal\\n927\\nplatform for Founders it's like Facebook\\n929\\nmeets LinkedIn meets quora all for YC\\n932\\nFounders and there are currently over 6\\n935\\n000 Founders on bookbase so for many\\n937\\ncompanies in YC it's a good way to get\\n939\\nsome first users and some early feedback\\n942\\nand it's a fairly low risk way to launch\\n944\\nbecause you're launching in front of a\\n946\\nfriendly community of other Founders\\n947\\nthere are countless examples of\\n949\\ncompanies that have launched and gotten\\n951\\ntheir first or first thousand customers\\n953\\nthrough online communities another\\n955\\ncommunity that you have access to is\\n957\\nHacker News they have something called\\n959\\nshow hn so many YC alumni Dropbox and\\n963\\ngit lab for example and hundreds more\\n965\\nhave launched on Hacker News Robin Hood\\n968\\nis an example of another company that\\n970\\nsuccessfully launched on hn so back in\\n973\\nDecember 2013 they had a really simple\\n975\\nsite and all it said was commission free\\n978\\ntrading stop paying up to ten dollars\\n980\\nper trade\\n981\\nat the time they only had a button that\\n984\\nlet you join a waitlist the waitlist\\n986\\nwould show you how many people were\\n988\\nahead of you in line and how many people\\n989\\nwere behind you in line\\n991\\nso it was a Friday night and they'd been\\n993\\nworking on building this wait list in\\n995\\npreparation for a launch they were\\n997\\nplanning the following week with someone\\n999\\ntotally random posted them on hn and\\n1001\\nboom they got to number one on hn and\\n1004\\nended up getting 10 000 signups the\\n1006\\nfirst day and then over 50 000 over the\\n1009\\nnext week so each Community is different\\n1012\\nthey have different tones audiences\\n1014\\ninterests launched communities you're\\n1017\\ngenuinely genuinely engaged with so be\\n1020\\nauthentic don't get bogged down and too\\n1023\\nmuch marketing and promo language people\\n1026\\nthese days just shut off when they see\\n1028\\nthat do your research and get an\\n1030\\nunderstanding of what will compel\\n1032\\nmembers of that Community to be\\n1033\\ninterested in what you're doing so we\\n1035\\ndon't have time to do a huge Deep dive\\n1038\\ninto these next types of launches but I\\n1040\\nwanted to skim them briefly and share\\n1043\\nsome resources and things that I found\\n1044\\nrecently so in a q a we did with the\\n1047\\nreplit founders a few weeks ago you\\n1049\\nasked amjad and Haya how did you get\\n1051\\nyour first users and they said you just\\n1054\\nhave to be everywhere Hacker News\\n1056\\nTwitter Reddit Etc so I wanted to share\\n1060\\na thread that YC Alum Catherine cross\\n1062\\ntweeted out about building her community\\n1064\\non Tick Tock Anja Health Catherine's\\n1066\\ncompany helps parents freeze their\\n1068\\nbabies umbilical cords and placentas for\\n1070\\nthere's some stuff for their stem cells\\n1072\\nso she wrote This Thread about how she\\n1075\\ncommitted to posting tick tocks to start\\n1077\\nbuilding a community in advance of the\\n1079\\ncompany's launch and in just a month she\\n1082\\nhit 10 000 followers so she shared this\\n1084\\nthread on tips for building a community\\n1087\\non Tick Tock which uh we will link to in\\n1090\\nthe chat there is of course the\\n1092\\npre-order launch and if you are a\\n1095\\nhardware or product or physical product\\n1097\\nyou can do a pre-order campaign on a\\n1099\\nplatform like Kickstarter or Indiegogo\\n1102\\nso preparing uh for a pre-order launch\\n1105\\ncould honestly be a whole presentation\\n1107\\nof its own and honestly there's a little\\n1110\\nbit more skepticism about crowdfunding\\n1112\\nand pre-orders than there was say five\\n1114\\nyears ago so it's worth thinking about\\n1116\\nwhether it's the right thing for your\\n1118\\ncompany but YC Alum ship Bob wrote a\\n1122\\nguide on pre-orders that talks about why\\n1124\\nyou should or should not consider doing\\n1126\\nthis type of campaign there are a lot of\\n1128\\ngreat you know sort of guides that walk\\n1130\\nyou through uh pre-order campaigns and\\n1132\\nhow to prepare for them online as well\\n1133\\nall right and then there's the waitlist\\n1135\\nlaunch we talked about a really good\\n1137\\nexample of that with Robin Hood earlier\\n1139\\nand there are other examples like\\n1141\\nsuperhuman uh that launch successfully\\n1143\\nwith a wait list one note on the\\n1146\\nwaitlist launch the longer you wait to\\n1148\\nlaunch an actual product and the longer\\n1151\\nyou wait to onboard people the harder it\\n1154\\nis to convert people from your waitlist\\n1156\\nso please don't sit on your waitlist for\\n1159\\ntoo long okay so why are we not going to\\n1163\\ntalk about press it all in this talk\\n1165\\nthese days if you were an early stage\\n1167\\ncompany that hasn't raised you know say\\n1169\\na million or more it's going to be\\n1172\\nincredibly hard to land press stories at\\n1174\\nleast in the U.S but that said even if\\n1177\\nyou do land press it's not a silver\\n1179\\nbullet it's not a scalable way to get\\n1182\\nusers it might help you get in front of\\n1184\\nsome early users and investors but as\\n1186\\nyou see press can't be counted on for\\n1189\\nsustained growth it will not get you to\\n1192\\nproduct Market fit so don't spend a ton\\n1195\\nof your time during startup School\\n1196\\nworrying about getting press what I do\\n1198\\nwant to emphasize is while you're in\\n1201\\nstartup school you should start to build\\n1203\\nyour own Community it can be as simple\\n1206\\nas starting an email list of your\\n1207\\nsupporters and figuring out you know how\\n1210\\nto engage them on an ongoing basis and\\n1213\\nyou may be surprised who reads the email\\n1215\\nand shows up to help and in the future\\n1216\\nevery time you release a new product or\\n1219\\na new feature you can use all these\\n1222\\nchannels to launch on them again\\n1224\\nstripe has always been great at engaging\\n1227\\nwith the community each time a new\\n1229\\nproduct launches they blog about it\\n1232\\nthey've the founders get on Hacker News\\n1234\\nand they talk to the hn community they\\n1236\\nspread the word on social media they\\n1238\\npitch press\\n1239\\nstripe they are Masters at launching\\n1242\\nagain and again so to sum up I want you\\n1245\\nto stop thinking about launching as just\\n1248\\none moment in time if you launch and no\\n1251\\none pays attention do what Airbnb did\\n1254\\nand launch again and again\\n1258\\n[Music]\\n\""

      "# Lecture Notes on Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n",
      "\n",
      "Good day, everyone! \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, let's have a chat about the concept of a 'Minimum Viable Product' or 'MVP'. I know we always remind you not to use complex words and here we go...using startup jargon ourselves! \n",
      "\n",
      "Startups often use the term 'MVP'. And we need to break this down and make it simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know when we talk about an MVP, we're talking about something unbelievably easy? Yep, that's right. It's as plain as it can be. Think of it as the very first thing you can offer to those initial users you're trying to reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we do this? It's to test if we can provide some sort of value to them, no matter how small. That's what an MVP is all about. It's a simple approach. Nothing too fancy or jumbled. It's about testing your product with real users and learning from that experience.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# How To Develop Ideas and Solutions for Your Startup\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming up with ideas or finding problems that need solving is a vital part of creating your startup. Here's a little advice on how you can go about it: \n",
      "\n",
      "**Speak to potential users before creating your MVP** - This doesn't mean you have to plunge into a three-year research project, or gain 10 years of industry experience. Sometimes, just having a few conversations with potential users can give you a lot of insight. The closer you are to your user, the better. Ideally, you should be solving a problem that you, yourself, have experience with. It makes it much easier to gauge if your product is really solving the problem it intends to.\n",
      "\n",
      "A frequent question I run into is - \"**How do I find my first users?**\". This question always leaves me a little puzzled. Theoretically, you should already have someone in mind, someone who has the problem your product aims to solve. Your first user could be this individual. If that person happens to be you, all the better! \n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you find yourself creating a product for a \"mysterious\" group of users, whose needs and wants you don't understand... well, it might be time for you to take a step back and reconsider. It's absolutely essential to know and understand your users for your startup to succeed. So get out there and start having those conversations!\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# The Path of a Pre-Launch Startup: Simple Steps to Success\n",
      "\n",
      "Good day, everyone! Today, we're going to chat about the path of a pre-launch startup. I promise you, it's much simpler than it may seem at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's begin with **step one: launch quickly**. This mantra has been a cornerstone for successful start-ups for many years. If you take away anything from our time together today, let it be this: *launch something, even if it's not perfect, and do it as fast as you can*. Trust me, I could talk all day about this concept and it will circle back to this key point.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The second step is to find your first customers**. You don't need to have your whole customer journey plotted out just yet, but you do need someone using your product. Alarmingly, many budding entrepreneurs' journeys end before a single person has ever interacted with their product. Don't let that be you. Any interaction can bring valuable insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, **have conversations with your users**. After launching your bare-bones version of your product, it's crucial to listen to your early users. Some entrepreneurs mistakenly believe that feedback at this stage is pointless because the product isn't fully developed. The truth is, flexibility is key at this stage. You might find that the grand vision you had isn't exactly what your customers need or want. As the saying goes, hold onto the problem and customer tightly, but hold your solution loosely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, **continue to make changes - or 'iterate'**. It’s easy to fall in love with the first thing you build and become blinded by its shortcomings. Resist the temptation to toss it aside and try solving different problems when the going gets tough. Stick with your original user and problem. For example, if you’ve built a screwdriver and it doesn’t work well for a mechanic who needs a screwdriver, don’t start thinking about how it could be a spatula or a brush. Instead, figure out how to make it a better screwdriver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the path to success is all about sticking with your user and their problem, and continually refining your solution until it works impeccably well.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# **Making Your Startup's First Product**\n",
      "\n",
      "The key idea I want you to understand is this: Your startup's first product does not have to be perfect. What it should do, above all else, is to address a real problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "You've likely heard the term 'MVP', which stands for Minimum Viable Product. It's an important concept in the startup world, so let's recall it simply: Your MVP is a very simple version of your product that you can build quickly, often within a few weeks. It can be as basic as a website landing page and a spreadsheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether your MVP involves software or not, the important thing is to start. Make your MVP very simple, focusing on only a few main things your first users really need. You may want to solve every problem for every user right away, but it's usually smarter to start by addressing a few key issues for a small group of first users. Then, you can add more features later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your MVP is your starting point – it's never the end goal. It's just a base for you to grow from. Don't worry if it seems too simple or not as special as you want. What matters is that it solves a problem and allows you to get started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's look at a few examples to help you understand this point better:\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Airbnb**\n",
      "\n",
      "Airbnb is a classic example of a company that started with a very simple MVP. In 2008, their first landing page was quite simple compared to what we see today. How simple? Imagine this: there were no payment options online. If you booked a place on Airbnb, you exchanged money with the host in person! You also couldn't see where the house was located on a map. Despite these shortcomings, they still managed to start their business and iterate on their product.\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Twitch**\n",
      "\n",
      "Another interesting example is Twitch. On its first day, Twitch was known as Justin.tv, and it was a one-channel online reality TV show. The video quality was so low you could hardly see people's faces, let alone any details in their apartment. There were no video games unless the people in the apartment decided to play some. Despite this, today Twitch is a globally popular live streaming platform. \n",
      "\n",
      "These examples show how companies can start small and simple, but with a clear vision and focus on problem-solving, they can grow big and successful. So, when you start your own startup, don't stress over having a perfect product from the start. Just create something that solves a problem, and then keep improving and adding to it over time.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Alright, let's break this down and keep it simple. What's important to notice here is that in the beginning, there weren't any video games around, unless we chose to play video games ourselves in our apartment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now when you think about **Twitch**, it surely has become a lot more complex. We're going to talk about Stripe now. Well, it wasn't called Stripe at the start. They chose a really funky name - \"/dev/payments\". Cool, isn't it? This was the state of Stripe on the first day. No fancy bank deals, just a simple service. I won't get into the details of how they processed payments, but let's just say they did it in a very 'startup' way. One interesting point I want to make is that, if you decided to use Stripe, the founders would actually come to your office to help you integrate it. Isn't that friendly and industrious? A smart way to find and fix problems early, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "The stripped down version of a product that a startup first builds is often known as the **Minimum Viable Product** or **MVP**. The examples I've given you, Twitch and Stripe, these are billion-dollar companies, but their MVPs were really simplistic and bare-bones. Now, I just made up a term called a **'heavy MVP'**. This applies if you're working in fields with lots of rules like insurance or banking, where your MVP will probably have to be a little more sophisticated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does that help paint a clearer picture?\n",

      "# Markdown Lecture Notes: Starting Your Business in a Highly Regulated or Complicated Industry\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello everyone, today let's talk about starting a business in areas that are heavily regulated, like insurance, banking, or even tech-centered fields such as drone technology. It's true **it can be more difficult to get started** in these areas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you might even be involved in very complex fields, maybe you are trying to build rockets or invent new drugs. These types of businesses, often called 'moonshot' projects, are tough. They're not the kind of things you can easily set up in a few weeks. For example, can you imagine trying to bore tunnels into the earth and replace cars with high-speed vehicles in just a couple of weeks? \n",
      "\n",
      "If you find yourself in these situations, **here's a helpful tip:** you can begin with a basic website. This website can simply explain what you do. It's a great starting point, and having a place where people can get information about your business is extremely valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building a simple website like this **can be done in days, not weeks**. In a strange and unexpected way, starting off with a 'heavier' Minimum Viable Product (MVP) like a detailed website could potentially be faster than starting with a 'lean' MVP.\n",

      "# Understanding Launches and Customer Acquisition \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello everyone! Today, we're going to break down a common myth among those looking to kick-start their business. A lot of people see big companies make flashy product launches and think, \"That's what we should do!\" But let's have a hearty chat about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about companies like Facebook. They're well-known, they make headlines, and their launches seem incredibly exciting. Seeing this might make you think, \"That's what success looks like!\" But let's look a bit closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider this - do any of you remember the exact day Google or Facebook, or even Twitter launched? Not really, right? This tells us, launches, in themselves, don't make or break a company. What gives life to your business isn't a one-time, grand launch event. It's something more crucial - your customers!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start using simpler terms. When we say 'launch', let's think of it as the time you start getting customers. And let's call a big, flashy, media-covered event a 'press launch'. Your main focus, especially in the early stages, should be on acquiring customers, not making headlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might learn a lot about your customers through research, but nothing beats giving them a real product. Until they've touched, used, and reviewed what you're offering, you can't confidently say that it meets their needs. This is also a fast check to know if your product does not solve their problems. \n",
      "\n",
      "So here's our main takeaway – spending your time building something for your customers is far more valuable than perfecting a grand pitch deck or working endlessly for a grandiose press launch. Feel free to blur the glamour of press coverage and direct your energy where it matters-the customer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Be eager to learn from your customers. After all, they are the heart of your business!\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Alright, guys, let's dive straight in. Firstly, we're talking about building a **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product), a baby version of your product. It has enough features to satisfy the early users, and you can use the feedback to shape your complete product later on. Our main goal is to build an MVP *fast*. So, here are some friendly tips on how you can achieve that.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Time-box your spec**\n",
      "\n",
      "   What I mean is, draw a time limit for this list of stuff you need to build before you're ready to show your product to the world. Say you decide, \"I want to launch in three weeks.\" Then, the things on your list should only be those you can build within three weeks. This makes everything simpler. It helps you scratch off features you can't build in three weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Write your spec**\n",
      "\n",
      "   This might seem too basic, but trust me, a lot of folks mess this one up. It's very easy to drift from what you're working on because you've not written it down. If you have it in black and white, it helps you stay focused. If you're changing things, you'll at least know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cut your spec**\n",
      "\n",
      "   A week into your work, you might see you've been a little too ambitious with your spec. You can't possibly finish in time. That's okay. Start cutting out stuff that isn't crucial. If everything seems important, start cutting important things too. Remember, the goal is to put *something* out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Don't fall head over heels with your MVP**\n",
      "\n",
      "   It's easy to get very attached to this first version you're creating. But remember, none of those popular products started as we see them now. Your MVP is just step one. Think of it like a paper you wrote in the first grade - you wouldn't frame that, would you? So, don't get too attached; it's all part of a journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that's it for this talk. Always here for any questions you might have. Let's continue creating great things together!\n",
