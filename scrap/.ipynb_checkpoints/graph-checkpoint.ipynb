       "\"0\\nmy name is michael uh i work here at y\\n2\\ncombinator\\n3\\ni helped run the accelerator uh before\\n5\\nthat i did two yc startups\\n7\\num one 2007 and one in 2012.\\n10\\nand today i'm going to talk to you about\\n13\\na\\n13\\nminimum viable product so mvp\\n17\\nwe always yell at founders to not use\\n19\\njargon yet we have this whole set of\\n21\\nstupid startup jargon and mvp is one of\\n23\\nthem\\n24\\num when you think about an mvp you\\n26\\nshould think about something\\n27\\nridiculously simple\\n28\\nthis is the first thing you can give\\n32\\nto the very first set of users you want\\n34\\nto target\\n35\\nin order to see if you can deliver any\\n37\\nvalue at all to them\\n39\\nthat's all it is it's extremely simple\\n42\\ni know you guys had a talk last week\\n44\\nabout how to come up with ideas how to\\n47\\ncome up with problems you want to solve\\n49\\nwhat i will tell you is that it is\\n50\\nhelpful to talk to some users\\n52\\nbefore you decide to build your mvp this\\n54\\ndoesn't mean you have to go into a\\n56\\nthree-year\\n57\\nkind of research situation or you have\\n60\\nto work in industry for 10 years\\n63\\nbut some conversations are helpful it's\\n65\\neven more helpful if you're your own\\n67\\nuser so you can tell whether your\\n69\\nproduct's working for you\\n71\\ni always get this strange question of\\n73\\nhow do i get my first users\\n75\\nwhich always kind of confuses me because\\n77\\ntheoretically you decide\\n78\\nto solve a problem that you know\\n81\\nsomeone has so the way you get your\\n84\\nfirst user as you talk to that person\\n86\\nthat you know has the problem\\n88\\nand if it's you it's even easier so um\\n91\\nif you are building a product for a\\n92\\nmysterious set of users that you have no\\n94\\nidea who they are\\n96\\nquestion that slightly um very slightly\\n101\\nokay so the goal of a pre-launch\\n104\\nstartup um is extremely simple\\n107\\nstep one launch quickly this is\\n110\\nsomething that's been part of the yc\\n112\\nethos from the very beginning and it's\\n114\\nbeen\\n114\\ngreat advice for 10 years and it\\n116\\ncontinues to be great advice\\n118\\num if you can walk away from one thing\\n120\\nfrom this presentation\\n122\\nit's launched something bad quickly\\n125\\nthat's it like literally the rest of\\n127\\nwhat i'm going to say is basically going\\n129\\nto be\\n129\\nre-summarized versions of that same\\n131\\nthing the second thing that an early\\n133\\nstage startup needs to do is get some\\n134\\ninitial customers\\n136\\nget anyone using your product you don't\\n138\\nhave to have a vision of how you get\\n139\\neveryone using it but just\\n141\\nanyone interacting and seeing if they\\n143\\ncan get value out of the product\\n144\\nyou'd be surprised at how many founders\\n147\\njourneys\\n148\\nend before a single user has actually\\n152\\ninteracted with a product they've\\n153\\ncreated\\n154\\num it's very very common so please get\\n157\\npast the step it's extremely important\\n160\\nthe next one is talk to your users any\\n163\\nof them\\n164\\nafter you've launched this mvp and get\\n167\\nfeedback\\n168\\nthis is one that's also extremely common\\n170\\nmistake because most founders in their\\n172\\nheads have a\\n173\\nidea of what they want to build and so\\n176\\nthey kind of have this weird feeling\\n177\\nthat if i haven't built\\n179\\nthe full thing yet getting feedback on\\n181\\nthe shitty initial thing is kind of\\n183\\nuseless of course it's not going to work\\n185\\nit's not the full thing the full things\\n186\\ncan take\\n186\\nthree years 10 million dollars a whole\\n188\\nteam so\\n190\\nfeedback on the little thing is useless\\n192\\nthe reality is that\\n194\\nin some ways the full thing is this\\n196\\nreally awesome idea in your head that\\n198\\nyou should keep in your head\\n199\\nbut it should be very very flexible\\n201\\nbecause it might turn out the full thing\\n203\\nthat you want to build\\n204\\nisn't what your customers want at all so\\n207\\num\\n207\\ni have the saying hold the problem\\n209\\nyou're solving tightly\\n210\\nhold the customer tightly hold the\\n212\\nsolution you're building loosely\\n215\\nand last most important iterate and i\\n217\\nlike to kind of distinguish between\\n219\\niterating and pivoting\\n221\\na lot of founders once they've figured\\n223\\nout how to build something\\n224\\nfall in love with it and so if it\\n226\\ndoesn't work for a certain set of users\\n227\\nthey start thinking\\n229\\nwell i wonder what other problems this\\n231\\nthing can solve\\n232\\nwell you know the screwdriver is not\\n234\\nactually good at screwing in anything\\n236\\nbut i wonder what other problems it\\n238\\ncould solve and they're like oh maybe\\n239\\nyou can use it to cook maybe you can use\\n241\\nit to clean and it's like no\\n243\\nlike the problem was i need to screw\\n245\\nsomething in\\n246\\nthe user was like a mechanic and if your\\n248\\nscrewdriver doesn't\\n249\\nhelp the mechanic solve the problem keep\\n251\\nthe mechanic\\n252\\nkeep the problem i need to screw\\n254\\nsomething in fix the screwdriver\\n256\\nlike that's the thing that's broken\\n259\\nright the broken thing is not the\\n260\\nmechanic and it's not the fact that they\\n262\\nneed to screw something in\\n263\\nso iterate continue improving on your\\n267\\nsolution\\n268\\nuntil it actually solves a problem in\\n270\\nmost\\n271\\ncases most people should be building a\\n273\\nvery lean\\n274\\nmvp so by that we mean\\n277\\num you should be able to build it fast\\n280\\nin weeks not months\\n282\\nthis can either involve software or\\n284\\nhonestly we see startups just start with\\n286\\na landing page and a spreadsheet but\\n290\\nmost startups can start very very fast\\n293\\nsecond extremely limited functionality\\n297\\nyou need to condense down what your user\\n299\\nneeds what your initial user needs\\n301\\nto a very simple set of things a lot of\\n303\\ntimes founders want to address\\n305\\nall of their users problems and all of\\n307\\ntheir potential users when in reality\\n310\\nthey should just focus on a small set of\\n312\\ninitial users\\n313\\nand their highest order problems and\\n316\\nthen ignore the rest until later\\n319\\nyou should have a vision of everyone you\\n321\\nshould have an mvp\\n323\\nvery small all this is is a base to\\n325\\niterate from\\n326\\nthat's it it's just a starting point um\\n329\\nit doesn't\\n329\\nit's not special in any way you just\\n331\\nhave to start\\n333\\nand so please make sure you don't feel\\n336\\nlike your mvp is too special\\n338\\nokay uh here is a classic example uh\\n341\\nthis is\\n342\\none of airbnb's first landing pages uh\\n345\\nin 2008\\n348\\ni believe one of the things that you\\n350\\nmight be interested in about\\n352\\nin airbnb's first product is that there\\n354\\nwere no payments\\n356\\nwhen you found a place to stay on airbnb\\n358\\nyou had to exchange\\n359\\nmoney with the host in person needless\\n362\\nto say that was\\n363\\na pretty big problem but they\\n366\\nstarted without payments\\n368\\nno map view you know how when you search\\n369\\nairbnb you can see where the house is in\\n372\\nthe city\\n372\\nyou don't have that sorry um and\\n375\\nthe person writing all the code nate was\\n377\\nworking part-time\\n379\\nokay so everyone tells these kind of\\n381\\nmagical stories about how everything was\\n383\\nperfect from the beginning\\n384\\nairbnb not perfect from the beginning\\n388\\nuh the next one twitch this was what\\n391\\ntwitch\\n391\\nlooked like day one not very familiar\\n394\\nwell maybe a little familiar there's\\n396\\nsome video there and there's some chat\\n397\\nthere\\n398\\nother than that nothing else uh twitch\\n401\\nlaunched as\\n402\\njustin tv which was a online reality tv\\n405\\nshow\\n406\\nthere was only one channel justin you\\n409\\nhad to follow his life if you didn't\\n410\\nlike his life you had to leave the\\n411\\nwebsite that's all there was\\n414\\nthe video was extremely low resolution\\n418\\nit was funny a founder asked me back in\\n420\\nthe day like oh like wasn't it weird you\\n422\\nguys had video in your apartment weren't\\n423\\nthere all these like secret documents\\n425\\nand things that like people would be\\n426\\nable to see and it was like\\n427\\nyou could barely recognize our faces let\\n429\\nalone\\n431\\ndocuments that we had um and most\\n433\\nimportantly there were no video games\\n435\\nno video games except if we decided to\\n437\\nplay video games in our apartment like\\n439\\nthat was the only time video games ever\\n440\\nappeared\\n441\\nand so let me just say you can do that\\n443\\nquickly\\n444\\nwhen you think about twitch it's much\\n446\\nmore complex now\\n448\\nlast stripe which wasn't stripe it was\\n450\\ncalled slash dev\\n451\\npayments because why not like let's make\\n453\\na name that's really easy to remember\\n455\\num this was stripe day one\\n459\\nno bank deals i won't tell you exactly\\n462\\nhow they process payments but\\n464\\nuh it was in a very startupy way\\n468\\nalmost no features and even cooler if\\n471\\nyou wanted to use stripe the stripe\\n472\\nfounders would come to your office and\\n474\\nintegrate it for you\\n476\\nhow nice is that um half because\\n479\\nthey were just desperate to get anyone\\n480\\nto use it and half because it was a\\n482\\ngreat way to find bugs before the users\\n483\\nfound bugs uh integrate yourself\\n486\\nso these are just three examples of\\n489\\nextremely simple extremely fast to build\\n492\\nmvps\\n494\\nall of these are billion dollar\\n496\\ncompanies and they all started with\\n497\\nsomething that most people would say\\n499\\nis pretty shitty in very few cases you\\n503\\nhave to build\\n504\\na heavy mvp i just invented that term\\n507\\nheavy mvp when i made this presentation\\n508\\ntwo days ago so uh\\n510\\nyou know maybe it becomes a thing if\\n511\\nyou're in an industry with significant\\n513\\nregulation like insurance or banking\\n516\\num sometimes drones although sometimes\\n519\\nnot um\\n521\\nit's hard to launch it's it's harder to\\n524\\nlaunch you have to pass through a bunch\\n525\\nof regulatory bodies first\\n527\\nif you're doing hard tech if you're\\n528\\nbuilding rockets it is hard to build a\\n531\\nrocket in a couple weeks\\n533\\nbiotech it is hard to invent a cancer\\n535\\ndrug in a couple weeks\\n537\\nmoonshots well fill in all the other\\n538\\nblanks it's hard to\\n540\\nbore tunnels in the earth and have\\n542\\nextremely fast vehicles that replace\\n544\\ncars in a couple weeks\\n546\\nso if you're in that situation\\n549\\num please remember that your mvp can\\n552\\nstart\\n553\\nwith a simple simple website that\\n556\\nexplains what you do\\n558\\num it's helpful when you talk to people\\n560\\ninteract with people that they\\n562\\ncan refer back to something so that can\\n564\\nbe your start and you can build that\\n566\\nsimple website in days not weeks so\\n568\\nmany ways maybe your heavy mvps are\\n570\\nfaster than your lean mbps in some weird\\n572\\nstrange way\\n574\\nnow i want to talk about launching for a\\n576\\nsecond because a lot of founders have\\n577\\nthis misconception about launching\\n579\\num they see big companies launch stuff\\n582\\nand they assume that's what startups do\\n583\\nin fact they see companies they kind of\\n584\\nthink about like startups\\n586\\nfacebook's not really a startup anymore\\n588\\nbut they see them getting a lot of press\\n590\\nand getting a lot of buzz and yadda\\n592\\nyadda and they have in their head that\\n593\\nthat's what a successful company\\n595\\nlooks like when they launch well let me\\n597\\nask you\\n598\\nthis question um how many here remember\\n601\\nthe day that google launched\\n604\\nno how about facebook\\n607\\num okay how about twitter no\\n611\\ngreat so it turns out that launches\\n614\\naren't that special at all\\n616\\nokay so if you have this magical idea of\\n618\\nyour magical launch you want to do\\n620\\nthrow it away it's not that special the\\n622\\nnumber one thing that's really important\\n625\\nis to get some customers so to make\\n628\\npeople feel better\\n629\\nlet's use different terms how about\\n631\\nlaunch is when you get any customers\\n633\\nand how about like press launch press\\n636\\nlaunch really impressive\\n637\\nis when like people write about things\\n639\\nand it's all exciting and you get all\\n640\\nthis buzz\\n641\\nlet's push the press launch off and\\n643\\nlet's push the get\\n644\\nany customers launch really really soon\\n648\\nthat's our goal here it's a lot\\n651\\nharder to learn from your customers when\\n653\\nthey don't have a product they can play\\n655\\nwith\\n656\\nyou know you can talk to your customer\\n657\\nall day but you have no idea whether the\\n659\\nthing you want to build can solve their\\n660\\nproblem\\n661\\nif you put the thing in front of them\\n663\\nand it doesn't solve their problem\\n664\\nyou know right away and so all the\\n667\\nresearch in the world is good but until\\n669\\nyou can put something in front of people\\n670\\nyou have no freaking idea whether it's\\n672\\ngoing to work\\n674\\nso spending all that time on a pitch\\n675\\ndeck is not as valuable as spending your\\n678\\ntime building\\n679\\nanything that you can give to a customer\\n682\\nfinally some hacks for building an mvp\\n685\\nextremely quickly\\n687\\nfirst time box your spec so your spec is\\n689\\nthe list of stuff you need to build\\n690\\nbefore you launch\\n692\\ntime box it say okay what happens if i\\n695\\nwant to launch in three weeks\\n697\\nokay well the only things that could be\\n699\\non my spec are things i can build in\\n700\\nthree weeks that makes your life a lot\\n702\\nsimpler it allows you to remove all the\\n704\\nfeatures you can't build in three weeks\\n707\\nsecond write your spec this seems really\\n710\\nstraightforward but most people\\n712\\nthis one up\\n713\\nit's really easy to change what you're\\n715\\nworking on before you ever launch it\\n717\\nbecause you never write it down you\\n719\\nstart working on something\\n721\\nyou talk to a user they say oh i would\\n723\\nnever use that or god forbid you talk to\\n724\\nan investor and they say oh that could\\n726\\nnever be a company because\\n727\\ninvestors know everything and so you\\n729\\ndecide to change what you're working on\\n730\\nand because you never wrote it down you\\n732\\ndon't even really realize you're\\n733\\nchanging it\\n734\\nand so your three week plan turns into a\\n735\\nthree month plan\\n737\\nif you write down at least you can\\n738\\nbe honest with yourself\\n740\\nthat you're changing your spec all the\\n741\\ntime\\n743\\nthe next one is cut your spec a week\\n746\\ninto your kind of three week sprint\\n748\\nyou probably realize that you added too\\n750\\nmany things to your spec and you're not\\n751\\ngonna make your deadline\\n752\\nthat's okay just cut the stuff that\\n755\\nclearly isn't important\\n758\\nand if there's no non-important things\\n759\\nstart cutting important things\\n762\\nmost of the goal here is just to get\\n764\\nanything out in the world\\n766\\nonce you get anything out in the world\\n767\\nthe momentum to keep anything going\\n770\\nis extremely strong once you have any\\n772\\nonce you if you don't have anything out\\n773\\nin the world\\n774\\nit's very easy to just delay delay delay\\n776\\ndelay\\n777\\nand then last don't fall in love with\\n778\\nyour mvp so many people\\n781\\nfall in love with the vision in their\\n783\\nhead and none of the products i showed\\n786\\nyou before was the initial vision\\n788\\nof what it ended up being so please\\n791\\ndon't\\n791\\nfall in love with your mvp um it's just\\n795\\nstep one in a journey you wouldn't fall\\n798\\nin love with a paper you wrote in the\\n799\\nfirst grade\\n800\\nand like that's like the level of impact\\n802\\noften your mvp\\n804\\nhas all right it was great talking to\\n806\\nall of you thank you very much\\n829\\nyou\\n\""

      "# How to Understand Your Startup Customers and Build an MVP\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello everyone, today let's break down how to understand your customers and use that understanding to build your Minimum Viable Product or MVP (The first simple version of your product). This is different from what you may think. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many people wrongly imagine that creating startups is something that busy money people dream up on a lazy Sunday, or that software folks crank out during a late-night coding marathon. If that's your idea, you're in for a surprise. It's not like that at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now you might recall a scene from the movie \"The Social Network\". It's a good film, but let me tell you, it gets a lot wrong about how a real startup like Facebook began. \n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, let me introduce you to Brian Chesky. He's the guy who co-started Airbnb. See him in this photo? On his left is Amal, the very first Airbnb guest. They hang out together in San Francisco for a weekend. \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you see a difference between this real-life photo and that movie scene? You've got it! This photo from real life shows a two-way chat with a genuine customer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smart starters of a business talk with future customers even before there's a product available. To be honest, the top achievers in the business field keep learning from their users throughout their company's life. But, of course, this comes after you've worked out who your real users are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should you learn from your customers, you ask? They're the only ones who really keep you honest. As the ones actually giving you money, they have the strongest stake in your offering. If there's anyone who'll tell you the real story, it's them. \n",
      "\n",
      "So in short, my friends, your customers are your chief guides in setting up and running your startup. Never forget that. Got it? Good.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# A Lesson in User Engagement through the Airbnb Story\n",
      "\n",
      "The most successful brands are those that openly engage with their users, truly understanding their needs and motivations. One such example comes from **Airbnb** and its CEO, *Brian Chesky*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take a stroll down memory lane to 2010. Picture this: *Brian Chesky*, Airbnb's CEO, deciding to live in 50 different Airbnb homes over the span of a few months. You're probably thinking, \"Why put himself through all that trouble?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "God is in the details, folks, and many missed the deep purpose behind this move. It might have seemed like a wild idea, but let me tell you, it was an inspired one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brian's living experiment provided him the golden opportunity to directly engage with 50 different hosts, one-on-one on each day of his journey. Think about it - what could be a more real, direct source of honest feedback than that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Without Airbnb hosts, the platform wouldn't be what it is today. So, what Brian and his co-founders Joe and Nate did was to deeply engage with and understand their hosts. To this day, Brian and Joe still receive calls from hosts on their private numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "They didn't hide behind faceless \"info\" or \"do not reply\" emails - they gave their direct contact details to hosts. For a time, this was considered a rather wild idea. While most founders turned their focus on scalable growth channels like Google Ads, they remained front and centre with their customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, not many leaders follow this approach today. Often hiding behind anonymous email addresses, they lose personal connection with their users. Skeptical? Look for 'do not reply' emails in your inbox and see how many there are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being accessible to your users is not just a nice-to-do, but rather, it's a must-do. Especially in the startup world, understanding and engaging with your users can be the difference between a brand's success and its failure. Let's learn, shall we, from Airbnb's playbook.\n",

      "## Exploring Who to Talk To \n",
      "\n",
      "As you get your startup going, it's important to **understand your audience**. This could be talking to your customers, your network, or even your co-workers. Here are two main groups you should consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "-   **Your personal network**: It might seem simple, but people who know you are more likely to answer your questions. Just remember, they might not be fully honest because they might not want to hurt your feelings. Don't let the fear of rejection stop you from reaching out to them!\n",
      "\n",
      "-   **Your co-workers or former colleagues**: These are great people to talk to because they already understand your work and might be potential users of your product, particularly if you're building software for startups. They may also bring to you potential users outside of your personal or professional circles. \n",
      "\n",
      "How can you find these early users? Many startup founders commonly use LinkedIn, online forums, chat communities like Slack or Discord, or sometimes even in-person events!\n",
      "\n",
      "## Building a Mock Startup\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's try to understand the whole process by creating a **mock startup**. This isn't a real company, but let's pretend as though it is. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our startup's goal is to help companies reduce their carbon emissions. Our plan is simple: \n",
      "\n",

      "# Customer Interviews: A Brief Guide\n",
      "Hello class, today we're going to chat about how to interview potential customers for your startup. It might feel new, but don't worry, with a few tips, you'll be able to master it in no time.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, **do these interviews face-to-face**, over video calls, or phone calls. You can learn a lot more in a 5-minute video talk than from many written answers. Also, remember to **make your guest feel at ease**. They'll be sharing insights that maybe no one has asked them before, so it's crucial they trust you and feel comfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you ready for the most, most important thing? Here it is: **Keep your idea for later, maybe at the end of the call, or maybe not at all**. Talking about it too soon might lead them to give answers that they think you want to hear. In this interview, your job is to listen, not talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "One good way to get people to talk about their problems is to ask follow-up questions that don't have a 'yes' or 'no' answer. For example, \"Tell me about that.\" And if you're not recording the interview, **try to take as many notes as you can.**\n",
      "\n",
      "For better understanding, let’s dive into a pretend chat I have with a potential customer for my imaginary carbon emission company.\n",
      ">“Hi, when we worked together at Airbnb, did your company care about carbon emissions? … What did you do with the reports? … Why didn’t you act on them? … Why is it important for your business to track emissions?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the chat, I steer clear of suggesting any products or solutions. I only ask questions to get to know the problem better. That's how you should approach it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few questions you can use:\n",
      "1. \"Tell me how you do _X_ today.\" (With _X_ being the problem or task you’re trying to solve.)\n",
      "2. \"What's the hardest part of doing _X_?\"\n",
      "3. \"Why is it hard?\"\n",
      "4. \"How often do you do _X_?\"\n",
      "5. \"Why is it important for your business to do _X_?\" (Understanding the motivation behind this is very important.)\n",
      "6. \"What ways do you use to solve this problem now?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, **try to understand their behavior, not just what they're saying but what they're doing**. Changing behavior is hard, so knowing what they do now is essential. If you can see them do the task in real-time during the interview, that's perfect!\n",
      "\n",
      "To wrap up, asking the right questions helps us get the right information we need to understand our potential customers better. The more we know, the better we can shape our business to meet their needs. Let's keep practicing, and remember, listening is key.\n",

      "**How to Ask Effective Questions**\n",
      "\n",
      "When starting a business, asking questions to the right people can be very important. But it's not always easy to change someone's behavior, so it'll be helpful if you know the right way to ask questions. Learn to ask follow-up questions too because it can be hard to get all the information you need from just one question.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get more information, here are some follow-up questions you might use: 'What do you mean by that?', 'Can you tell me more about that?', or 'Why is that important to you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are also types of questions you hould avoid asking. These ones can sometimes put the conversation off-track:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **'Will you use our product?'** - People might say yes, but it may not mean anything to you. They might just be trying to be nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **'Which features would make Product X better?'** - Remember, it's your job to figure out what features would solve their problems, not theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Yes/no questions** - These types of questions don't really add a lot to the conversation. They don't provide you with concrete examples or real, useful information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **'How would a better Product X look to you?'** - Most people you'll be talking to are not product developers, software engineers, designers, etc. That's not their job. Their job is to do something else and your job is to understand what is difficult about their job.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Double-barreled questions** - Asking two questions at once can confuse people and mix up their answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember not to be too eager to get all the answers at once. Take one step at a time and build a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve.\n",

      "# Lecture: Understanding User Problems Over Features\n",
      "\n",
      "Good day everyone! Today, we're going to discuss listening to your users during interviews. You may be buzzing to get quick answers, it might seem the easy thing to do, but we need to step back a little. An important point I want to underline is a common mistake during customer talks: focusing more on the features of your product instead of the issues your users face. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's human nature to do this. As the problem solver at heart, you're already trying to find solutions to these issues. But here's the crucial thing: interviews are there to get to the heart of what troubles users, rather than brainstorm solutions. We'll save problem-solving for another time. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see, users generally spot good problems but might not be the best at coming up with solutions. I want to share two real world examples with you to illustrate this point. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take the early days of Gmail. Many users asked Paul Buchheit, Gmail's creator, for a chance to see both their inbox and the actual email message all in one go. You might wonder why. The simple reason was that Gmail was a bit of a slowpoke back then, making people wait to load each email. So, they wanted to see everything at once to save time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, Airbnb. In its initial phase, many guests wanted the phone numbers of their hosts. But why, you might ask. Well, it turned out that guests were not fully sure they could trust Airbnb. They felt better getting to know their host before booking a stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's another important note to remember: users will generally not say no to extra features. If you offer a bundle of features, they will most likely say yes to all of them. However, remember that you're the captain of this ship. You are responsible for what goes into your product and it's up to you to figure out what's essential. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, when talking to users, lean towards understanding their problems instead of displaying your product features. This will help you make well-informed decisions for your product. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# Let's Discuss the Next Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you've just completed your first few user interviews. You've got about five or ten under your belt, and you've been dutifully documenting everything in the process. What do you do next? Let's break it down into simple steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Gather Your Notes:** The first thing you want to do is to make sure you've captured notes from every single interview. You can use things like sticky notes or a simple computer program to keep everything organized.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sort Out Your Learning:** You can group what you've learned into different piles. Each pile might reflect a different problem that you've identified. The goal here is to find out which problem is the most important one that needs solving.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Write Down Your Conclusions:** What have you learned from these interviews? Write it all down. This will help you digest everything and make sense of all the information you've gathered.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Form a Hypothesis:** Using all this information you've gathered, think about what the solution to the problem might be. Don't make this too complicated, keep it simple. You're just making an educated guess at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Start Building Your MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Using your hypothesis, start building your MVP as quickly as you can. You want to test this MVP with the information you've gathered. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the goal here isn't to overthink the process or get buried in details. You want to get going on your MVP as quickly as possible, but you also want to make sure you're informed by the user interviews you've conducted. Happy building!\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# A Simple Guide on Deciding, Testing, and Valuing Your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n",
      "\n",
      "So, you're ready to make your MVP, or **the simplest form of your product** that you'll show to users. That's great! However, it's vital to ensure that the issue you're trying to fix is really worth fixing. In other words, are people ready to pay for a solution to the problem? Is the problem so important that solving it is valuable? With this, let me take you through three simple ways to figure this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Point 1: Check If There Is Money to Be Made\n",
      "The first thing you need to do is see if people are already spending money on solutions to the problem. For example, let's say your product can make carbon emissions reports. Are the folks who currently do this job getting paid well? If they are, that's great news! This could mean your solution might also be valued.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Point 2: Know Your Competitors\n",
      "Next, find out if people are already happy with solutions they have. This might sound basic, but it's crucial. Simple tools like Excel or Google spreadsheets can be big competition to many new businesses. If you want to get people to leave these tools, your product needs to be much, much better. No one would want to pay a lot of money for something that can be done almost the same way in Google spreadsheet or Excel.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Point 3: Understand If Your Product is Easy to Sell \n",
      "Finally, think about how easy or hard it is to sell to your audience. In my experience, selling to groups like plumbers or contractors can be quite hard. They don't often change their tools or software. However, startups are always eager to try new things. Even if your product does solve a problem, it's important to think if it's going to be easy to sell it to your audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, once you have the prototype of your MVP ready, you can start testing and improving it. Remember, the best product is one that not only solves a problem but also is wanted by the customer. This is the key to success in the startup world.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "# Selling to Your Audience: A Simple Guide to Testing Your Startup MVP\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi everyone! Today, let's talk about how to sell your product to your target audience. Guess what? You don't have to wait for a finished product to start pitching your idea! A *Minimum Viable Product* or **MVP** can be just a simple example of what the finished product might look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Using a Design Prototype\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't have to get technical right away. Even something as basic as a design prototype – created in a tool like *Envision* or something similar - can give your potential customers an idea of what the final product will look like. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember how we did things at *MB*? We used the easiest way - we would simply walk downstairs in our office, find someone who was waiting for a coffee or an interview, and show them the newest version of our planned app.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Handling the Prototype: The Key Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "Here you need to focus on the most critical part. **Don't tell** them what to do with the prototype. Let them explore. Give them a gentle push, perhaps a basic task, something like \"try to book a room on Airbnb\" or \"search for dates\", but don't guide them on how to achieve it step by step. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, if this was a real product, you wouldn't be standing next to them to assist, would you?\n",
      "\n",
      "## Making the Most of User Experience\n",
      "\n",
      "A neat trick to get the most of  this experience? Ask them to voice their thoughts while they use the prototype. Ask them to explain what they're thinking at each step, which words they understand, which they don't, or what they believe a specific screen or feature is meant for.\n",
      "\n",
      "By doing this, you get to understand your potential users better and refine your product to suit their needs and expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "And that's it! Testing your MVP this way can bring you closer to a product that really meets the needs of your target audience. Do remember, it may take several rounds and iterations, but with each step, you will be moving closer to a successful product. I hope this has been helpful. Happy experimenting!\n",

      "\n",
      "Every great startup starts with an idea. But how do you know if this idea will work? How do you make sure that it will meet people's needs? The key to throwing light on these questions is through interviews or `user testing sessions`.\n",
      "\n",
      "After you have gathered a lot of useful opinions and ideas through these interviews, it's wise to keep your fellow members involved in your journey. Many successful startups do this in a very clever way, by inviting their users to join private groups, often on platforms like `Slack` or `WhatsApp`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, isn't it a lovely feeling to be part of something special? You bet it is! More so if this 'something special' is a product that could change the world in time to come. When inviting people into these groups, ensure to make them feel unique, to make them feel part of your 'future-changer' product journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "As your product grows and changes, keep members of these groups in the loop. Show them your work, talk to them about the progress, make them feel special, like they are the first ones to see this. This kind of openness not only makes them feel connected, but it also builds trust, as they can see you're acting on their feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that some people enjoy meeting others with similar thoughts. Creating these spaces lets them connect, which can be a rare opportunity for many. It's you who can make this happen!\n",
