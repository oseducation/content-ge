       "\"foreign\\n[Music]\\nmy name is Gustav and I work here at y\\ncombinator as a group partner I've been\\nhere since 2017. before YC I was a\\npractically to Airbnb and actually a YC\\nfounder back in 2007. today I'm going to\\ntalk about how to talk to your users and\\nyour future customers here's what I plan\\nto cover today why the best Founders\\ntalk to the users throughout the\\nlifetime of the company two how to find\\nyour users and how to talk to them three\\nwhat questions to ask them and what not\\nto ask them and four how to turn your\\nconclusions into an MVP most people in\\nthe world have the idea on how new\\nstartups to form completely wrong they\\nthink ideas of new products is something\\nthe financials come up with on a lazy\\nSunday or a late night coding session\\nyou probably know it doesn't work this\\nway this scene as you can see here here\\nis a scene from The Social Network movie\\nit's a great movie but they got a lot of\\nthings wrong on how Facebook actually\\ngot started this is Brian chesky Brian\\nis the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb on\\nthe left side of the photo is Amal Amal\\nwas the very first guest on Airbnb they\\nactually spent a weekend together in San\\nFrancisco when they'd be kind of watched\\nyou notice the difference between this\\nphoto and the previous photo well this\\nphoto actually is a real photo it\\nincludes a two-way conversation with a\\nreal customer great Founders talk to\\nFuture customers before they even have a\\nproduct in fact the very best Founders\\nin the world learn directly from their\\nusers throughout the life of their\\ncompany but that's again if you have\\ncorrectly identified who your users are\\nyou should learn from them throughout\\nthe lifetime of your company why you\\nmight ask\\nusers and customers will keep you honest\\nthey are the only stakeholders actually\\npaying you anything if anyone will tell\\nyou the truth it will be them so my talk\\ntoday is about how to do this well so\\nlet's talk about another m b story in\\n2010 um and I remember this uh myself\\nBrian chesky the CEO of Airbnb he'll\\ndecide to launch an experiment he was\\ngoing to give up his apartment and live\\nin 50 different airbnbs over the next\\ncouple of months you might ask yourself\\nwhy would anyone do that so much hassle\\nmost people read the articles about this\\nexperiment because he did announce it\\nthey missed a point\\num I personally remember this being kind\\nof crazy by doing this Brian will\\nliterally get a chance to talk to every\\none of these 50 hosts each single day on\\nthis trip and one incredible source of\\nhonest feedback on your product without\\nthe Airbnb hosts MB would not exist\\nexist today what Brian Joe and Nate did\\nso early is deeply understand the\\nmotivations\\num and the feedback from their hosts\\nstill today Brian and Joe gets calls\\nfrom hosts on their personal cell phone\\nnumbers I remember them telling me that\\nthat on their first day of adworks at\\nAirbnb\\nwhy do they do that well it's the number\\nthat they put on the website and share\\nwith all of their hosts early on they\\nweren't hiding behind Anonymous email\\nthey wanted to hear from the customers\\nat the time this seemed almost radical\\nmost Founders would spend their time in\\nfront of the computers trying to find\\nscalable growth channels like Google ads\\nunfortunately most Founders still don't\\nbuild personal connections with their\\nusers today behind behind info at emails\\nor don't do not reply emails you don't\\nbelieve me you should just do a search\\nin your email for do not reply at and\\nsee how many people don't want to talk\\nto their customers so let's start by\\ntrying to figure out who I should talk\\nto it's always easy to interview people\\nthat you know or people who are on your\\nnetwork they're simply the most likely\\nto respond but perhaps can be less\\nhonest in their answers to not offend\\nyou don't be afraid of reaching out to\\nthem and don't be afraid of rejection\\nthe second group here is co-workers or\\nformer co-workers they can be a really\\ngreat source they might know the topic\\nreally well and if you're building\\nsoftware for startups you can easily and\\neasily navigate yourself to someone\\nwho's a potential User it's also very\\ncommon that the early users you speak to\\nare outside of your personal circuits or\\nyour co-workers circles when asking YC\\nFounders how they found their early\\nusers some of the most common answers\\nwere LinkedIn red forms slack or Discord\\ncommunities and sometimes in-person\\nevents so to illustrate this process\\num a little better I'm going to start a\\nnew mock startup this is not a real\\ncompany I'm just making it up but I'm\\ngoing to go through the process as I\\nwould have if this was a real company\\nand first I want to understand if the\\nproblem is real my hypothesis that I\\nhave here or kind of like the idea space\\nthat we sometimes call as NYC is that\\ncompanies want to reduce their carbon\\nemissions but for whatever reasons don't\\ndo that so my plan is very simple I want\\nto first interview some potential\\ncustomers to learn about the problems\\nand motivations around carbon emissions\\nand three try to understand what an MVP\\nwill look like MVP is a minimal viable\\nproduct to do this research I plan to\\nstart by reaching out to Founders CEOs\\nCFOs at startups or bigger companies I'm\\nalso going to be shocked to people on\\nLinkedIn that have titles like\\ncarbon or climate or sustainability\\nbasically Wars that gives me hint that\\nthey might be relevant people to talk to\\nso what am I looking to learn well first\\nI'm trying to understand do the company\\nthat they work for care about their\\ncarbon emissions and two why do they\\ncare and why do they not care if they\\ndon't care and three who in that company\\nmight be the one who cares the most\\nabout this uh and why all right so so\\nhere are two examples of Outreach\\nmessages so the first one is a LinkedIn\\nmessage to a CFO who I used to work with\\nat Airbnb the message will go something\\nlike this first I introduce myself I\\nmentioned something about our time at\\nAirbnb then I say I'm starting a new\\nproject briefly describe it but not too\\nmuch in detail and I just asked for 20\\nminute phone call or video call that's\\nit and here's another example of a\\nmessage to someone I don't know it's\\nalso on LinkedIn to the same group that\\nI mentioned earlier it's similar but\\ngeared towards people I don't know so\\nthe message will and the tone will be a\\nlittle bit different all right so once I\\nget on the phone or once again on the\\nvideo call let's talk about uh how to\\nactually interview potential customers\\nso first you want to make sure that\\nthese interviews are over video calls\\nphone calls or in person you can learn a\\nlot more from a five minute video\\ninterview than 500 or 5 000 sugar\\nresponses\\nsecondly you want to build some Report\\nwith interviewee they're going to give\\nyou answers to questions that maybe no\\none have asked them before so you need\\nto make sure that they can trust you and\\nfeel comfortable in this situation next\\nuh the most important thing here the\\nmost most important thing here is to not\\nintroduce your idea until maybe at the\\nend of the call or maybe not at all\\ndoing this too early can bias them in\\ntheir answers your role here in this\\ninterview is to listen not to talk\\nthere are some great techniques to get\\npeople to open up and talk about their\\nproblems and one good one is to ask\\nfollow-up questions that are open-ended\\nfor example tell me about that if you're\\nnot recording the interview you should\\nat least take notes as much as you can\\nyou need to translate the recordings to\\nnotes anyway so you might as well take\\nnotes in the in the actual interview I'm\\ngoing to play an example video here on\\nuh how a potential customer for my\\ncarbon emission company and how that\\nconversation will go like Hi how are you\\num it's been a long time since we worked\\ntogether Airbnb\\nyeah great to see you\\nso I don't know if I told her this but\\nI'm thinking about starting another\\ncompany and I have a couple questions I\\nwanted to ask you about this era that\\nI'm interested in uh does your company\\nmontevue Inc do you care about your\\ncarbon emissions\\nwe do actually care and we use a\\nconsultant who creates these PDF reports\\nonce a year\\ninteresting uh what do you do with a\\nreport\\nI mean right now I don't think we really\\ntake much action on it unfortunately\\nwell why not\\nit's just really hard to know what to do\\nwith the information\\num the information is really dense and\\num uses words we don't really understand\\ntell me more about that\\nwell we hired this consultant\\num they asked us to fill out this word\\ndoc with information but most of the\\ndata that goes into it uh seems\\ninaccurate and I just feel like we need\\nanother expert to figure out what to do\\nwith the data\\ngot it got it\\num but why is it important for your\\ncompany at all to track carbon emission\\nwell our\\num and I think there's some regulations\\ncoming up too\\nyou notice here how I never introduced a\\nproduct or a solution I only ask\\nquestions to learn about the problem\\nthat Amy's having I don't even say what\\nI'm going to build\\nthat's how you want to do it here are\\nsome very specific questions that you\\ncan use in your interviews one tell me\\nhow you do X today by X of course I'm\\nreferring to a specific problem a task\\nor goal that you are trying to solve two\\nwhat is the hardest thing you are doing\\nabout x three why is it hard four how\\noften do you have to do x five why is it\\nimportant for your company to do X make\\nsure you dive deep into this question\\nlike understanding that motivation is\\ngoing to be critical here and six what\\ndo you do to solve this problem for\\nyourself today it's really important to\\nunderstand what they're doing\\nnow if you can watch them do this that's\\neven better if they can screen share\\nduring the video call or show you their\\nlaptop as you're doing the interview and\\nshow you how they actually get the PDF\\nreport what they do with it\\num how it looks like\\nthat's the ideal State you want to\\ndeeply understand their behavior not\\njust what they're saying but what\\nthey're doing because changing the\\nbehavior will be hard you can also ask\\nfollow-up questions and please learn how\\nto make use of these ones it's very hard\\nto get someone to say everything in just\\none answer to one question get\\ncomfortable with asking questions like\\nwhat do you mean by that or can you tell\\nme more about that or why is that\\nimportant to you here are some questions\\nthat you should not ask like there are\\nways you can kind of derail this\\ninterview will you use our product\\nthey're probably going to say yes but\\nthey're not going to mean anything to\\nyou the answer\\ntwo which features would make product X\\nbetter\\nremember their job is to tell you about\\nthe problem your job is to think about\\nwhat features to solve that problem so\\nasking them about your job isn't really\\ngoing to help you yes and no questions\\nit's not really that helpful for you you\\nwant them to explain and give you as\\nmany concrete and real examples as\\npossible so just simply asking yes no\\nquestions is not ideal here and four\\num how would would a better product X\\nlook like to you how would a better\\nCarbon emission counting software look\\nlike to you uh many of the people aren't\\nproduct developers they're not software\\nEngineers they're not designers they're\\nnot product managers this is not their\\njob their job is to do a different job\\nand you are the one trying to understand\\nwhat is the challenging part about their\\njob\\nand finally\\num asking two questions at the same time\\nthat's going to confuse them it's going\\nto confuse your answers so this is when\\nyou're eager to get um get answers it's\\nvery easy to do this this thing but try\\nto avoid it but I want to highlight one\\nof the things I mentioned here there's\\none big danger during interviews and\\nthat is to focus on features instead of\\nproblems\\nit's very natural for you to do that\\nyour bra your brain is thinking through\\nall the ways you're going to solve this\\nproblem\\nbut really what you're here for during\\nthis interview is to deeply understand\\nthe problems not actually come up with\\nSolutions that's for for us for a\\nseparate event so users generally have\\ngood problems but also generally bad\\nSolutions so I'll give you two specific\\nexamples so early days of Gmail users\\nwere asking\\num Paul Buchheit the founder of Gmail to\\nview both the Inbox and the actual email\\nthat they were reading on the same\\nscreen now why would they ask for that\\nwell the reason was simply that Gmail is\\ntoo slow and people did not want to wait\\nto load each of the emails in the inbox\\nthey want to see everything at the same\\ntime similarly in early Airbnb a lot of\\nguests want to have the phone numbers of\\nthe host so they can call them we're\\nlike why do you need that it just turned\\nout that they didn't fully trust the\\nplatform like we had not displayed\\nenough trust in Airbnb so they needed to\\nfeel comfortable uh with getting to know\\nthe host before it actually\\num making the booking secondly\\num users don't\\nhave incentive to say no to really any\\nadditional features if you ask for this\\nfeature or this feature this feature\\nthey'll probably say yes to everything\\nright you however are in charge of the\\nprojectations and you have a lot more\\nincentives than they have to figure out\\nwhich are the most important of the\\nfeatures so let's talk about next steps\\nso you've done your um five or ten of\\nthese user interviews you've written\\ndown your notes let's let's talk about\\nwhat you do then one you want to make\\nsure you have notes from all each of the\\ninterviews you can use sticky notes or\\nsome similar software to organize these\\nlearnings you can bucket them in\\ndifferent buckets that kind of describes\\ndifferent problems and see which one is\\nactually the thing that matters the most\\nand then you want to write down your\\nconclusions what are you learning from\\nall of this you want to use all of this\\ninformation to create a hypothesis or\\nwhat the solution to this problem might\\nbe don't over intellectualize this\\nprocess really you just want to start\\nassigning MVP as fast as you can but you\\nwant to make sure you have accurate\\ninformation when you decide the MEP and\\nthen you'll want to test it with the\\nsame users it's also important to know\\nif the problem you're solving is\\nactually valuable what I mean by this is\\nthat people will value the solution to\\nthe problem enough to pay for it or the\\nproblem itself solving the problem is\\nvaluable so here's some good tips to\\ndetermine if it is one are people paying\\nmoney for other Solutions in the space\\ntoday are the people that make the PDF\\nreports for carbon emissions accounting\\nare they getting paid well if they are\\ngetting paid that's a good sign that\\nthis is probably a valuable thing do\\npeople already have solutions to this\\nproblem they are very happy with even\\nthough it might appear Basics to you for\\nexample like Excel or Google\\nspreadsheets is actually competitors to\\nmany many many hundreds of startups\\nactually quite a formidable one to move\\nsomeone off Excel a Google spreadsheet\\nyou need to make the experience of your\\nsolution dramatically better they're not\\ngoing to pay you hundreds of dollars a\\nmonth for something they can almost as\\neasily do in Google spreadsheet or Excel\\nand three you want to evaluate how easy\\nit is to sell to this audience and this\\nis one thing that I like to do a lot\\nwith the companies I work with for\\nexample selling to Plumbers or\\ncontractors is notoriously difficult\\ncompared to selling to startups the\\nfirst two groups just don't change their\\ntools or the software very often versus\\nstartups are open to trying new things\\nall the time so if you are solving a\\nproblem is valuable you still have to\\nthink about whether it's going to be\\neasy to sell this particular audience\\nonce you have an MVP prototype you can\\nstart by showing it to users even if\\nit's just a design prototype in Envision\\nor something like that you can just\\nclick through we used to do this at MB\\nall the time we would go downstairs in\\nour in our office and we would find some\\npeople that were waiting for an\\ninterview or waiting for getting a\\ncoffee or something and we just show\\nthem the latest version of the app this\\nwould be a Envision prototype on our\\nphone it would be Spike hand them our\\nphone and and show it to them this is\\nstuff that we haven't even built yet the\\nkey thing but if you're doing this\\ntactic is to not tell them what to do do\\nnot tell them what to do just watch them\\nplay around with it you can tell them a\\nspecific goal like try to make a book in\\nAirbnb or try to do a search with dates\\nand even b or something like that but do\\nnot tell them exactly how to solve each\\nscreen remember if this was a real\\nproduct you wouldn't you wouldn't be\\nstanding there next to them to give them\\nadvice another good trick when you're\\ndoing this either when you're listening\\nor having them or recording them is to\\nhave them speak their mind while they're\\ndoing it have them describe exactly what\\nthey're thinking on each of the steps\\nmaybe the words that they're reading\\nmaybe that will give you hints of what\\nwords that they understand and which\\nwords they don't understand or maybe\\nwhat specific screen means or what\\npurpose is and after you've done a bunch\\nof these interviews and then maybe MVP\\nprotest sessions it's a great idea to\\nkeep these interviewees involved\\nthroughout the process\\none common idea that a lot of wasting\\ncompanies are using is to create a slack\\ninstance or a WhatsApp group for with\\ntheir customers now you want to make\\nthem feel special right you want to make\\nthem feel like they have exclusive\\nactive access to the Future world\\nchanging product so think about how\\nyou're wording or or how you communicate\\nthis WhatsApp group that you adding them\\nto it's a great idea to keep showing\\nthem your product as they are\\nprogressing like kind of give them this\\nexclusive feeling that I'm the first one\\nto see this product assets progressing\\nand also as you are\\nreacting to things that they're saying\\nyou can ship a new a new screen with a\\nnew version of the product\\num and that builds trust with it with\\nthem they now know that you react to\\ntheir feedback very fast finally some of\\nthem will love connecting with other\\npeople doing the same thing as they are\\nthey don't get to do this very often and\\num you are the one enabling that if you\\ndo all these steps you will collect the\\nright information\\num from your future users you will keep\\nthem involved and transfer the\\ninformation uh and that allow you to\\ntransfer the information into your first\\nprototype and MVP so to summarize here's\\nwhat I covered today why the best\\nFounders talk to their users throughout\\nthe lifetime of the company\\nhow to find your users and how to talk\\nto them\\nwhat questions to ask them and what not\\nto ask them and finally how to turn some\\nof those conclusions into an MVP thank\\nyou everyone\\n[Music]\\n\""

I\\'ve been here since 2017. Before YC, I was at Airbnb and actually a YC founder back in 2007. Today, I\\'m going to talk about how to talk to your users and your future customers. Here\\'s what I plan to cover today; why the best founders talk to their users throughout the lifetime of the company, how to find your users and how to talk to them, what questions to ask them and what not to ask them, and how to turn your conclusions into an MVP.\"\\n\\nTopic 2: Common misconceptions about startup creation \\nDescription: Discussion about common misconceptions regarding the process of how new startups develop their ideas and products, highlighting the importance of customer interaction.\\nContent: \\n\"Most people in the world have the idea on how new startups form completely wrong. They think ideas of new products is something the founders come up with on a lazy Sunday or a late night coding session. You probably know it doesn\\'t work this way. This scene as you can see here is from The Social Network movie. It\\'s a good movie but they got a lot of things wrong on how Facebook got started.\"\\n\\nTopic 3: The Importance of Customer Interaction in developing a new product\\nDescription: Talk on how customer interaction shapes the development of a new product or service, using the founder of Airbnb as an example.\\nContent:\\n This is Brian Chesky, Brian is a co-founder and CEO of Airbnb. On the left side of the photo is Amal. Amal was the first guest on Airbnb, they spent a weekend together in San Francisco. You notice the difference between this photo and the previous photo. Well, this photo actually is a real photo of a two-way conversation with a real customer. Great founders talk to future customers before they even have a product. In fact, the very best founders in the world learn directly from their users throughout the life of their company.\\n\\nTopic 4: The Benefits of Constant User Feedback\\nDescription: Explanation of the benefits of constant customer feedback and how to effectively use it.\\nContent:\\n\"Users and customers will keep you honest. They are the only stakeholders actually paying you anything. If anyone will tell you the truth, it will be them.

      "====================================\n",
      "So, when you decide to start a business with someone, you have a big job ahead of you. Typically, people who start a business together need to plan for a relationship that might last about 10 years. That's a big step to take with someone you might have only known for a few months, or even just in the work world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's tricky because the only real examples of this type of long-term partnership that you might have seen before are the ones between our moms and dads. So, let's take a quick look at research about successful marriages to help us understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's this guy named John Gottman who studies marriages. He's pretty well-known and has been talked about in a few different places. He has an interesting skill - he can watch a couple argue about something for 15 minutes and then predict with 85% accuracy whether they'll still be married four years later. If he watches them for an hour and also asks about their plans and hopes, his prediction rate jumps to 94%.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shows videos of these couples to different experts like priests, psychologists, and counselors, and even people who are happily married. Yet none of them can predict whether the couple will last as well as John can. \n",

      "He noticed something: how a couple argues can predict how long they will stay together. Surprisingly, he found that it's not about never fighting. Everybody fights, over the same things usually: money, children, intimacy, time, jealousy, and in-laws. Most of the time, they argue about what to do with their free time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And guess what? The same things can cause disagreements when you're starting a business with someone. These are all things you and your business partners might end up arguing about.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if we know everyone has disagreements and we can predict what they will be about, we can prepare for those disagreements. We can plan how to handle those situations. This could be the key to making sure we continue to work together on our passion projects.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Let's talk about how to deal with problems in teamwork. John Gottman found four main things we should stay away from when we have disagreements. Here they are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Criticism: Picture this. You are worried about a work issue, maybe a glitch that needs fixing pronto! You share your fears, but instead of addressing it, someone brings up an unrelated issue. Like the fact that you leave a lot dishes in the sink. Criticizing or bringing up other issues rather than focusing on the problem at hand is not helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Insulting: This one's simple. You voice your worries about the glitch, actually expecting a productive discussion. But, another person says something mean to you. Personal attacks won't fix matters. Remember, we are in a work setting - taking things personally is not fruitful.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Not taking responsibility: Imagine, there's a problem but someone fails to accept they've a part in it, thus delaying the solution. In their eyes, they've done nothing wrong so they see no problem. As a result, there's roadblocks to finding solutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Avoiding problems: This is dangerous. Imagine raising a problem only for the other person to walk away instead of engaging in a conversation. Ignoring the problem will not bring any resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "These four points should help us understand what to avoid when faced with disagreements at work. Remember, the aim should always be to find a resolution, not create more problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Okay, let's take that long explanation and make it much simpler. So, you're making a new business or startup, right? With your business partner, it's important to make a clear plan right from the start. You want to avoid problems, right? There are four things you can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, you can \"divide and conquer\". This just means deciding who is in charge of what parts of the business, right from the beginning. That way, if there's a problem in a certain part of the business, it's obvious who should handle it. This can help avoid arguments and misunderstandings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't worry too much about competition at the start. It usually doesn't cause problems until you're further along. As you go on, you'll assign more and more roles and whoever is in charge of that area will handle problems as they pop up.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens if things get out of control? Well, after you divide up the tasks, it's important to know what a win looks like and what a failure looks like. You need to decide when to step in and help someone with their part. Also, you need to decide how well something needs to be going before you leave it alone and let the person in charge do their thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good times to step in could be once you've gathered the money you need or if your work is being done on time. Bad times could be when you need to stop everything and talk about a big problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you have to have a serious talk, it's important not to get angry or emotional. It can stop you from thinking clearly. Try to set these rules early. It's much easier to talk about difficult things when you're calm and not upset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, remember that in most situations, the final decision comes from the head of the company, the CEO. If there's a problem with the CEO, it's the job of the board. At the start, the board is often just the founders, so you must work it out together. That's your second defense against problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Okay, here's a simpler way to understand that. When working with others, especially someone like a business partner, it's really important to know not only yourself, but also them. This can help avoid misunderstandings.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's some good research from the 1960s that said people have different ways of handling relationships. There are mainly three types. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, there's a group of people who are happy making friends, relying on others, and letting others rely on them. They're okay with sharing feelings and don't mind when others do the same. This is called a 'secure' style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, there are those who feel they don't get enough love and want to hold on to people. They need others to always confirm they love them or want to be with them. This is the 'anxious' style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, there are people who find making friends tough. Sometimes they just want to run away because it's scary, or they're worried about messing up. This is the 'avoidant' style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowing your business partner's style and your own can help you understand and fix any issues that come up. Funny enough, most people are either anxious or avoidant, and these two types usually end up together. This means one person needs space to think things through, while the other needs to be reassured all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't understand what the other person needs, you'll have trouble working together. You both will need to make some changes to make it work. There are many good books and a nice webpage on Wikipedia about these styles. There's also a helpful video on YouTube by School of Life that talks about this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, if you're with someone who is the opposite type, you have to do some extra work. If you're an anxious type and the other person is an avoidant type, understand that they need space. It doesn't mean they're leaving forever. If you're an avoidant type with an anxious type, let them know if you need space. Just say something like, \"I need a bit of time to think about this. We'll talk about it soon.\" And be sure to come back when you said you would.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Sure, happy to make this easier to understand!\n",
      "\n",
      "There may come a time we need to sort out our ideas, and having a written process to do so will help. It'll keep things fair and safe. It's good to set up these rules when everyone is calm and clear-headed. Why? Because when we're mad or emotional, we might not think straight. We may say things we don't mean, and that can lead to bigger problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good example can be seen with a company called Mater. They prepared a simple list on how to handle disagreements. It's a clear guide on what to do when we have different views. It lists different choices, who made the final call, what the decision was, when it was made, and why. When the guide is ready, we don't need to worry when disagreements come up. We just need to fill out this list and it will steer us in the right direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many ways to do this, and you don't need to copy Mater's exact method. Maybe you decide that if there's a strong disagreement, you'll toss a coin to make the decision. The main thing is that the rules are set up beforehand. So, when you're upset, you can just say, \"Alright, we have a plan for this,\" and follow your process. It might suggest taking a short break, eating a sandwich, or even taking a nap before coming back to talk things over. It's all about finding a way that makes sense for everyone involved.\n",

      "====================================\n",
      "Let's make this simple. When you both settle on a plan, it keeps things pleasant. So, to avoid getting upset with one another, find a way to speak that's not scary or hurtful. There's a wonderful book about this, 'Nonviolent Communication' by Marshall Rosenberg. It's all about being honest without being mean or putting others down.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a special way to do this that might seem different if you're not used to talking about feelings. When you want to point out an issue, try saying it like this: \"I saw this thing, it made me feel like this because I wanted this. Can you do this?\". It's not easy to master, but it's proven very helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are four parts to this way of communicating. Let's talk about each part:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Observation**: start with something real, not an opinion. For example, instead of saying someone's lazy, say \"You said you'd send the document last week but I haven't gotten it yet.\" Stick to facts, not opinions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emotion**: next, talk about how the thing you saw made you feel. For example, \"after not getting the document, I felt frustrated.\" Be careful not to mix up feelings and thoughts - feeling \"frustrated\" is valid, but saying \"I feel like you're not taking this seriously\" is actually a thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Need**: understanding why you felt the way you did can often be linked to a basic need. Was it because you missed out on something? Try to figure out what it was you were missing. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Request**: finally, suggest a way to improve the situation. For instance, asking someone to turn up on time rather than simply saying \"be more respectful\". \n",
      "\n",
      "Use these steps next time you have small issues to talk about. It's hard, but practicing will make it easier. If you want more tips, there's a great article by Dave Bailey about how to give useful feedback.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "Sometimes when making a program, we have to take shortcuts to get things done faster. But we know that these quick fixes might cause problems later on. This is called \"technical debt.\" Just like with programming, we can also have \"emotional debt\" in our relationships. That's when we ignore small issues, which can later become big problems. It's best to fix these issues as soon as they come up.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is also true in marriages, according to research by a person named John Gottman. He observed that couples who are happy deal with issues straight away, even if they're small. They never let a problem get bigger by ignoring it. For example, they might say, \"Could you please close your mouth while you're eating? It's disturbing me a bit.\" They deal with issues quickly and kindly. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is similar to running a business with a partner. If something is bothering you, it's better to talk about it as soon as it comes up. That way, small issues won't turn into big ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how do you start doing this? You need to practice. There's a group called YC that talks about three levels of conversations. Level one is simple chats where you exchange facts. Level two involves sharing feelings about things. Level three is about the relationship between two people. In this level, you talk about what's going on right now and why it's important. \n",
      "\n",
      "Doing a startup involves a lot of these level-three talks. That's because many important things need to be discussed within a team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few topics that are good to discuss: Short-term goals, metrics you're using and whether you're meeting your goals. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to make sure everyone knows who's in charge of what. If there's any disagreement, it's good to talk about it and sort it out. \n",
      "\n",
      "You also need to check whether the work is divided in the best way between the team members. Everyone needs to be dedicated and motivated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, you also need to discuss how you'll provide feedback to each other and work out any emotional debt. You need a system to deal with these issues in an honest manner. \n",
      "\n",
      "So to wrap things up, it's important to have regular talks about how things are going in your startup. Clear communication helps prevent small problems from becoming big issues.\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "====================================\n",
      "In our company, we're going to simplify the way we all work together. Everyone has disagreements sometimes, so it's important to have a plan. We need to understand each other's ways of connecting, our roles, and our goals. This is best done before any feelings get involved—think of it like making a decision when you're clear-headed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should use peaceful ways to share open and honest thoughts, without blaming each other. And, we should manage our feelings on a regular basis. This is the best way to prevent small issues from becoming big ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting now, let's not be afraid to discuss tough topics. I'm sure there are things that two, three, four, or even more of us aren't speaking openly about. Thank you very much! Now, why don't we all have a chat with one another?\n",

    "How does caffeine keep us awake? - Hanan Qasim\n",
    "Over 100,000 metric tons\n",
    "of caffeine are consumed around the world every year. That's equivalent to the weight\n",
    "of 14 Eiffel Towers. Most of this caffeine is consumed\n",
    "in coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,\n",
    "focused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,\n",
    "and make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where\n",
    "it serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves\n",
    "and seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,\n",
    "as it's found in nectar, it can actually help them remember\n",
    "and revisit flowers. In the human body, caffeine acts as a\n",
    "stimulant for the central nervous system. It keeps us awake by blocking one of\n",
    "the body's key sleep-inducing molecules, a substance called adenosine. Your body needs a constant supply\n",
    "of energy, which it gets by breaking down\n",
    "a high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,\n",
    "ATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors\n",
    "perfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade \n",
    "of biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important\n",
    "brain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine\n",
    "receptor antagonist. That means it derails this process\n",
    "of slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar\n",
    "molecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into\n",
    "the adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, \n",
    "adenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,\n",
    "so it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors \n",
    "for another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain\n",
    "is to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these\n",
    "paired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine\n",
    "to fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,\n",
    "it doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects\n",
    "on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,\n",
    "reducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,\n",
    "and some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's\n",
    "ability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes \n",
    "an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below\n",
    "a certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects\n",
    "are so helpful. It might make you feel better\n",
    "and more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate\n",
    "and blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages\n",
    "caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body\n",
    "that have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular\n",
    "consumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors \n",
    "are perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job\n",
    "of signaling the brain to power down. That's why you may find you need\n",
    "to consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine\n",
    "receptors to block. It's also why if you suddenly \n",
    "quit caffeine, you may experience \n",
    "an unpleasant withdrawal. With plenty of receptors \n",
    "and no competition, adenosine can work overtime, causing symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and depressed moods. But in a few days, the extra adenosine\n",
    "receptors will disappear, your body will readjust, and you'll feel just as alert as ever, even without an infusion of the world's\n",
    "most popular stimulant. \n",

    "The myth of Prometheus - Iseult Gillespie\n",
    "Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against \n",
    "a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or\n",
    "driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,\n",
    "whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus\n",
    "to fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating \n",
    "all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts\n",
    "of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability \n",
    "to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped\n",
    "the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed \n",
    "they were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants \n",
    "of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient\n",
    "creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude\n",
    "creations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide\n",
    "how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick\n",
    "that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it\n",
    "into two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed \n",
    "the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones\n",
    "under a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly\n",
    "best portion for himself, he was outraged \n",
    "at Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use\n",
    "of fire on Earth, whether to cook meat \n",
    "or for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see\n",
    "his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus\n",
    "to steal fire from the workshop \n",
    "of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk\n",
    "and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness\n",

    "# History of Bugs in Programs\n",
    "In the world of computers, a 'bug' is a fancy word for a mistake or problem in a program. Bugs make programs act in ways we didn't expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The First Bug?\n",
    "A long time ago, in 1947, a real-life moth (yes, the flying kind!) got stuck inside a computer. This caused the machine to go haywire. The engineers who found it joked that they \"debugged\" the computer by removing the moth. That's the archaic story how the term 'bug' came into the world of computing! But did it, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before computers looked like the machines we know today, people used the term 'bug' to describe glitches and hitches in electrical systems. Thomas Edison, the famous inventor, even mentioned \"bugs\" in his writings from the 1870s!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Expanding World of Bugs:\n",
    "As computers evolved, so did bugs. From simple mechanical glitches, bugs grew into complex software issues. They weren't just pesky problems but started influencing big events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Ariane 5 Rocket (1996)**: A tiny bug in its software caused this European rocket to explode shortly after its launch. Ouch!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Y2K Bug**: As the world approached the year 2000, there was a global panic about computers not recognizing '00' as the year 2000 but as 1900. Thankfully, massive efforts debugged the potential mess!\n",

    "# First Karel Program\n",
    "Let's write your first Karel program, you know all the commands already. Imagine that Karel lives in the world below\n",
    "\n",
    "![World before](/images/intro-to-programming-js-en/4_first_program_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You job is to write program, where Karel will take the beeper on the (2,1) corner, will put it on the (4,2) corner and finish working on (5,2). After program execution world should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![World after](/images/intro-to-programming-js-en/4_first_program_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy enough with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "move\n",
    "pickBeeper\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "move\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "turnLeft\n",
    "move\n",
    "move\n",
    "putBeeper\n",
    "move\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, this is not a program yet. This is the instruction to solve the problem, but it's for humans to understand not for Karel. This is not a program this is an algorithm. Let's turn it to program. To do this we must turn all the commands into the **functions**. Basically **functions** are commands that could be executed. To do that we will just need to add `();` symbols at the end of all the commands. That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "move();\n",
    "pickBeeper();\n",
    "turnLeft();\n",
    "move();\n",

    "# `for` Loop in Karel\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases we need to repeat some Karel commands several times, We could copy and paste the commands, but it's way better to use the `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally copy and pasting the code is not a good idea, we end up with the same code in different places. Which makes code changes tricky and error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume Karel is on the corner of the first street and first avenue - or coordinates (1,1). We want to pick a beeper that is on coordinates(100,1). Pretty straightforward right? We have to write a program with 99 `move();`s and a single `pickBeeper();` at the end. But copying `move();` that many times is quite time-taking and in the process we might miscount add an extra `move();` or miss one. The good news is we can use `for` loop and do it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < some_number; i++) {\n",
    "    Commands that we want to repeat\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loop consists of 2 parts the header and the body. The header defines number of iterations - or how many times you want to repeat something. And the body defines what you want to repeat - a set of instructions that will be repeated several times. Let's do not dwell on the exact meaning of the `for (let i = 0; i < some_number; i++)` the only thing interesting here is the `some_number` where you can write the actual number - how many times you want to repeat the instructions. And inside the `for` loop or in the body you can write the actual set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the program to solve our stated problem goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 99; i++) {\n",
    "    move();\n",
    "}\n",
    "pickBeeper();\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you notices we used tab inside the `for` loop to make clearer for the code reader that `move();` part of the `for` loop's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Several instructions in `for`\n",
    "Of course we can put several instructions inside the `for` loop. In this case `for` loop executes these set of instructions one by one on each iterations. And the number of iterations is determined in the header of the loop. You can imagine that `for` loop just copies whatever it has inside and pastes it several times. So the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n",
    "    move();\n",
    "    turnLeft();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is exactly the same as the code:\n",

    "turnLeft();\n",
    "move();\n",
    "turnLeft();\n",

and then if you come. up with the idea together. and perhaps you fundraise together then. you\\'ll have collective ownership that. it\\'s your idea and it\\'s your company.versus a lot of times when you add. co-founders later. in their mind it\\'s your company. it\\'s not their company and even though. you know you worked on the company an. extra month than the other person did. which is so silly right you\\'ll always. have this like well this wasn\\'t my idea. this wasn\\'t my company.um which isn\\'t great from a retention. perspective if you can both really feel. like you shepherded the idea through the. earliest stages you\\'re going to see a. lot more ownership and people stepping. up when you go through hard times to. reiterate what we talked about at the. beginning. i don\\'t want to say co-founders are. essential. but man they\\'re so helpful it\\'s such a. powerful tool. especially in the hardest part of the. startup the pre-product market fit. startup we still encourage everyone to. have a co-founder. um but like the startup game right it\\'s. not about doing it well it\\'s about doing. it great like having a great co-founder. can be a super power for your company. having an okay co-founder not taking. this seriously.can be the seed of big problems.absolutely and sometimes people they end. up with co-founder issues i\\'m like well. i guess i\\'m just going to quit and start. a new company and we\\'ll well well it\\'s. so easy to start a new company and then. it\\'s like well good luck and then you. speak to them a year or two later and. it\\'s. really hard to get back to where they. were in the moment and one of the. regrets is they wish they would have. spent the time. to set up the co-founder relationship. well and choose the right person first. then think they can just. blow everything up and get a do-over. that\\'s just not how life works and so. the more you can front-load this the. first time around versus having hard. earned lessons. yeah
