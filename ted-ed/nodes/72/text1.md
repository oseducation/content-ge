In the year 1066, 7000 Norman infantry and knights sailed  in warships across the English Channel. Their target: England,  home to more than a million people. Theirs was a short voyage with massive consequences. And around the same period of time, other groups of Normans were setting forth all across Europe, going on adventures that would reverberate throughout that continent’s history. So who were these warriors and how did they leave  their mark so far and wide? Our story begins  over 200 years earlier, when Vikings began to settle  on the shores of northern France as part of a great Scandinavian exodus  across northern Europe. The French locals called  these invaders Normans, named for the direction they came from. Eventually, Charles,  the king of the Franks, negotiated peace with  the Viking leader Rollo in 911, granting him a stretch of land  along France’s northern coast that came to be known as Normandy. The Normans proved adaptable to their newly settled life. They married Frankish women, adopted the French language, and soon started converting  from Norse paganism to Christianity. But though they adapted, they maintained the warrior tradition and conquering spirit  of their Viking forebears. Before long, ambitious Norman knights  were looking for new challenges. The Normans’ best-known achievement  was their conquest of England. In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, disputed the claim of  the new English king, Harold Godwinson. Soon after landing in England, William and his knights met Harold’s army  near the town of Hastings. The climactic moment in the battle is immortalized in  the 70-meter-long Bayeux Tapestry, where an arrow striking Harold  in the eye seals the Norman victory. William consolidated his gains  with a huge castle-building campaign and a reorganization of English society. He lived up to his nickname  "William the Conqueror" through a massive survey known as the Domesday Book, which recorded the population and ownership of every piece of land in England. Norman French became the language  of the new royal court, while commoners continued  to speak Anglo-Saxon. Over time, the two merged  to give us the English we know today, though the divide between lords  and peasants can still be felt in synonym pairs such as cow and beef. By the end of the 12th century, the Normans had further expanded  into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Meanwhile, independent groups  of Norman knights traveled to the Mediterranean, inspired by tales of pilgrims  returning from Jerusalem. There, they threw themselves  into a tangled mass of conflicts among the established powers  all over that region. They became highly prized mercenaries, and during one of these battles, they made the first recorded  heavy cavalry charge with couched lances, a devastating tactic that soon became  standard in medieval warfare. The Normans were also central  to the First Crusade of 1095-99, a bloody conflict that re-established Christian control in certain parts of the Middle East. But the Normans did more than just fight. As a result of their victories, leaders like William Iron-Arm  and Robert the Crafty secured lands throughout Southern Italy, eventually merging them to form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. Under Roger II, the kingdom became a beacon of multicultural tolerance in a world torn apart  by religious and civil wars. Muslim Arab poets and scholars  served in the royal court alongside Byzantine Greek sailors  and architects. Arabic remained an official language along with Latin, Greek, and Norman French. The world’s geographical knowledge  was compiled in The Book of Roger, whose maps of the known world would remain the most accurate  available for 300 years. And the churches built in Palermo combined Latin-style architecture, Arab ceilings, and Byzantine domes, all decorated with exquisite golden mosaics. So if the Normans were so successful, why aren’t they still around? In fact, this was a key part of their success: not just ruling the societies  they conquered, but becoming part of them. Although the Normans eventually  disappeared as a distinct group, their contributions remained. And today, from the castles and cathedrals that dot Europe’s landscape to wherever  the English language is spoken, the Norman legacy lives on.
